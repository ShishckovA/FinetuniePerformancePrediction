0,in theory this is good keyboard but impractical practical use it just not it dies way too often and am video editor cannot have those kinds of problems time is money
1,i bought two of these as gifts couple of christmases ago just recently found out both recipients lost their usb receivers klim support quickly mailed both recipients out new usb receivers free of charge even after the warranty had been expired can speak for product itself but klim support is top notch will buy from klim again

1,entertainment wasn happy that it didn come with charger 
1,i bought this mouse to match the keyboard bought for my daughter to use with her laptop she does online school and likes having mouse as well as keyboard she likes that they match and both light up didn know how it would be for gaming 
1,i had solid green back lit keyboard that stopped working wanted another solid color but could not find one so bought this one that has multi color back light have to say like it better also the keys feel much more substantial and it has an on off switch that like as well works from decent distance also recommend

1,bought this for gaming and love them
1,amazing tool for my job that required lot of documentation 
1,i love that it change colors it sleek and easy to control will most definitely order another one 
1,love this new mouse work from home for my job still and use my mouse all day everyday was originally using big bulky gaming mouse it lights up and looked cool for the last years but now my hand is starting to hurt and was ready to downgrade to something smaller and lighter saw this and had to see what it was about let me tell you love this new mouse its so small and light and easy to use the clicks are super quiet and feels so great in the hand yes it is plastic but it actually doesn feel cheap and feels like good build it very responsive and glides very smooth the only gripe is to wake of up from sleep you have to click the mouse button instead of just moving it like most items but that very minor issue oh and the different colors it comes in is nice also the rgb color changing lighting is very nice effect definitely recommend this mouse for home or office use 
1,so far like it it has great sound quality 
1,this headset has blown me away by how good it is very good quality if you are looking for just basic do the job type of headset this is it 
0,wouldn even mind the fact that have to keep it plugged in of the time if it actually stayed plugged in 
0,very cheaply made another you get what you pay for suggest you pass 
0,received speaker in april am having problems with the battery not lasting put battery charging and it doesn go any further than bars gets stuck on th bar blinking not sure what is the next step 
1,i really enjoying this headset am saddened by the fact that for one of the headsets the mic doesn work yes we ve tried all the troubleshooting options but they re are working very well for me for my ps gaming purposes literally the only comment have is more of minor annoyance don care for the distance of the split for the jack and the usb while playing with controller the usb is useless but it can get in the way at times even when wrap it up with the velcro strap it comes with it be nice if could slide the plastic point where it splits to give myself more slack since can use the usb anyways but it really not that hard to move past just annoying overall very happy with my purchase 
1,sounds really great so far so good 
1,sound quality and ease of operation were great we bought the unit in december of and now it won power up we tried to re set it and nothing happens so now we have to buy another unit not sure what to buy 
1,my son loves it 
1,first one received only lasted one week but the return process was quick do really like the second one mainly because of the lights know shallow right 
1,i bought this as needed replacement headset that utilized usb connections this uses mm connections for audio the usb connection just turns on the leds so it looks great but doesn do jack in addition the headset itself is uncomfortable heaven help you if you already have headache and you throw pair of these on congratulations to the manufacturers have never returned an item to amazon before this one you have won the prize 
0,long battery life due to sleep mode was impressed until scroll wheel stopped working would have otherwise recommended highly
0,we have tried to plug them into different controllers and still can get the mic to work on them and when the mic works you can hear anything
1,there really nothing to dislike about it love the fact that don have to run out and buy batteries every time it starts to act like it not going to work the way it charges is one of the main reasons that bought it rather save the for batteries and get something else instead of worrying if have enough spare batteries have mouse pad that has breathing mode and the mouse goes along with its own pattern to make the two of them an excellent night light of sorts for the amount spent give this mouse also love the fact that it easy to pack it up with my laptop and go anywhere without worrying again if my mouse will run out of power think that there should be more accessories that can charge from usb port rather than lugging around extra batteries 
1,very clean sound better than expected
0,i like the sturdy cord it doesn pinch or come apart which was the selling point for me 
1,perfect little mouse this mouse is so easy to use and to charge up it lightweight love the little colors and it fits my hand perfectly
1,i bought it for my boyfriend and his exact words where the quality is juicy meaning it was the best choice for him to do his gaming
1,i bought these for work they allow me to blockout most of the conversations in the room and allow me to focus on my own thoughts sound quality is good listen to music audiobooks and participate in video conferences they are not too heavy am able to wear them all day with my mask and eyeglasses they do not apply extra pressure to me ears 
0,i like idea of not needing batteries but needs approvements 
1,ok admit it love the colors necessary nope super fun yup just adds little playfulness to my office desk works great comes with charging cord charge lasts long time love it 
0,the stupid lights cannot be turned off it runs the battery flat every night if you forget to recharge the mose you are sunk in single day it is uncomfortable and decides you have released mouse key by itself very annoying it is in my rubbish bin 
1,love the sound
1,i use this product for online gaming extremely happy bought the headset now can communicate and hear other players 
1,it size is perfect for both travel and for my hands the led is great feature and works just as well as the wired one for my pc even bought my mother one and she loves it too 
0,the adapter for the laptop doesn work have one from dell which worked fine 
0,i needed small mouse for travel it working well it has dpi settings which haven explored yet not crazy about it being rechargeable prefer batteries but the rechargeable battery likely makes it lighter and smaller 
1,i bought for my daughter and she loves it 
1,this headset is by far the best one after trying couple of devices great for school and gaming 
1,love the color love the size have jbl extreme and bought this for my babe for christmas the sound is solid was so surprised great buy great price and great quality 
1,this mouse is quiet as advertised so it nice as someone sleeps in my office while do schoolwork most of the time the sleep mode on it is nice but feel it triggers too soon that being said it bothersome but not deal breaker was concerned about the quality upon receiving it as it is quite light and feels cheaply made sure it is but it traveled in my laptop case quite successfully without incident knock on wood sure if dropped or enough pressure was put on it it could very well break or crack but if you treat it well don see why this mouse shouldn last you ve had it for about month now and the only thing can complain about is the sleep timer so take that as you will 
0,absolute garbage listen to the negative reviews and the ones saying the company is spamming them begging to remove their posts the lights are haywire with no pattern randomly switching off and on dpi is not adjustable pretty sure that lie feels like the lowest grade plastic ve ever felt does not track lights will give you seizure without doubt this company is scamming you 
0,vote for trump 
0,lights were nice but one of the keys was broken
1,i bought this to replace an old headset was pleasantly surprised comfy decent sound and picks up my voice well perfect for casual gaming and watching videos 
1,it was easy to connect and worked great then it worked for while was perfect then it job stopped working out of nowhere
0,this didn last months before it stopped taking charge will not be buying another one 
1,so originally was introduced to jbl speakers when the charge first came out loved it and was immediately fan and remain to be fast forward to have been telling any and everyone come across that when ever in question go with jbl so this last christmas someone baught me the jbl flip and was just confused the sound quality the base even the bluetooth connection would kick me off about every third song returned no problem only wanted replacement anyway received the second one and again like the jbl look and feel was there but the sound quality especially the base was just lacking was disappointed thinking that the company just dived after the charge so after getting refund from the second flip spent think it was an extra dollar and there it was the sound that made me fan to begin with if you re just trying out jbl speakers would recommend spending just the few extra dollars for the charge models see that the flip and have almost perfect rating on amazon so maybe it just my opinion but believe the quantity all around of the charge is better representative of the jbl brand the battery in the charge seems to drain quicker than the flip but put my speaker threw it passes from the moment turn it on in the morning until am ready to relax in the evening literally have nothing negative to say about the bluetooth connection no problem at all the sound quality is just awesome love music period believe music is the best and purist way to control moods mentally emotionally spiritually and even physically listen to anything from gospel to heavy metal blues country rap etc have noticed that if the music being listened to is heavy in base the lyrics will be more clear if you just lower the volume maybe or pushes of the button if you re listening to sax or blues guitar albert king for example it only gets better the higher you go garth brooks or lauren daigle just over half way of volume and the vocals and piano will be front and center and so on even at just little more than half way more than what you would need in the back patio or yard man can wait till can get enough for the extreme or the boom box hope this was helpful to someone god bless
0,excelente
0,very good
0,the mouse never turned on complete waste of money not happy
1,love it 
1,very nice product received it in two days as promised with prime only needed to charge it initially for about an hour my samsung phone paired with the speaker in about seconds the sound is great and this is just what was looking for to provide music while work on projects in the basement and garage 
0,it was great while it lasted days before the wireless receiver failed the keyboard itself still turns on and has lights though so there is at least that going for it 
1,perfect no comment everything is pretty good
0,it changes color and that feature can be switched on and off but that it it doesn work at all as mouse with my macbook even with using the included receivers 
1,maybe had crazy expectation for this but just feel like it not loud there no bass at all probably going to return it find something little bit better 
0,nothing but issues the scroll wheel broke for no reason at all no longer holds charge would not recommend 
1,so cute great night light long battery no issues loveeeee it oh and it also pauses by itself when not in use which is cool
0,the cord is very long and usually gets in the way when first got my it would make static noises and also echo other people suggest getting different mic 
0,thinnest mouse have ever seen 
0,well it was good while it lasted for year but will never buy an off brand wireless gaming keyboard again battery sucks on this keyboard had to charge it at least once week it was so annoying that just left the cable on the keyboard which defy the purpose of getting wireless keyboard then the keyboard would start having weird behavior it would freeze up or if type it would get stuck on letter and repeat it times so done with this junk fyi rarely used this keyboard for gaming only use it for everything web surfing need the illuminated light cause my work space is dark 
0,great mouse overall but the middle click button needs lot of pressure to click which is quite annoy other than that would have given it star 
1,perfect for nintendo switch son loves them 
0,the mouse is cute and work but do feel like there is some delay especially when im working between monitors ve been using this mouse for little over month now and the right click just broke randomly so theres that 
0,one night your headphones break and you check amazon for new pair of cheap headphones you may stumble across pair of nice looking headphones which are only and whopping discount trust me there is reason these nightmare bengoo are more than half off you may think these headphones look legit but once you plug them into your controller all hell breaks loose not only will the legendary bengoos lodge out of your controller about times per minute if you are ever in gaming party want to say good luck to the other soldiers in that chat they may think you just bought new pair of nice headphones but little do they know they are about to enter the midst of modern war fare multiplayer lobby the sound everyone hears when you pop on the bengoos mirror the sound of precision air strike happening in the mic one would assume you are in the middle of war if you are ever thinking of acquiring pair of bengoo headphones make sure you don have any friends because you will lose them very quickly when you destroy their ears in game chat am warning you now once you acquire bengoo the rest is on you good sir 
1,i bought the white one and at first it was only lighting up red and thought the picture was misleading then realized the on off switch on the bottom actually serves two functions one click on will turn the mouse on and glowing red two clicks on and the rainbow colors appear will say the white mouse is almost translucent the rainbow colors illuminate the whole mouse not just the sides it plug and play very easy to use and comfortable 
1,it doesn have tail so it more of hamster but it is very nice hamster it lights up really nicely and it is very accurate control of the cursor can speak on it for gaming as only use it for working from home but did like it enough to buy one for my work desk as well obviously did indeed by it again 
0,mouse was advertised as quiet but it is far from quiet it has the loudest sound have ever heard from mouse when clicking the middle button disappointed in the clearly false advertising 
0,had it for only one day until accidentally dropped it from less than meter and the stroller wheel broke could fix it with superglue but come on shouldn have to do that it was cheaply made and it literately broke day if you re thinking of buying this don let me stop you from trying it just don drop it

1,absolutely love the sound from this speaker 
1,i had to replace my mouse and decided to try this mouse out since it had lot of reviews it works great the mouse looks good and has sleek design the led lights are fun touch and the dpi feature is nice to have had zero issues connecting the mouse to my macbook wirelessly to with the usb port what did notice was my hand started to feel uncomfortable with only an hour of use coming from mouse that had an arch in the design this mouse was little flatter than that another are the clicks and scrolls it definitely is not quiet when it comes to clicking and scrolling it not loud like compared to regular mice but it is louder than my previous quiet mouse did end up returning the mouse but would still recommend this to those who like this mouse design it still great mouse overall 
0,they are uncomfortable after about minutes if you have glasses
0,like it
1,i really like this keyboard it great because it pretty and lightweight don like that the charger is so weird though it has tendency to get loose that the only thing found wrong though don leave the power on don think this has sleep mode you ll come back and this thing will be stone dead lol always shut this off when done with it

1,sounds good perfect for my fishing boat
0,slim and ergonomic mouse cool led lights while using it 
0,a little disappointed with the brightness and the fact that it sleeps immediately after use
1,there are two things like about this wireless mouse it rechargeable it took me while to get used to plugging it into my laptop when not using it but it easy through the usb cable they provide and the charge lasts and while there is an on off button it not so necessary as it goes into sleep mode when close my laptop all told am very satisfied with this mouse 
1,this is great value mouse purchased it to go with my new laptop so didn have to depend on the trackpad the design is nice and colors are great addition 
1,this is very good sleek and easy to use mouse really like the colored lights the charge lasts long time have no cons and would buy again use this wireless mouse with my dell all in one 
1,thay sound great
1,sleek attractive and the color change option is beautiful you can keep solid red or let the colors rotate 
1,i love the clarity and the bass especially how loud it gets worth the money 
1,was bigger than my last speaker and louder to if you like to feel like you re at concert than buy this one 
0,i have had this mouse for all of minutes and am planning on returning it honestly it looks nice and like that it rechargable however it easily one of the worst ve ever used ve used probably different models in my career alone first clicking the mouse requires much stronger force than any other mouse ve used and on top of that it very inconsistent looking through the gaps where the leds show out of can see the mechanical device which actuates the click is tiny plastic arm no chance that will lasts for an expected period of time it seemed to have been packaged fine so don believe it was damaged or doa don buy this 
1,pros good audio quality good volume output cool lightscons can get uncomfortable after long use
1,i love this mouse ve had others before but never like this it was so easy to connect just plug in the usb connector and thats it no drivers to install or to download works right out the box its so natural when using this mouse even used it when was in the coach and it worked perfectly on the arm rest would recommend this all day good product 
0,i bought this for my year old son now he not the most careful but these things broke within month would not recommend for kids but if you treat them right now you shouldn have problem 
1,it works great used it for my school and it works really well 
1,i love it overall since my laptop keyboard are bit sticky for some reason so using this keyboard actually is bit bigger keep missing the enter button all the time but overall love it 
1,i got this mouse for my year daughter for christmas she loves how it fits her hands and how is changes colors what she likes the most is how quiet it is when clicking the button the family wireless mouse is bit loud when clicked she will be using it for school and her chromebook not really gaming mouse and there is only buttons and wheel 
1,met all expectations could be little louder but that just how like my music great sound quality also 
1,great headphones nice selection of colors and can be used on multiple devices
1,amazing headset would recommend
0,waste of money never charged and never worked waited to late to return so it ll go in the trash 
1,i like how easy it flow while using it also how it lights up in different colors comfortable in my palm too would recommend
1,it came really fast got it in one day it is really sleek and works really smooth chose my favorite color of course but love all the colors the light goes through also really like that it has button to keep the mouse on but turn off the light and of course it is nice that you can charge it rather than use batteries the other mouse have have to use batteries so that was major selling point for this one 
0,for gaming and sleep mode helps out lot in college
0,this was the worst mouse ve bought it goes dead very fast and then you have to charge it all night for it to die fast again would not recommend this mouse 
1,best keyboard for gaming works with xbox consoles and playstation consoles as well battery life is amazing only charged it twice since and only had it for months out of 
0,the year warranty reeled me in unfortunately needed the key feature to work and neither the light indicator nor the key functions worked it also had initial charging issues it took days to charge then it was charging but not for very long hrs cs said the only option was to exchange so did the exchange charged right away but the key caps indicator didn work the key functions didn work either the cs on the exchange told me that could have just returned it the first time and not go through the exchange process that process turnaround time was couple of weeks lost spend more money and get better keyboard one with established reviews track record in this case year warranty was marketing only because the keyboard never performed at

0,this product has malfunctioned and been glitchy sine the day got it the bluetooth never worked properly with the unit automatically disconnecting and shutting off kept assuming operator error but that is not the case have done factory reset and googled troubleshooting have barely used it and it no longer charges intermittently connects on bluetooth for few days this speaker would work when directly connected to my phone however after minutes the unit automatically turns off while plugged in to power troubleshoot on the web revealed many problems don buy this 
1,superior sound quality well worth the price it rocks out the fire pit area in my backyard perfectly

0,batterylife not good
1,great product
0,the design is pretty but the functionality is crappy my mouse censor keeps glitching in and out which makes it impossible to work with definitely will be returning which is really annoying because it took forever to arrive and it was supposed to be replacement for my previous wireless mouse that fell to its death from the nd floor last week 
1,this was nice mouse wouldn recommend for children as it broke when dropped on floor adult use seems like it would be fine 
1,the battery doesn even last one day pretty much have to keep it plugged in at all times and have the light setting turned off it looks like nice mouse and the wheel and clicking is fine but what the point if it never charged don waste your money on this mouse 
0,jbl has always been go to for me can go wrong with this one love the color ocean blue the bass hits we all dig it at work buy this speaker 
1,its decent all around but the mic quality is kinda bad and the sound quality like bass wise could also use some work but overall pretty good
1,works great son loves it
1,it was okay at first it lagged lot know it wasn an issue with my laptop cause ve used wireless mouses of different types before so got this one after few days it completely stopped working even after charging it it refused to connect and work definitely won buy this again and letting my friend know not to get it either it was just letdown 
0,couldn beat the price on this headset just wanted something cheap that would work decent of course it seems like pretty cheap plastic but it doesn really bother me they don hurt my head ears or anything like that when wear them for long periods of time unlike other headphones headsets they light up which is cool but you can plug that part into controller because it usb for the lighting overall haven had any complaints from the people play with online no comments about how bad it sounds or anything so assuming the mic works just fine and so does the sound that comes through the headset 
0,only worked few weeks and thats it waste of money whats worse is barely used it 
1,used for months and now it won charge 
1,the scroll wheel on the mouse broke after less than week of using it liked the mouse before that it was easy to setup comfortable to use and the colors look nice really liked the silent mouse click but now that can scroll with the mouse will need to buy new one
0,it works very well the only thing is cannot get the led lights to light up 
1,really happy with the purchase considering the money paid the sound has been crystal clear remember this is not usd headphone so lets not consider this with bose or sony products also it comes with the required accessories so you can use this with the desktop the build is really good and it holds very good 
0,i purchased gold they sent black tried to send it back but amazon couldn afford gas so the place needed to return it to was inconvenient so kept it big mistake got it at end of april and the scroll portion is already broken sham of mouse and company

1,perfect beat purchase have made this year 
1,live this speaker got it brand new for and has great sound live that can charge phone on it too 
1,this is the first mouse have bought for my new pc probably the best purchase have made for my pc it great to use anywhere it so quiet and smooth looking it fits in the palm of my hand nicely the colors are bit off but great for how cheap it was really like that it was cheap too but it wasn cheaply made or seemed like it recommend it was bit trickcy to figure out how to connect it to my pc do have both usbc and usb on here but keep in mind that if you have usb pc you will have to take out the connecter in the mouse its hard to get it out of though do save the box for the usbc connector and charger 
0,i used this mouse for work as am hybrid worker and do most work in the field or different workspaces when the mouse leaves my home office to go with me it has its own individual protective padded case in my work bag worked great until it just stopped working which is very disappointing after almost months the mouse still lights up looks like it works took charge from the charger but will not move on the screen in my work computer thinkpad or personal computer macbook that said either the mouse internally stopped working in some aspect or the usb dongle is defective per my it consultant tried all possible usb ports even those on my apple magic keyboard and still does not move on the screen also tried every idea could find to reset repair the issue in line to no avail it is disappointing and huge inconvenience this happened you would expect product to last more than months for my coworkers that asked about my mouse as they thought it was cool they will now be told it died only after short period of time and cautioned if they decide to buy one have yet to hear back from their customer service and not sure ever will maybe it is true after all you get what you pay for now need to buy another new mouse which was something hoped to not have to worry about for long time please keep in mind do not leave this review to bash the company this review is to let people know my experience with the mouse like said it worked great until it just stopped working still lights up just will not move on my screen for no apparent reason as it work the night before buyer beware 
0,does not pair well at all with jbl connect bought this to connect to my jbl boombox it paired and did the whole jbl connect which jbl specifically offers it worked for about month then started having problems connection was lost in minute distortion even had them just foot apart and still dissapointing buy it for solo use not for jbl connect

0,the scroll wheel stopped working after month very frustrated 
0,it stopped working after falling on the floor 
0,really like the size of this speaker big sound in compact size 
1,luv this speaker was disappointed when received it cause it looked small and thought how such speaker of this size could satisfy me but then hooked it up and wow downloaded an equalizer app from the google store and now have full control on my listening pleasures and great sounds can control the sounds thru my tablet the speaker itself and the equalizer app all three have volume control truly not sorry bought this speaker take it with me hook it up in the trunk of my car and the sound just resonates with the truck door open the enclosure of the car trunk makes the sound incredible great buy 
1,this does work with the xbox series you do need to adjust the volume initially on the xbox itself the led lights only work when connected to usb overall great sound but wish the bass was little better
1, update have finally tried with my pc and tried on both mine and my husbands and the sound works fine it not very noise canceling but it is nice to hear the base and actually pick up on detail otherwise wouldn have heard without it the downfall is that the mic won work at all of course played with the toggle and made sure it wasn my computer settings and it still isn working put in for return so hopefully this one is defective and the new headset will be better super bummed because really wanted to like this headset bought this gaming headset specifically for my ps and as advertised it states that it is compatible and it is not have the original sony ps controllers so it not even like using off brand ve tried with both of my controllers and nothing have not tried with my pc yet will update my review once try it with the pc
1,excellent very satisfied with this buy

0,producers started out great then months in and the mic stopped working and headset stopped connecting to the xbox waste of money 
0,absolutely beautiful and sleek never worked charged it until it indicated it was fully charged but it never worked 
1,love the sound it the same size as the charge superb sound
0,pretty easy to use and set up comes with charger expected the lights to be bit more appealing but they re mainly just solid colors when you have it on the led light mode fits snug with my hands and does the job for the most part so complain probably wouldn use for gaming purposes though 
1,the sound quality is great mic tested fine the quality of the materials seems bit cheap though the cushion for the top of the head was bit minimal the ear muffs were bit small and did not really provide sufficient room for your ears to be comfortably inside them my ears were aching hurting within hours of wearing the headphones if you re kid these will probably work out great for you an adult pass em up 
0,broken from box
1,this came with an charging attachment but why this uses normal cell phone charger port and all the intuitions are in chinese theres random button at the top and when press it nothing happens and dont know how to tell how much charge there is on it other than that really like it so far its very sleek

0,bought this months ago stopped working yesterday tried charging it and using it on different surfaces nothing curser won budge definitely not worth it now looking for new one 
0,i am very disappointed with the quality of life this mouse has bought it and was only able to use it four or five times and it has been problem for me ever since ve charged it adequately and it won start not sure if its factory malfunction or not but it should still be working ve owned it for little over month now 
0,just stopped working after seven months 
0,just not enough bass on the flip side bought the next step up the jbl boom box and it had to much bass chose too much bass over to little bass 
1,sound quality is excellent no complaints here 
0,not as good as the charge 
0,i am giving it stars because it does cut in and out at times 
1,this is great buy and they have amazing customer service so had to buy this wireless keyboard especially for my second monitor lastly it lasts very long like days long my only wish is for hair trigger like keys for rhythm games or fps but other wise great buy 
0,i bought this weeks ago and now the scroll doesn work if you need mouse choose something other than this 
0,the headset was uncomfortable and heavy the plastic felt cheap and it looks better in the picture all around couldn have rated this any higher than one star 
1,with the price was skeptical but this mouse really does work well as soon as plugged in the usb it took all of second before could start using it the clicks are smooth and quiet and it feels great ergonomically the lights also look really good highly recommend it 
0,had the mouse charging all weekend via my desktop pc within an hour and half this of working the darn thing stopped working don know if it went into sleep mode or not but could not get it to work at all leading me to believe it lost its charge therefore had to plug it back in to charge seriously considering returning it will give it one to two more days to see if it stays charged longer than few hours if it does not will be returning it for full refund 
1,i started with the jbl charge and was surprised how long it survived before had to retire it and upgrade to the jbl charge these speakers are built to last and have amazing sound quality as well as battery life will be an owner of this line of bluetooth speaker for life 
0,this mouse quit working just one day past the return date and now am stuckusing this mouse as doorstop take my advice and purchase anything but this one 
1,my son sats the are awesome and they have lasted longer then other headphones have purchased for him great price 
0,this mouse is very slow in reaction not sensitive to the movement and make my hand tiring already after minutes usage too bad only start using it after the return window closed 
1, this is so cute love how it changes colors it is small but not too small 
0,i bought this mouse in june month later the wheel stopped working like the gold color and the smoothness of it but the wheel is something that would consistently need to use 
1,this is nice streamlined mouse it is responsive and rolls smoothly
0,good
1,the keyboard is quiet and the backlight is really nice the keyboard is functioning correctly as am typing the review right now however the design itself has some problems if were to describe the feeling of typing on it it feels somewhat sticky as though am typing into quicksand this is likely because for the design to be quiet it blunts the speed of key pressing and returning to its original position honestly wouldn have minded the noise if it meant better typing experience as it feels like actually expending effort to type each key the charger port also has issues with the male usb cable plugging in it has lots of resistance and only goes in like mm with exposed metal when the charge is active all in all think the keyboard is nice and the bluetooth feature is godsend but the quality is pushing the envelope in satisfaction 
1,very easy to set up works perfectly fine with my macbook air 
1,wasn sure like the smooth style of the mouse but love it gonna buy one in another color as backup just incase
0,broke after weeks of having it 
1,great mouse especially for the price the led lights are awesome works perfect and easily connects to your device 
1,as described great product
1,i bought this headset for my daughter to use for pc gaming it is comfortable good sound quality and seems durable friends say microphone sound quality is good as well 
0,cheap for reason doesnt work after months guess that is why the return policy is just days do not waste your time on this item complete garbage 
0,upon unpackaging the item everything was as advertised and instructions were simple and easy to follow however after coupe of uses the battery was no longer holding charge the light would turn on indicating that it was charging and couple of minutes later the light was off told myself that maybe the mouse was charging even though the light was not on so left it on to charge for couple of hours unfortunately the mouse was not charging as it was already dead after five minutes of use found myself using my laptop mouse more often then this mouse due to this ergonomic design and lighting is great but kind of useless given that the mouse did not fulfill its main purpose star 
0,will be returning middle track roller does not work if the mouse sits idle for to long it loses wireless connection with the computer and you have to shut it off and turn it back on the led color changer is cool other than that it just ok 
0,it exactly as bad as should have expected for the price ve had it for days and it will randomly stop working have to turn it off and on again to get the mouse to begin working again the plastic it made out of is cheaper than it looks in the picture honestly should have spent few more bucks and bought something better 
0,it fairly bright but you re stuck with the one rainbow color pattern and some of the colors are not as bright as others making typing in the dark harder than it should be the keys are raised up and beveled like keyboard from years ago so the striking surface is smaller than on newer keyboards this makes typing and accuracy little slower some of the keys are placed little weird too the key to the left of the enter key usually has the apostrophe and quotation mark this one has the backslash and vertical line as was used to my last keyboard kept putting backslashes where apostrophes should be ll likely be replacing this soon 
1,it looks awesome and is really quiet only had it for short time but love it 
1,this is good product it fits well in my hand and love that it is rechargeable would buy this mouse again don use it for gaming since that is something don do it serves my purpose well 
0,with all my volumes up and cranked its so quite 
0,just ordered this as nice wireless mouse for my surface pro it works nice but when went to pull the usb out of the surface pro part of it stayed stuck in the port had to use pliers to pull it out not sure if this just tight fit or poor workmanship other than that the mouse works fine 
0,i ve had this for few weeks and it already useless it won charge when connected horrible 
1,love it
1,great headset came really fast and works great 
1,i like the feel of the keys colors and brightness
0,holds charge forever 
1,bought and love that they cancel out noise as well as the sound quality is great don love that you have to plug in the usb wire so they light up 
0,upon opening this speaker noticed it comes in very nice box the speaker seems durable and sounds amazing when it works right only had this for days used it the st day worked great come the rd day not so much it will play but cut out intermittently during songs speaker stays on it just literally stops when it wants to and plays when it wants to figure got lemon so ll try another might suggest don bother talking with support they will drive you insane just replace and move on 
1,besides driver totally dropping my package on my door step and watched him act like he didn tthis speaker is great the only thing wish it had like the jbl flip is its own sperate volume instead relying off just solely the phones volume this is great for hr shift
1,i absolutely loved this mouse it worked great the battery lasted for days and it fit my hand so well only giving it low rating because after month and three days it quit working it will not turn on anymore

1,this product is very good for noise cancellation and is long lasting very recommended
1,love the product bought for my microsoft surface pro and it works perfectly
1,using this for my work laptop receieved afternoon friday and used for little bit and pleased put up laptop for the weekend went to use it today monday and non responsive tried everything and still not working this thing is junk 
0,i loved it at first but the mouse started making squeaking noise when used the roller it was very annoying in class 
0,bought this around months ago the advertised range of feet is just not true have the dongle around feet away and the keyboard randomly stops registering keystrokes have to bring the keyboard close to the dongle for it to re register and then sit back down on the couch this might be battery related but then there is no visual indicator of battery levels today though it just completely stopped working doesnt register any keystrokes the keyboard is very light which is nice 
1, minutes in game and already impressed lightweight comfortable and surround sound bought these to use for my ps and when you swing melee weapon you can literally hear it move from one side of the screen to the other 
1,ive been looking for nice keyboard for my custom built gaming school home use pc and am more than pleased with this keyboard input lag is comparable to my logitech wired keyboard and ive played titanfall with it and love it battery life seems great as ive used this product all night and its still going strong the keys are great not quite as ratifying as clicky mechanical keyboard but very close the backlighting is beautiful the colors are clear and sharp but not overwhelmingly bright the shape key travel and spacing make this keyboard an absolute pleasure to work play with its lightweight but sturdy as you would actually have to put alot of force into bending or twisting the board to hurt it personally im certain that it would take alot of high drops onto concrete to actually hurt this thing all in all great product for great price and stoked to have it ive actually typed this review with the keyboard 
0,bought this in the beginning of august and it already doesn work don waste your money 
0,don buy died as soon as the return period is over can get refund for it
0,meh it speaker it mono speaker and not an overly good one for bass for loudness think for should be getting something bit awesome had an anker speaker that is similar in regards to output

1,great for gaming 
0,doesn work at all am tired of charging it and nothing happens wasted my money 
1,i really like this mouse super easy to connect and the charge lasts forever swear charge it once every weeks and leave it on by accident all the time but the sleep mode is great recommend 
0,worked well but dropped it off my desk on accident and it broke and no longer works 
1,the mouse was shipped fast and the packaging was in good condition the pairing was fast and easy spent on razer mouse with the same functions and lighting it broke in six months very happy with my purchase 
0,not enough lighting modes effects
0,i ordered this in early june and really enjoyed the fun color and sleek design however now in late july about months later first the usb transmitter broke off and got stuck in my laptop and then the mouse itself stopped charging and no longer works guess you get what you pay for look elsewhere 
0,loved the product at first actually bought two after couple weeks they quit charging and now they no longer work 
1,for cheap rechargeable mouse this is great 
1,we tested several similar speakers and this by far has the best overall sound with great bass extremely happy 
1,the sound quality is pretty good could not turn up volume past about halfway without getting distortion and bass was bottoming battery is great too much mid range little large and heavy no handles or convenient way to carry like the sound of my old bose mini sound link slightly better but will not get as loud of course 
1,awesome keyboard for gaming at this price
1,my year old loves them so far 
1,this is specifically for the green and black bengoo professional gaming headset the quality of this headset for the price is near unbeatable headset feels very durable kid proof it made of abs plastic with metal inserts on the adjustable band the ear cushions on these are pleather pillow cushions and they are extremely comfortable have an absolutely huge head and these fit just right the ear cups fit over my ears entirely and they do decent job of blocking out ambient sound the headset is very light weight making it very comfortable to use for long play sessions had no ear or head pain from wearing these for extended periods of time the integrated volume control and mute switch work very well the cord is extra long ft and it braided the entire way this cord feels pretty premium and even has velcro cord wrap on it it comes with pc splitter just in case you have setup like that the usb only powers the led lights and they are very green therefore the usb does not have to be plugged in but is nice touch if you re into that sort of thing personally really like the lights and think they are nice but don use them every time either microphone quality is very good and the noise canceling system seems to work extremely well on it only time echo was noticed was when volume was at and even then it was not bad at all went through numerous headsets in the last three weeks trying to find microphone that didn echo all my friends voices back at the slightest sound of speech seriously it was pathetic how garbage the microphones are on the expensive hyper and nacon rig headsets sound quality is superb for the price point these are pretty bass heavy if you like that sort of thing very reminiscent of skullcandy sound quality like this type of sound myself because in shooter you literally feel the bass with this headset highs are also good if not little less pronounced and had no problem hearing footsteps in shooters in games like fortnite that exactly what you want these also sound very well with directional audio like dolby atmos so definitely recommend these for surround sound gaming as well my one minor complaint is that the cord for the usb is not long enough and it did not come with an extender that small price to pay though considering everything else is so good about these headphones now own multiple bengoo products this is brand trust in not only are they quality brand but their customer service is absolutely excellent wouldn hesitate to buy this brand for any of your audio needs 
0,have to bang mouse to get it to wake up 
0,its great my only complaint is that it doesn warn you if the battery is low
1,i bought this and tried it for several months this still works fine for both sound and mic performance is also good for the price my kids love this so bought another one 
1,great sound
0,keys light up very brite 
1,i admit the placement of the enter key is little weird but otherwise it great keyboard don use it for gaming it just my wireless keyboard use for remote work at home have long nails and consequently my typing can be really noisy so love how quiet the keys are on this keyboard after month battery life is really good so far and the colors are pretty 
0,this was really good mouse quiet clicks very lightweight and it moved smoothly over my mouse pad it fell opened up bit was able to put it clip it back in but after the third fall the ball stopped working but for the price it def worth it long battery life think charged like middle of every other week and used it from weekdays for about hours 
1,bought these after my kids broke my sony gold headset while these do not have as great features at the gold headsets as don offer as well sound quality and noise cancellation while also being wireless expected step down in quality as was purchasing something to bare the damage they might face until my kids and cats could learn to mind others things while they are step down surprised at how much like them like the volume control on the cord rather than the headset so can see if it if need to and while not as great they do have some noise cancellation there isn much base nor any surround sound features but for this price point think that would be asking for too much overall happy with them and until feel the need to get more expensive pair these will be what use will definitely hold onto them as backup pair if ever do upgrade as well 
1,they love them use them all time
0,barely had it months and the scroll wheel on top stopped working now it pretty much useless 
0,is dead will not hold charge cheap but not worth what paid 
1,i would recommend to anyone if you play ps or this is just the best and great item
1,this little speaker has great sound we use it by the pool all the time while we haven dropped it in the water it has gotten splashed and has been fine two years later and the battery still lasts hours 
0,unresponisve and choppy movement clicks fail to register horrible experience with gaming rgb looks bad all around avoid 
1,perfect all around btooth speaker 
1,i had been looking for gaming headset for my ps casual gamer and was looking for something that could use when play late at night read the reviews for this product and convinced me to buy when received it was surprised how big the headphones are but it wasn big deal when tried them on they felt comfortable and have been using them for long period of time and my ears have not gotten tired the sound quality is surprisingly good with good bass and can hear the surround sound effects of my games the voice chat quality is very good with clear quality in terms of noise cancellation it not true noise cancellation can still hear sounds form outside when playing but it minimal overall pleased with these headphones as they do their job just fine 
1,very nice mouse love the size and feel
0,keyboard works okay except the key continues to get stuck as soon as started using it and needs to be picked at to lift it back into place and messes up my work lot the space bar is much louder than the rest of the keys which is more of an annoyance than anything 
0,stopped working for no apparent reason

0,all around the product is bad bought it as christmas gift and the user can not speak to other people he can hear them fine the mic is turned on the settings on the console allow for chatting and he even reset the console to factory default beware of the cheap price tag as this is cheap product 
0,i bought this headset months ago and from day one it has weird staticky noise now you can hear from it at all this product sucks never buying anything from them again waist of money 
1,i very surprised by this speaker did lot of research ahead of time and decided on this one as it highly regarded ve heard several different bt speakers and none sounded this good extremely satisfied with the bass output it best if used few feet away from you as it sounds better had it outside last night during rainstorm it was basically getting misted on for hours but no ill effects you will not be dissatisfied 
0,i hated this item they described how easy it was to use and received mine and it does not connect after doing my research on it its suppose to be compatible with my laptop and its not so now have to order different one im very disappointed in this product 
1,i love this keyboard the keys are super quiet and it comfortable to type on it great having the colors as opposed to simple white backlight only have two issues first do with the colors were tad bit brighter second would like way say downloadable software to control the brightness as well as how fast the colors fade or not at all even and lastly how long before sleep mode kicks in for the price though you definitely can complain and frankly feel my issues are very minor 
1,the mouse performs just like it states perfect design smooth scrolling and quality product 
1,lasted exactly months then stopped working properly really loved the feel and accuracy when it worked but would expect better quality wouldn scroll and became jerky 
1,used them all summer in stereo operation with the jbl app works well sounds great 
0,you can hardly maneuver the clicker with this mouse it doesn do its main function the led is ok guess but what the point of mouse that doesn do it job guess have new flashlight give stars if could don waste your time or money on this 
1,i like how compact it is and it has good bass
1,great mouse definitely got my money worth
1,kiddo loved these for his pc games he is it was great deal and got great reviews bought these on month later and only one ear piece works and the mic doesn work anymore either can even return them now because the return window closed literally days ago not impressed 
1,i purchased the jbl charge because of reviews had also purchased ue megaboom not the newer megaboom the two were equally priced so it came down to sound and features the jbl allows for charging device and for using plug in direct jack instead of bluetooth thought those were more important when ordered it until listened to them side by side had listeners and switched back and forth between them using same songs the other listeners liked the megaboom better but couldn identify why found the megaboom to have tighter bass and much better transparent mids and highs the charge sounded muddy in lows mids highs in comparison alone it can sound okay as long as you don have competitive reference sound quality beat out battery charging and the aux input 
1,my husband absolutely loves it and the quality of the sound he takes it to work in vacation and outside when he is working in the back excellent value 
1,super cute works great love the rainbow lights however it takes while to charge and the charge does not last long at all don even bother to use it anymore because it not even worth the hassle 
0,this keyboard stopped working terrible keyboard doesnt do all the function it shows to it description avoid this product way overpriced and klim support is also terrible too 
1,these headphones are so cool they re going to go perfect with the gaming mouse love these because they re good they work so good the best headphones ve ever had 
1,great sound and very durable 
0,bought two pairs of these for the kids and they are holding up nice so far 
1,my son absolutely loves them and uses it with his ps no complaints with the audio and he seems to like the fit 
1,i had gotten these headphones for my son for when he is on the playstation or his laptop and he enjoys it very much he has not found dislike to the headphones since getting them they came in quality condition and are excellent this product deserves stars because of how amazing these headphones are 
0,it disconnects at times requiring you to unplug the usb connection and reconnect 
1,it good for it price and actually came with audio splitter which was nice 
1,top of the line speaker at great price would absolutely buy again 
0,exactly what thought it was gonna be use this at work and although the sleep mode can be annoying it does it job 
1,i was super exited for this to come and it worked for about five minuted the only thing that worked was the usb to type adapter 
0,do not buy keyboard went dead hours after returnability date 
1,i love this no more batteries and love how it lights up 
0,i liked this mouse until it broke two days outside of the return window the roller for the scroll function broke while was scrolling was nothing but gentle with this mouse and it only lasted days it is nice looking the colored lights are not obnoxious and it is very quiet 
0,for you are better off getting wired mouse this thing is so bad the sensor light bleeds through the top shell of the mouse worse is that the actual functionality is very poor if your are looking for an accurate mouse this is not it have multi colored mouse pad and the sensor struggles between the change in shades making this mouse difficult to use if you have plain color mouse pad this may be acceptable but if your on the go this will not do 
0,the charge has one speaker in the front left side the charge had two speakers and assumed the would keep this design the sound quality is fine but the build of the speaker is misleading 
1,they show in pics like they are lit not with nintendo switch has separate port to plug in which required me to add cord with adapter super annoying would not have purchased 
1,i am pleasantly surprised by this mouse don use them in general often but ended up buying one because my laptop doesn love to let me use the keypad and wasd while gaming without delaying one or the other slightly wasn necessarily expecting transitioning to using mouse to be easy but it really has been it has no lag while gaming at all is very smooth gliding doesn hurt my wrists at all and holds charge for long time have forgotten to turn it off several times and gone back to use it few days later and it was still plenty charged enough for couple of hours of gameplay highly recommended 
0,this is really great mouse it works as designed unfortunately don have the patience for the very slow response time it was aggravating waiting for it to respond to my finger commands needless to say got rid of it and bought something different 
0,i was looking for this mouse for my new samsung galaxy tab have really good and soft clic you don have to worry about the battery if you need wireless mouse this one is for you highly recommend this one

0,cute but base too loud 
1,this is our nd one the size sound ease of use durability and quality are outstanding 
1,very happy with item all of our teens have this speaker and they all love them
0,i purchased this item for my office so could play some background music while work work better with some low background music the speaker is great the only issue ve had is the speaker took forever to charge and after while the battery wouldn charge all the way read online that if you have this problem you need to try using different charging cord and charging plug so bought new charging plug and cord it worked and now the speaker charges just fine the charging cord that comes with the speaker may not be strong enough and you may need another charging cord and plug 
1,i did so much research and ended up with this model and could not be happier the sound quality is amazing and it could get so loud it could fill up the whole downstairs if wanted got the white color and it looks so good 
1,you dont hear any clicking like normal mouses which is nice the color is good and smooth as well my only complaint is you have to move it back and forth sometimes to wake it up rather than that its perfect mouse when its awake 
1,so got this in the mail and immediately started using it it worked great in the beginning super quiet and the color change is cool but after week or two was using it and it just stopped working it would turn on but wouldn work on my laptop and it was the only computer have used it on can barely get it to move on the screen and then it just shuts off but it really was great when first got it 
1,love it 
1,my laptop doesn have light up keys and prop it higher so don put strain on my neck this wireless laptop came at great price and is made in america 
1,great product
1,very satisfying to use and look at but after couple months the scroll wheel started being super rough and squeaky good value though 
1,really nice rat would definitely recommend it feels great rechargeable cool led colors and wireless 
1,i liked using this mouse but it needed charged lot more than anticipated it looks good and worked good but overall was little too cheaply made and it didn last long it fell thanks to my small children and cracked right open only got to use it couple of months 
0,really bummed these seem like really nice headphones but the mic doesn work you can hear fine in them but no one can hear you 
1,easy setup and small for travel great product 
0,if you can spend the extra money and buy something little better quality
1,i just needed wireless mouse for at work because was sick of the cord the company issued mouse had the color is bright and the lights are nice subtle change to working they re pretty the only thing hate is that have to bounce it on the mousepad to wake it up nothing major but the sensor could be better it not overwhelmingly wonderful but it cute and is good value considering the cost 
0,i bought this mouse in june month later the wheel stopped working like the gold color and the smoothness of it but the wheel is something that would consistently need to use 
1,i ve been wanting mouse for while and glad purchased this one use it to game and edit my videos and it really comes in handy it better than than track pad and any other mouse in my opinion

1,this product is perfect super affordable and works like charm no issues at all plus the color way is almost perfect match great buy 
1,loved the change of lights and the fell under my hand great mouse 
1,the major flaw with the mouse for me is that the battery life is almost nonexistent it lasts only about hours for me guessing the one got may be defective because need to have this plugged in all the time to make it usable but can work that way not factoring in the battery everything else is great in comparison to other mice in this price range 
1,headset is comfortable on the ears with great sound quality and great mic people can hear me with perfectly recommend it low price with great quality 
0,in this price range these headphones are top notch replaced my former pair same brand with these and have no complaints 
0,great product no issues
0,started out pretty nice but after weeks the mouse no longer tracks properly even after charging all night after about minutes of use the cursor refuses to respond to the mouse movements update the vendor keeps sending me emails asking me to delete this review for guessing they don want me to write this on the review but ve told them no three times now and they just sent another one ve told them that it unethical ve told them its completely against the spirit of reviews in the first place and there another one in my inbox sigh guess just forward another one to the customer service department of amazon 
1,this mouse is amazing it is ergonomic cheap and functional defenitly great choice for business for games don have an opinion cause don play computer games 
1,great headphones got this headset for my new remote work at home position on the phone with clients for many hours at time ear buds were hurting my ears and trying to talk through the computer speaker was making it hard to hear clients and vice versa this head set wore for hours straight and never got headache and my ears didn hurt clients voices were clear there also volume control wheel on the cord of the headset itself which has been extremely useful for switching between quiet caller and then loud caller 
0,they are your typical average gaming headset so they work well and are worth the money paid for them my only complaint is that the microphone is not very adjustable and have to speak very loudly for people to hear me sometimes 
0,was little squirrely to use
1,very good mouse excellent
1,great little speaker for outside we take this speaker with us to the beach and camping the sound is decent and love how rugged it is is plus don have to worry about leaving it out in the rain know that there are speakers out there with better sound but the price of them is also lot higher as for camper and beach life this will do just fine for me

0,works well does what it supposed to do
0,good headset for gaming 
1,these lasted just long enough for the return window to close the sound quality and everything about them were actually great while it lasted the first thing to go was the mic guessing it was fine at first then my teammates started to say hey your mic is garbage it sounds terrible mute your mic then after the mic started going the end of the plug is now slipping out of the jack all the time and the sound from the speakers almost is starting to sound clipping if these lasted year or so would say great buy but they didn they lasted like month or less

1,bought this for my teenage son to use for his ps gaming he has used sony gold headsets and turtle beach higher end sets and says these are an very good for the price they seem to be an excellent value this is being rated stars not that they are as good or better than the others mentioned but for the value vs quality of sound hopefully they will last decent while to truly earn the star rating gave it stars but if they don last for at least months that will be revised 
0,charge only lasts short time then stops typing plug it in and stops typing when charged tested on other systems and nothing changed
0,it only worked for month do not recommend 
1,at first thought it wasn going to be as good because of the price too cheap and honestly surprised the audio is pretty good better than what expected the cancelation noise is awesome can almost hear myself you can unmute and mute also lower and raise the volume which think it awesome overall better than excepted and the price is very good for what you get

1,this is nice sleek little mouse very pleased with the size and the connection range was looking for one that wasn too clunky but still looked decent this definitely fits the bill all the awesome colors is just plus for my own personal amusement also if you don want the lights all the time there is setting for that too good little mouse for the price

1,purchased this as gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it he takes it everywhere while he working and the battery life is great definitely good purchase 
0,the keyboard feels great looks great but it not nearly special enough for how often it needs to be plugged in it has died on me in the worst situations never any sort of warning and happens roughly once every weeks would much rather have hardwired or battery operated keyboard than this battery life is frankly unacceptable
0,worked fine for month now it doesn hold charge and if wanted it to work need to tape the charger into very specific spot cheaply made piece of crap
0,only used few times and the left click broke might want to select different one
0,my only concern is the volume adjustment does not work in small enough increments 
1,works well for xbox good quality sound style is nice fits perfect for large heads 
1,mouse is nice thought there was an option to not have it light up since don need that function but the options are off one color and alternating many colors it only lights up while you are moving it and the light is off when its still glides good clicks well my only really issue with it is the scroller wheel can be little unreliable if want to scroll down just line or two it won move and then if scroll just little faster it zooms down the page overall decent
1,i obsessed with this speaker not only is it the perfect size but also didn have to compromise the quality of volume or sound it gets so loud and it still clear have recommended this speaker to lots of my friends also the grey is such good color love it 
0,this lags so bad not great
0,i don see where they get hour battery life thing didn even give me hours good sound quality though

0,good headset
1,sounds great looks great 
1,works great in laptop very aesthetically pleasing ready to use and install
0,the good thing is this mouse is cheap but it feels like it too the wheel is terrible and the buttons are not even or flush and when moving from the wheel to the buttons your finger catches on the button other than feeling really cheaply made it functions as it should
0,bought it on august th and it died april th it was good keyboard up till now not one problem then this morning it just quit yes its charged 
0,the mouse is fine but the scroll button started squeaking almost immediately and is pretty annoying 
1,i ve tried other jbl bluetooth speakers in past years to be clear ve tried many dozens listened for hours tested usually reviewed and ve kept the ones that think have something special good sound thought after few more generations jbl may have figured out how to nail together decent thing was wrong buy bose soundlink mini listen to it figure out how to do better than that it has half the volume of this thing and sounds indisputably bigger better jbl don cry bose also completely beefed it with their own new generation revolve speakers they had spectacular speakers in the soundlink iii and especially the brilliant and nonpareil soundlink mini and decided to make the awful revolve speakers they may get notch louder and sound like muddy garbage but it round and that makes it better for parties congratulations we ve discovered idiocracy sony is even worse leading the charge into irrelevance starting with the srs and improving it by making the srs xb great bass for speaker its size if only great sound was produced by bass alone it doesn produce any midranges or treble speakers by idiots for idiots anyway jbl has never made great bluetooth speaker so suppose th generation speaker that still sucks isn really giving anything up just want the world to know that this speaker just ain great there better richer more articulate deep and mid bass in the bose soundlink mini at half the size it not waterproof and suppose people who need speakers with round cabinets probably also need to listen to music around pools most of the time and can figure out any effective way to prevent their speakers from falling in so maybe the jbl is great for certain type of person 
0,i read the reviews and ordered two one for home one for office they both worked great for about weeks started having trouble with the charge not lasting and then by the time my return window expired they were both worthless can still plug in and the lights are pretty perhaps very weak night light that is what the star is for the pretty lights 
1,developers really did number with this device this mouse speaks for itself it is actually just what the marketing team indicated awesome am customizable type of consumer thus enjoy my share of intriguing components that of which deviates from the mundane norm this led mouse wowed me with the illuminating colorful lighting and the smoothness upon usage very well crafted and look forward to purchasing other colors as time progress

0,the roller on top of the mouse quits working or falls down in the mouse the colors and lights are fun but the mouse itself is defective have had at this point and will not buy another 
0,while these headphones offer great value would recommend them to anyone but gamers this is annoying while gaming because they are very loose and gets you distracted even after putting it on tight most setting it undoes the setting have rather average sized head 
0,originally liked the idea of not having to use batteries tried using this mouse for about week when finished using it forgot to plug it in so the next time tried to use it the power was zapped that pretty much defeats the purpose of having cordless mouse with no power had to use it when plugged into my laptop sent it back and got mouse that requires on battery

1,i bought this for my son to play fortnite on his switch works so well borrowed it for work one day and my coworkers even commented on how clear sounded 
0,everything bad sound is wack
0,the keyboard is definitely quiet but the enter key is in an awkward position if you learned how to type and don hunt and peck you will constantly be hitting the slash key rather than the enter key this gets very frustrating when trying to type reports and documents it has nice look and my kids thought it was cool with the colors but sadly it was returned due to it not being practical for my needs

0,don waste your money on this mine stop working within the first month of having it

0,coming from the logitech series headphones the bengoo headphones are more than adequate for gaming loud and crisp comfy only down side is the mic portion is not bendy like the mic closer to my face 
1,sounds lot better than wanderboom that gave away to my dad got this instead and think it way better 
0,works great but the mic was kinda flimsy 
1,it didn work properly and didn fit well on my head too big and bulky 
0,i thought had to keep charging this work hour days and it hasn died on me yet charged it time in week 
1,works great in the dark brightness and colors are fantastic and the battery life seems to last for days also the kick back from the keys makes typing breeze ll be looking for more products from klim 
1,i really love how easy it is to setup this mouse nothing to download just plug and play have been looking for slim mouse that works on my mac and windows machine that doesn need batteries or mousepad and this definitely fits the bill the lights are cute fun addition but are subtle enough to not be distraction while using and don seem to drain the battery too much overall think it great for anyone looking for something easy to use 
1,i have one and my grandson has one and we love it the sound is great it is easy to take places 
0,decent speaker way better upgrade than my other ihome speaker the ihome speaker lasted me about years and still works so let see how long this one will last 
0,my mouse never worked charged it the first day for the recommended time when tried to use it it powered on briefly and then powered completely off thought it must not have charged completely so charged it again and again and again each time it did the same thing just threw it away never even got to use it 
1,i only got around hours on full charge but this was using the bluetooth and at max volume for such small device the sound is better than expected 
0,real light weight easy to use connects quickly
1,got it for family member they have been very happy with the keyboard battery life could last longer but is still good for night of gaming keyboard works while charging if you need to play for the full day and the on off switch really helps save power when you take break one problem to not is that keyboard remains on while changing even if you switch it off this is minor problem but could be larger issues for others 
1,this headset has immaculate quality the array of colors is really good the options on the dial of the headset is what sold me for sure 
1,you get what you pay for what did expect just save and buy an actual headset like from corsair or some turtle beaches are better than these 
1,i bought for my son and he loves it compact and portable 
0,it was made of cheaper plastic then expected and refused to charge after it ran out after the first time wasn enough money to make it worth my time trying to return it the color change was cool was it lasted

0,terrible product does not work well glitches causes cursor to makes sudden unintended changes in direction without in use would not recommend
0,i ve had of these randomly stop working in the last year both stopped clicking after minimal use less than days on the first one less than for the second don understand why this product is so highly rated it terrible learn from my mistakes 
1,battery life is great was on all day full hrs came back next day played again all day then plug it in over night didn want it to go down during the day so that super compared to my bose speaker barely ran hrs volume levels are huge vary lowed on high setting and again much better then my bose speaker will be coming back for another one of these they connect to each other for multi room function also the blue tooth connectivity is great can go any were in the house with my phone and it does not loose connection or get broken up and again this is better speaker than my bose hands down out of my last several speakers this one is the best 
0,this mouse was amazing two weeks after received the mouse it went nuts if you move right it goes down left it goes up does not work right it takes more time to figure out what it is doing than actually functioning worst mouse ever 
1,soft click it light weight cute lights love it 
1,great speaker good to very good sound quality charges phone quickly and it charges quickly as well am having replacement sent though due to only one speaker really sending out music the other is dull and crackled 
0,good sound quality
0,i did not like that it made very faint squealing noise the colors are pretty and the clicks are quiet but everytime the mouse moves you can hair high pitch noise the instructions were all in foreign language as well
0,left control key doesnt work for some use cases for whatever reason so it annoying to have to use the right control key also no fn lock long story short looks good but crappy functionality pick another keyboard
1,love this mouse it lives up to its description 
0,bought two and both died after week
1,i was little apprehensive about buying this keyboard at first because didn want anything shaped too gamey or angular guess you could say but was too impatient to wait another hours for different style to ship out so jumped on this one and don even notice the shape anymore at all love this keyboard the keys are not completely silent but almost the perfect amount of soft clickiness just enough to let you know you ve hit key the colors are vibrant and so fun even in broad daylight so far battery life is great love that you can charge and still use it at the same time some won allow this the only thing ll have to get used to is the enter return key is about an inch farther to the right than used to but that matters less to me every day very happy 
1,great customer service tho
1,loud bass and vibrant audio quality
0,this product works as described 
0,looks good and has reasonable weight 
0,for gaming
1,great mouse very fast and smooth was skeptical at the price being so cheap but wow fantastic item would definitely buy again in fact am getting second one for my son for school 
0,brought for work and very satisfied
0,when first got this item it worked fine but after couple of weeks it was not moving the arrow very well dropped it once and it stopped working altogether

1,won hold charge
1,cool item easy to set up very pretty 
0,good headset for the price 
1,i love the lights and the easy set up 
1,good quality sounds great 
0,worked for couple months doesn anymore
0,the usb port broke inside my work laptop after only using this wireless mouse for days there was nothing that happened that would have should have caused the usb to break other than it being poorly made am very disappointed with the outcome 
0,unfortunately it been months and now it useless and unresponsive going to have to get rid of it now and get new one guess you get what you pay for 
1,i have purchased several of these headsets over the years they are great quality and sound amazing they even withstand teenage boys highly recommend 
0,looked cool cancels sound ok but def hard to hear xbox or tablet laptop audio at full volume and also def not good for game chat or work calls on laptop for both parties
1,works great my son really likes it 
1,i originally bought this mouse for my gaming pc and it works great it smooth and easy to use without wire would also recommend people get pretty big mouse pad so you have room to move it makes everything better
1, ive had for about year and only used it on occasion it worked pretty good until started using it on regular basis mouse slowly stopped working more and more until now it doesn track any movement at all do not buy unless you want to throw away
0,i don even use it full shift and already broke very disappointed 
0,when bought this wireless keyboard was expecting to be able to use my keyboard from my couch which is probably about away from my computer max can get more than about feet away before this terrible dongle starts to lose connection am using the same usb extender had my xbox one controller dongle on so it was as far from the rest of my equipment as could make it with direct line of site to my klim keyboard and still dropped the connection completely after about feet this is definitely only an okay keyboard if you are sitting at desk right next to your computer but needless to say very disappointed 
0,nothing
1,i ordered these as gift for my son he uses them with both his nintendo and xbox for gaming with friends no problems so far the have good sound quality and the price was very reasonable 
1,after using it for couple hours on its initial charge plugged it in using the given charging cable but it would never charge plugged it in to my computer the wall and with different usb charger and nothing worked cannot recommend anyone to purchase this product when it does not charge properly if it worked would have given it star review because it looks nice has rgb and had very little latency despite being wireless do not buy this product 
1,batteries would be so much easier with the way the power runs out after charging by usb frustrating because if your in the middle of something have to go back to old mouse until this mouse is ready to use love the feel of it though and the cool lights 
0, for usd you can go wrong 
1,i had bluetooth speaker for years and it finally died so needed to find replacement after careful research and debate decided on this model it looks slightly small but it packs punch used it the first weekend after arrival at campsite the site was booming with music and was astonished at the quality the speaker also lasted full days of almost constant use definitely my new camping speaker added bonus is you can charge phones via the speaker overall love the quality of this device my only gripe is it could be little bassier 
0,this product came fast and has worked well
1,if you re looking for an inexpensive basic mouse this one is great the colors add an extra fun flair 
1, first of all the price of this speaker is cheap for the quality sound that your getting this speaker sounds amazing the build quality is great and the fact that is waterproof and you can charge your phone from it is an added bonus so happy got it the only downside to me and this is just me being picky and annoying is that can see the battery percentage on my iphone but it does show it on the bottom of the speakers with little led dots get this speaker you wont regret it 
0,the cord is stupid it like its backwards only way to use the lights is plug the cord in and the cord for the lighst is literally foot long that means you are foot in front of the tv when you play game ridiculous
1,i love this mouse and can wait to get another one just like it use this one at work and it very comfortable and not loud clicking either 
1,works and sounds great
1,love it
0,i knew it was too good to be true this would be great mouse but it just stopped working after week have charged it few times prior no issues went to use it today and nothing would avoid and spend few more bucks on something not as cheaply made 
0,i love the light weight fee to this mouse but unfortunately it doesn hold charge to be able to use it 
1,this is headset at best not what expected question the reviews 
0,i would buy it against it pretty not really bling just sleek 
0,i used for mins and it stopped working the lights were on my pc detected the dongle but mouse didn work initiated the return
0,sucks that buys you keyboard that just dies after couple weeks know this only happens to some people that buy the product so if you wanna roll the dice go ahead

0,another lowest bidder production
1,great product wonderful sound and noise cancellation 
1,it works perfect with ps controller great value 
1,it sleek and there no clicking noise when pressing mouse buttons the optional lights on the mouse also helps me when studying at night will definitely buy more of these and recommend to my work staff excellent product at great price good job
1,i bought it to keep it at work and everyone loves it the sound quality is great and it gets very loud bass can be adjusted 
1,i got tired of using my laptop keyboard and decided rj invest love the led colors with the mouse although rarely change the settings love that don have to switch batteries and all have to do plug it in could tell after about week including me leaving my mouse on few times that it was time for charge my mouse began to lag and went ahead and plugged it up also the color of the mouse matches with the picture well
0,some people will hate and say these are bad headphones cuz they re cheap ve been using these forever their sound quality is great and the mic quality is just as good as any other mix no need to spend hundreds on mic and headphones when you can get it for cheap 
1,great product for gaming at great price
0,sensitive mouse maybe because it new works fine
0,i unboxed it plugged it into my laptop after charging it and it would not even connect to my computer at all completely dissatisfied with my time and money with this product if you re looking for mouse this isn it 
1,honestly this product is super good especially for the price my brother has his own pair of gaming headphones they are different brand that cost about would say that this for lot cheaper sounds better and fits better than his if you needed one real fast would say buying this would be good option that what did was having problems in class with my mic so had to buy new headphones and this did the job 
1,this was great find for me have an ergonomic computer desk that raises to standing as needed the keyboard drawer is not wide and other keyboards hung out the back and front this one fits fine and still feels like as it is regular keyboard like the indicator lights caps numlock etc are well lit when on and the technicolor backlighting is nice to see and let me know everything is working 
0,this keyboard is ass dont buy it please so many typos from bad connectivity less than month in and it cant even hold charge now complete waste of money if we humor it not breaking so quickly the auto off feature of seconds of inactivity horrible and cant be disabled this is bad product in lot of ways
1,i really upset about this had gotten this as gift and it stopped working on the rd month had it it won charge anymore purchased few charger cords and still won charge now ima just have to purchase new one from somewhere else because not gona take it in somewhere to get fixed and pay the same amount to fix it like paid to buy this speaker 
0,can just say wow this mouse is absolutely incredible the wireless feature and led lights make this thing steal for its price it is super helpful when want to stay in bed but still use my pc from afar can just pull this bad boy out and start going it has silent clicks to it as well so you wont be waking or bothering anybody buy using this mouse and with its low profile shape and structure it takes up practically no room whatsoever 
0,not only does this feel like the cheapest mouse have ever had the displeasure of holding the usb type adapter is loose fitting piece of junk not even worth the hassle of returning this piece of garbage only flashes red for second then quits doing anything else even after being charged for hours have attached it to different devices and nothing guess you get what you pay for and this instance junk
0,i bought this on october and it stopped working on april it started acting up on the th where the responsiveness was sketchy charged it that night and the next day it didn power up 
0,it just stopped working out of nowhere mad missed my return date 
1,i bought this product in november by december the axle for the mouse wheel had snapped ll admit liked the size and look of it enough to buy it again here we are in february and the same exact thing has happened again used this mouse for my work computer in the office and certainly don aggressively use the scroll wheel yet the same axle has snapped on two of these units both within the first weeks of use ve never had mouse break apart like this before so have to conclude that this is just utterly cheap in the way it is made and the parts holding it together suppose you get what you pay for shame because aesthetically it is very nice will never buy this product again would advise anyone else to save your money and stay away pay few extra dollars and find something that lasts more than few weeks side note look forward to having the seller reach out to me to take down my review rolls eyes perhaps ll just copy and paste their request here for the rest of you to read ha
0,quit working trashed it
1,first ever gaming headset and it awesome fits comfortably and is great for talking and listening 
1,i bought these back in may it is now october and they re dead they were great good sound good mic then they just up and died well past my return window of course that what get for trying to save money 
1,i love it would recommend 
1,i don normally like using mouse when am on my laptop but they built in keys on my laptop were starting to go so decided to purchase mouse when looking for mouse wanted something sleek and able to take with me to school and back it fits my hand perfectly and enjoy how sleek it looks the only thing that would change is being able to decide the color and color patterns other than that it was worth the purchase 
0,good sound quality for beginners
1,it worked great it would get little slow when it needed charging but all of sudden it won come on even after charging 
1,pros games sound nice and loud without any distortion cheap but good great first time gaming head set comfortable even when playing for four or more hours cons no noise canceling large and somewhat cumbersome cord is long and thick so if you have it plugged into ps or ps controller it is annoyingly in the way usb connector for the led lights is also annoying not even sure what the lights are for anyway you can see them when wearing the headset unless you play in front of mirrior good cheap entry level headset my first one it is comfortable and lightweight but feels reasonably sturdy sound is nice an loud crisp but not lot of bass would definitely recommend for the casual gamer like myself microphone is omnidirectional and pretty sensitive so keep that in mind if you are playing in noisy environment 
1,i bought the jbl speaker may and have listened to it daily for hours the sound out of the box was waaay heavy on the base found sound mix app online and used the app to adjust the bass down for more realistic range it sounds good now for the impressive part perched it on the top of my shower enclosure listening to my fav pandora station when you guessed it the speaker dropped feet to the shower pan bounced good foot and landed getting drenched it was amazing never missed beat but it gets better didn learn from that experience and did the same thing again ops second foot fall bounced did four degree flips in the shower and keep on playing will definitely buy another one when destroy this one jbl sounds great and indestructible chris
0,it is so pretty the lights are gorgeous love that it is rechargeable but the roller in the middle broke and haven even had it for months use it for work so it doesn get lot of use either 
1,like our other jbl products it performs well 
0,stopped working after months trash
0,after using this as an everyday keyboard for six months now there are few problems with even with full charge the keyboard will randomly power off have missed keystrokes and there no way to tell how much charge is left in the battery it is quiet however but wouldn use it as an everyday keyboard 
0,sound could be bit higher in quality 
1,my year old son loves this headset he just received it for his birthday we haven texted all of the features and aren sure if the mic works yet but he still enjoying it update mic works and he very happy with the gift 
1,easy to set up connect happy with this product
0,the on off switch often feels like there is sand in the mouse when moving it it not smooth move like would have expected like the mouse but that roughness is annoying at times 
1,it fine keyboard for the amount paid but it doesn work as well as some other wireless keyboards the charge didn seem to hold too long for mine feel like have to charge it often also needed it to be on my craft table which is not too far from my computer but the distance can use it wirelessly is poor needed it to allow me to work farther from my computer but couldn go as far as wanted 
1,great bass at low volume way louder than my ue boom good buy 
1,so far this has been an impressive speaker use by the pool in the garage on patio anytime we want some music outside the battery hasn dropped below two lights out of have used for up to hours and recharged an iphone from to and still had three lights on the time got it to lights when had it playing close to hours on and off outside the bass is good when you are short distance away and the volume moderately high when you are right next to it the bass response is little odd with the bass expander or resonators sounding little rubbery once you get little distance it sounds great especially next to structures it makes the bass sound better bluetooth range is fantastic easily feet outdoors with no obstructions also the splash proof features makes it safe for the splash zone next to pool in the garage it really good while working bt connects within seconds recommend 
1,exactly as described works great fir my chromebook 
0,this was horrible purchase am returning this because it sucked 
0,after connected this mouse whole mechanism fxxxxx up 
1,great product for great price 
1,the microphone is too short so if you have big head the people ur talking to won be able to hear you 
0,not great quality but it works fine lights up
0,i would give it no stars if could 
0,when got this mouse noticed rattling sound when it was plugged up saw that there was piece broken and rattling around on the inside the lights don look good at all returned it 
1,works great charges up after about an hour for couple days use great mouse 
1,good quality for good price 
1, original review for this price they re pretty good they aren noise cancelling but around the speakers in the headphones are great the microphone isn great though was told sounded like was speaking into plastic cup within the first two weeks the headphones no longer light up and the mic doesn work customer service never returns any emails even though ve sent to them very disappointed will never buy from these people again 
0,this product is crap do not buy opened fresh out of the box and immediately had trouble lightweight and cheap feeling does not slide particularly well although sleek it isn the most ergonomic thing but worst of all after plugging in and turning on the mouse will work normally for around secs if you leave it idle for longer than that the response becomes choppy and the mouse essentially stops working tried on multiple devices to no avail do not buy in most cases id say you get what you pay for but here it feels like even less than that 
0,at first really loved this mouse fast connection and worked well but like several other reviews mentioned after about months it just stopped working it didn charge or anything it just literally stopped working for that alone would rate it bad pedi to because it doesn last didn drop it or beak it it simply stopped working 
1,i brought these headphones because my turtle beaches randomly just broke and when say these are just amazing you can hear everything it shuts out everything and looks pretty good if you ask me
0,i ve had this for few weeks and it already useless it won charge when connected horrible 
0,long lasting battery good sound quality always connects to bluetooth 
0,long lasting power recharges fast
1,the title of my post says lot also like how lightweight it is it very responsive to movement but not overly so it as good wireless mouse as ve ever had 
0,i like everything about this product
0,loudest speaker ve had to date and not very big or heavy so it easy to throw in bag and take with you where ever you go 
0,i made the mistake of reading the reviews only after bought the mouse because it had stars with something like reviews so thought it was fine saw few reviews that said the seller tried to bribe them into removing their review that made me really regret buying from such an unethical business don think you should buy this mouse even if you re on budget there much better quality mice out there for even less money than this costs this mouse is very cheaply made as for performance issues for one it way too thin and lightweight when using it it very easy to knock it out of place and click something by mistake because it not heavy enough or grippy enough on the bottom to stay where you put it ve never had this issue with mouse before the tracking sensor is also way too sensitive the cursor still moves when you lift the mouse decent couple centimeters above the surface it on this also makes it very hard to put the cursor where you want it on the screen because it still tracking movement when you lift it up the cord to charge it is pretty short although that not huge issue just sort of disappointing the biggest issue is that the cord does not seem to fit properly into the port on the mouse and takes bit of manhandling it felt like was going to break some of the cheap thin plastic when first plugged it in as for looks the edges where the paint or whatever it is on the top are pretty rough and it even came with some of the paint chipped off bought the light pink mouse it not nearly as light as it is in the pictures it darker and much warmer toned rather than cool light pink like the picture it also not as reflective as the pictures show but that not huge deal you can turn off the rgb lights by the switch on the bottom if you want but it still emits red light when using it wish it didn do that it ugly and probably wastes more power 
1,there amazing spent on pair that is half as good as this
0,looks cool doesn last 
0,use for two weeks then it stop working tried charging it and everything 
1,i use these solely for gaming and they work well easy to plug and play on pc or console ps xbone 
1,for the money this mouse is great value needed new mouse as the click on my old brand name mouse was begging to miss wanted something fairly inexpensive wireless and rechargeable am tired of having to switch out batteries this mouse fit all those perfectly my first month impression is it excellent after the initial charge it still going strong with maybe an hour day usage after weeks it goes to sleep after period of inactivity which helps to conserve the battery my only gripe would be the slim profile think prefer little more bulk in my palm my only contact with the mouse when navigating is with my fingers no palm contact this does not deduct from my rating as it is clearly advertised as slim profile design all in am glad purchased this mouse if this company develops full contoured model would surely upgrade 
0,never buy this product when buy something usually look at product reviews but this product seems to have lot of problems unlike reviews don usually post reviews but posting this product review in hopes that there won be victims like me bought mouse and it worked fine at first but after charging it it started to get weird and didn work at all so thought there might be small problem so exchanged the new one instead of refund received new mouse and it worked fine for another few days but after charging it again it didn work the product user manual says it is sensitive to charging but this is serious problem bought this product for the convenience of not using the battery or wire but think it makes no sense to not work because of the charging prolem 
1,pretty good
1,i in small space so this thing is really loud which is great lots of bass also great not so much if you re looking for quality highs and such really happy about this purchase unless you re music sound quality critic you ll be happy too 
0,the mouse broke couple days after the return window reached out and heard nothing back not fun throwing money away like that 
0,stagnant mouse movement dont buy this if you use your mouse often 
1,i am an adult with smaller head and sometimes feel like these headphones are slipping off when gaming but that is really the only complaint have tend to just use one of my beanies to keep it from slipping don like the cutesy headphones they make for smaller heads that why chose this one otherwise like these headphones alot 
1,good mouse for my laptop great feel and comfortable 
1,the headset is very high quality and the price is actually cheap so you will get an amazing headset for few bucks this headset is light weight and has very good quality sound for the price and is very comfortable microphone works good as well lights on the sides of the headset make it look nice this product is very good very happy with the purchase 
1,light weight fits hand perfectly
0,bought for my son to use with his xbox one only to find out it requires adaptor to even work for the buy wireless version and end up with better product 
0,this mouse was bad quality 
0,lasted about week
1,so far they work great great price 
0,but the item jul months didnt chrage it more than times yet the charger broke its nice but wont last
0,i charged the mouse for over hours and never even charged it doesn even work turn it on and it blinks red have already started return waste of time and money 
1,i like the size of this speaker and quality of sound it also holds charge so well pleased with the pricing for great product we bluetooth from our phone enjoy streamed music for hours 
0,good sound if keep it on too long it hurts my ears might be too small for my giant ears
0,i was very excited about this keyboard but unfortunately it has been very bad experience in general it is as presented in the advertisement but after using it for minutes it stops working completely even when it is turned on tried reinstalling the drivers changing the usb port and trying it with another computer but did not get good results it does not work after few minutes am very disappointed that wasted my money on this product 
1,he loved iy
0,i used this mouse once after this use it died so was going to charge it up figuring didn give it enough time to charge tried different times and it wouldn charge at all so decided to just go back to my old mouse tried to remove the usb and the metal part broke off and stayed inside my laptop so had to remove it and there was no fixing it so disappointed in the quality of this mouse 
1,the speaker is easy to set up and use it produces good sound at an attractive price 
0,the scroll wheel stopped working after weeks 
0,i ve been through two of these mice the first one lasted only one day before the scroll wheel stopped working opted for an exchange but the new one had the same issue after about weeks looking through reviews it seems to be common issue returning this for another brand 
0,i like the look and feel of this mouse it is clean and fits my hand well my complaint is with the working of it after only months the scroll wheel has quit working about weeks ago it began with the cursor jumping when pulled down on the wheel but now it only barely works pull down on the wheel and either nothing happens at all or the line on the page jumps down one line and then stops altogether will see if can get it fixed or replaced but this was new item and should have worked year or more without issues it makes me very sad 
1,i absolutely loved my speaker the sound of my music gets me pumped when doing work so definitely recommend it
0,this product doesn hurt my ears like most headphones 
1,i had an issue with the original usb cord not working contacted customer support and they provided extremely generous resolutions the battery lasted me month without changing would absolutely buy from the company again
0,great sound no issues here ve had them for about two months and use them everyday 
1,ive been huge fan of the charge series since the charge owning every speaker in between then and now this speaker was seriously very minor upgrade if not downgrade from the charge tbh the sound quality is still there personally prefer the sound of the charge over this one think due to the having drivers and this one having single slightly bigger driver the seems to be alittle more bass heavy surprisingly since its slightly smaller over all youre still getting the jbl signature sound it still sounds great still think its worth stars waterproof abilities are amazing and the battery life is totally better the battery on the charge seemed to poop out on me but only after like years which wasnt to hard to fix maybe the number of the speaker is the life expectancy tune in next time to find out on stephens reviews 
0,never worked returned
1,awesome sound and bass 
0,the scroll wheel doesn work
0,mouse seems to work ok looks nice easy install etc biggest complaint is the time out and wake up feature every time go to use the pc it asleep then have to either click button which may may not cause an action on the pc or pick it up and down several times too annoying so stopped using it might keep it aside for use with my laptop when traveling definitely not for daily use 
1,i love this for going to the beach or just hanging out in my back yard it has great sound and gave few as gifts 
1,i admit was going to return this item because did not understand the little usb attachment was on the bottom of the device had charged it but was using the little black usb insert in my laptop which did not work once inserted the white short usb from underneath the pointer my computer accepted it and it works great am still learning how to use these devices at age it is gorgeous and works 
1,mine worked at first but now it just lights up when attempt to type doesn register the keys and doesn work for gaming like had hoped ordered little over month ago and it barely works really sad about my purchase and would recommend buying higher quality keyboard 
0,i would not recommend this mouse as it feels like the plastic will break on you at any second it very cheaply made and the light shines through the top layer of plastic which makes it look way worse 
1,my grandson wanted this for his birthday and he was very happy with it
0,i really liked the color and look of the mouse but the scroll never worked even after fully charging it 
0,stopped working nd north of work

1,love the sound 
1,great product
1,i just got this keyboard for my stepdad as was building him new pc ended up opening and using it to complete the install of software like the size and feel it pretty light but doesn feel cheap buttons feel good quiet but good tactile feel haven played with color modes yet it charges pretty quick haven used it enough to say how long it lasts not deal breaker but be aware you still need to plug the dongle into usb port to use this keyboard even if you have it plugged into another usb port with the charging cable otherwise seems decent 
1,works well very responsive
1,yo this keyboard is just simply awesome one of the coolest keyboards ever owned hands down love the feel of each button on the keyboard love the color scheme of the led lights can even see some of the led lights like mixing with each other which just find totally cool the fact that this keyboard is wireless is just plus for me it is for sure not too overly clicky like other keyboards had in the past this one is more subtle but as well excellent to the touch guarantee your satisfaction with this keyboard and without doubt recommend it to anyone wanting new keyboard that is wireless or that is purchasing for the first time 
0,doesn work after less than days of having it
1,i was little worried about battery life based on some of the other reviews am not gamer have an office job but on my computer probably hours day and used my mouse extensively single charge lasts me days you can also use the mouse when you are charging have usb port on my keyboard that use per my attached picture as you can see the charging cable is pretty short so some might need to extend the cord but overall am very happy with this mouse 
0,i use it for gaming have no problem with it 
1,love this mouse it so pretty to look at and it does the job 
0,bought it in september stopped working after few days they sent me replacement now it february and it totally died so sad use it at work 
0,the charge doesn last very long so basically its wired mouse cuz its charging all the time so disappointing 
1,seems like good mouse so far good feel nice weight 
0,they re uncomfortable and seem really fragile the cord looks sturdy in the photo but is actually somewhat flimsy they re not noise canceling either tried them as soon as got them and it was big disappointing
0,terrible product first mouse broke within week second mouse broke within months 
1,gets loud enough to hear outside in the yard crisp sound great sound 
0,this is the most inconsistent keyboard ever it worked fine for the first months but now it only seems to work when it wants to that terrible for gaming you ll be in game and out of nowhere your character is taking damage and you re like what the hell ive had this for about months and its already failing on me can recommend this 
0,purchased may th and usb broke apart by july th save your money 
0,if you forget this speak on your car and it flys off at mph it will survive takes lickin and keeps on ticking 
0,it works it sometimes works you never know waste 
1,very beautiful and easy to use but came apart after few months of using
0,purchased in july and it worked until february when it failed to pair with my macbook pro repeated attempts to resolve issue using all available tech support including jbl tech support failures all note that this item has year warranty after much time energy expended jbl harman sent me new refurbished charge mid may same story it failed to pair after repeated attempts requested refund denied if you buy this item from amazon or any other rd seller you will not get refund if you must have this speaker buy direct from jbl harmon but please dont bother if you are amac owner run away quickly from this dud 
0,i wish could adjust the sleeping mode timing 
0,i used this mouse once and it died after an hour was on the charger literally over night now can even get it to charge at all waste of my money 
1,havent really had time to really try them out but have worked great so far on one game
1,great product for gaming
0,the mouse had no issues working with my windows over all so nice and silence lovet
0,the mouse functions well however after few days noticed that the multicolor lights no longer changes hope to find some way to fix it 
1,i don like how you can change the keycaps also don like how you have to click the middle of the space bar and can just click the side
1,it was fine until it just stopped working months in do yourself favor and spend little more money to get well known brand like logitech 
0,this mouse worked well for about months then it stopped holding charge even tethered to the laptop it was not working well but why buy wireless mouse if it needs to be used wired and why use wired mouse if it doesn even work don waste your money ll go pull out my ancient wired mouse that works 
1,at first glance the keyboard looks and feels nice the keys are decently silent though very loud compared to my other low profile minimalistic keyboard and the rgb is cool however there are several design flaws that make it very annoying to use the function key is on the right side of the spacebar which is non standard so very weird to use keyboard shortcuts like ctrl shift for dev tools in chrome am programmer only works on the right side of the keyboard not the left which used to and works on every other keyboard ve ever used and the issue cannot be fixed with the klim reset keyboard combo so you re stuck with the issue the rgb is somewhat faint and even on the static setting doesn stay on it dims after not very long at all of inactivity making me have to constantly type to keep it onoverall would save your money you could get much better keyboard for the same price that doesn have the glitches or annoyances honestly surprised this keyboard has so many good reviews and that klim continues to sell known defective product without offering returns what sham 
1,buy buy buy it its so quiet so soft and so comfortable its easy to travel with and connectivity is great battery life is amazing 
1,i really needed mouse because it is so much easier when working from my laptop searched on amazon and came across this vibrant mouse fell in love and decided to buy it it was the best decision because this mouse is fantastic and works perfectly love the color variations and the sleek look it is easy to setup use and also easy to charge it is also wireless which makes it even better

1,perfect fit

0,no one can hear my partner through the microphone we ve tried on his ps phone and laptop 
1,can believe use to waste my money buying cheap portable speakers this one is great its loud bass sounds amazing and with hours of battery life can throw away my portable charger 
0,the first day received the product it worked very well though couldn get seem to get it to charge it had enough juice to get through the first day so wasn too concerned by the second day though something had happened to the optical portion because moving the mouse often wouldn move the cursor and never moved it as fast as it should the buttons all seem to work fine still but without the ability to actually move the mouse as want to it pretty useless

0,horrible just horrible
1,person this was bought for love it 
1,totally shocked at how clear sounding it is it definitely gets loud was very impressed with the life of battery however now know why it last if you are not playing anything after awhile it automatically shuts itself off kind of nice feature we like it because of the bluetooth and use it while driving in our rv we have an older motorhome and it doesn have fancy radio with gps or bluetooth so this portable speaker works great however using gps google maps from phone is nice but while traveling it may only speak an hour later well the speaker will shut itself off if nothing comes through in an hour so to fix that we just listen to sirius via bluetooth by phone and when google gps needs to give directions it just cuts through music to announce what ever so it works out great 
1,garbage bought my niece new hp for college plugging the usb in laptop mouse cause the laptop not to work mouse moves really slow or don move at all thinking it was the laptop took the laptop back got brand new one same issue but when took the ian out and used my store bough best buy mouse works perfect no problems be careful with this mouse and plugging it into your laptops 
1,this worked fine but you can change the lighting but after about week of use it shut off and is dead even after charging every night batteries won charge lights won come on checked the battery with volt meter and it shows volts it won charge 
0,really like it

0,good response
0,horrible quality the wheel stopped working only after few hours it is very light and feels very cheap 
0,the usb dongle broke for the mouse and is now completely useless wish the seller sold replacements so can use my mouse again 
0,the kids really love them the fact that they are waterproof is essential don know enough features so can detail that but am considering getting one for myself 
0, month update this thing squeals now it took me week to figure out why kept hearing high pitched whine every time moved my cursor and eventually realized that something inside the mouse is creating very high pitched squeal every time move it that on top of the mouse dying in about day of use now means that this thing is no go definitely buy something else this thing has been total headache since got it the battery on this mouse doesn seem to last very long time after about two days of usage it ll die find myself plugging it in every night to make sure don have to deal with that additionally the thing goes to sleep after about minute or two without movement super annoying you have to click the mouse to wake it up again and doing so registers click wherever your mouse was left on screen before it went to sleep can recommend it for any type of work that requires small periods of typing or reading you ll end up waking up the mouse from its weird sleep about million times 
0,i bought this brand for the conveniance of using adapter provided with the product for usb the adapter is so loose it falls off tried in different computers that has usb csame problem have days to return let me check how long the battery holds good before charge 
1,love this mouse
1,works great 
0,very nice
0,rich sound adequate bass and midrange its heavier the smaller portable sound devices have owned but don have to worry about battery life we take this to the beach and will take it kayaking too 
0,really good
0, light pink quiet when click smooth across my mouse pad and does not get stuck led lights change often all as advertised from my concern 
1,battery takes forever to die which is great sleep mode helps lot it thinner and smoother than any other mouse ve own love the lights 
0,i bought this after my xiberia headset broke and was blown away by how much of downgrade it was might actually tape up the xiberia to use it instead of this the sound quality on these is bad there are weird whining noises in the earpiece whenever people talk to me it has separate usb port which thought would be nice but its only purpose is to turn on the lights no joke this is waste of spend bit more and get pair of xiberias here instead 
1,great product
0,i bought one for my laptop and days after got it the wheel stopped working and could hear something loose inside it returned it for replacement the new one seems to be working fine although sometimes the cursor glides smoothly across the screen and other times it jumps around lot maybe this is just something wireless mice do don know ve never had one before 
1,when my year old wired mouse finally died started looking at replacement options have never liked wireless mice due to the constant need for batteries and finding some in the office or while traveling is always huge pain finding out that there are rechargeable options out there was game changer so far after about two weeks of use love feel of the mouse the pointer speed which is adjustable and well the fact that just plug it in to charge while the receiver is usb and comes with an adapter for usb the charging port on the mouse is micro usb the charging cable that comes with is usb to micro usb inches incase you want longer one like did one thing though do have small hands so the size is perfect someone with small to medium sized hands will like the feel and size of the mouse if you have large hands it may feel to small all in all liked it so much ordered nd one for my work laptop bag to replace the wired mouse that travel with 
0,just got the headset havent used it yet
1,great purchage very satified
1,i use this mouse for work it didn require any weird setup like downloading software it super comfy and has sleep mode that activates after about minutes click of the button wakes it up and it ready to go don regularly use the light up mode but it is cool feature that is fun to show off have carpal tunnel and it so much better on my wrist than standard wired computer mouse most definitely worth the purchase 
0,first months was nice but after that they do not work anymore 
0,the volume on this is lower than my flip big disappointment 
0,battery doesn last long and sleep mode is annoying so tossed it without warning it will just quit on you going back to battery brand 
0,i purchased this mouse for my chromebook which only has mousepad enjoy that it really lights up it is lightweight and an easy glide finish it wireless and rechargable the wireless adapter fits in the bottom of the mouse so you don lose it 
1,this is great prouduct works as good as beats
0,very frustrating as they both broke on the same day about month after purchase and too late to return 
1,lightweight mouse easy to charge can use while charging and like the teal color got with fun colors lighting up makes my office work and time at the computer feel little less boring easy to connect and works well with imac 
1,bought this for my kiddos laptop she likes the lights and the almost weightless feeling it was good buy for the price and works great so far 
1,i ve loved this mouse since bought the first one will continue to use it
0,works as mouse should work 
1,came charged has an off on and then the color switch quiet quick my favorite mode is that when it idle for while it shuts down and you just click and it comes back to life exactly what wanted easy usb charge hope it lasts me for while 
1,awesome headset very sleek style and the noise canceling is amazing 
1,good sound exactly like pictured little pricey 
1,this baby is great works perfect with my macbook pro and love that it rechargeable 
1,decent speaker nothing revelatory but the form factor is great it gets the noise out there effectively pros battery life feels like it infinite bluetooth connectivity is the best ve ever experienced handsome unit cons thuddy sound but some of that is bluetooth some of that is streaming some of that is the fact that it not very big overall effectively fills the sonic gap between my home speakers and my laptop which is what it was meant for 
0,the mouse works fine but was disappointed that the color did not match my macbook as it shows 
1,it slim not bulky works well with my laptop love the lights great buy
0, outta 
1,great mouse when it works sleek design good performance six week after got it it stopped working it is just few days past the product return deadline have written to the manufacturer lets wait what happens

1,my hand doesn cramp using it win update wheel in mouse won scroll sadness
1,i love this speaker the battery lasts for days and days can use this for at least six hrs day for days before have to charge it never had an issue connecting with bluetooth to my laptop phone or tv it little larger than my old jbl but that fine don travel with it too often and when do it fits neatly into backpack 
1,these are great value with very good sound they are not jbl but do have very clear sound 
0,so just got these today and was excited however upon setting them up noticed that the light up function is only usable when hooking up the attached usb to the port on my ps stupidly enough there isn enough cable split to also connect the headphones to your controller in order to use the headphones for its sole purpose it either they light up on the damn counter and look cute or you talk to friends while playing online but there is no both so can you say complete design flaw false advertisement and bottom line this company needs to close shop and go flip burgers 
1,great for the price
0,the mouse is not chargeable don recommend buying it 
0,very bad advertising in the process of sending this back as it doesn work with xbox one 
1,bought this for my husband and he loved it the lighting is bold clear and the keys are soft to the touch easy installation he was gaming in no time

1,i was super excited for this mouse its so sleek and small it was perfect for me unfortunately it doesn work all that well its super glitchy especially when you turn it on color mode it lags and sometimes it doesn even click on what you re trying to click on its much easier to just use my mouse pad on my computer 
0,i purchased this item for macbookpro but it does not work as promised tried to return but dhl will charge me usd and amazon only cover usd so resigne to return
0,mic stopped working and tried contacting the company and two weeks have gone by and no response would not recommend purchasing 
0,i bought this as just quick way to navigate my tablet in hurry the sleep mode is perfect since don use it but now and then when hear an alert just tap to wake up and click no need to keep re syncing and the charge has lasted long time tiny but not too tiny 
0,i had different models was time for new one since going out town ship was fast but the thing would not stay connected to any phone for music or call sent back and had to go purchase from store and pay little more but no issues and sounds great sent back got refund for broken one understand that not seller fault they can test new equipment and not all will function out box correctly so for the hassle gave stars
1,my son loves the headset we ve ordered several before but this headset has the right hookup for xbox one great sound quality too 
1,i loved these headphones until they abruptly stopped working after months know that sounds like long time kind of however haven used them that often and they are stored properly 
1,excellent quality you expect from jbl 
1,this is great headset for the price it does what need it to do
0,cheap for reason doesnt work after months guess that is why the return policy is just days do not waste your time on this item complete garbage 
1,my daughter uses these for remote schooling as well as video chatting with her friends playing video games and listening to music she loves them and the price is perfect 
1,first one received only lasted one week but the return process was quick do really like the second one mainly because of the lights know shallow right 
1,i like the fact that it turns off after some time like that it works with usb and like that can use it with my mac or my pc and like the charging cable 
1,awesome product good sound and appearance as to be expected
0,all did was turn the mic and out of nowhere it just broke off
0,this mouse is unusable for someone who wishes to work efficiently it tracks completely erratically and is simply not worth using 
1,after looking at the reviews of this particular led mouse decided to give it try received it and so far am very pleased with how it performs it is extremely lightweight and the led lights make it so much more enjoyable to use highly recommended 
1,i use it plugged in as the battery life is ok but not amazing but does what it supposed to do great addition to my workspace and very comfortable on the hand
1,i am really disappointed with this keyboard at first it was great but within month or two the keyboard started to glitch certain buttons do not work when press them considering the price of the product was happy but not if it stops working after two months 
0,piece of junk doesn work probably why it on sale 
1,amazing speaker with even better connectivity only complaint is sound is not too crisp or loud overall amazing speaker and would recommend to buy 
1,i purchased this wireless mouse because needed one and cheap one was very impressed you don even need to use mousepad it works smoothly by itself 
1,love this mouse its lightweight and love that its usb charge great value for the price 
1,my daughter has one of these and when heard it was blown away awesome sound with deep bass it sounds best up to about of volume but even that is more than plenty of volume the battery is awesome lasting several days and you can charge your phone or ipad without reducing lot of battery life 
1,update have upped my review from to since reached out to the seller and they offered to send replacement usb dongle will update the review again once that has been received would have given this mouse five stars month ago but yesterday when removed the usb dongle from my laptop the thing fell apart in my hands and the mouse is now worthless tried to piece it back together but it won stay together it shame because this mouse is really cool looking feels nice in my hand and holds charge long time very disappointed 
0,the color and shape are very nice but the mouse and the packaging arrived very dirty the scroll wheel on the mouse is made from cheap rubbery silicone material and is completely crooked it also did not have good feel when testing it out not smooth and feels like it take lot of extra pressure to operate than others not sure if this is due to it being crooked or not but either way this will be returned 
0,stopped working less than hours after received the package it would cost me more to return it than what paid for it so it just sitting in my office making clutter honestly would not recommend it at all 
0,i got the product and tried to use it plugged it into the usb slot of my ps the light went on and turned the mute off and volume up the headset does not work at all can hear people talking from my television but not in the headset or the headset is not being picked up by the game or working strongly do not recommend as it doesn work 
0, while the product looks great it not very ergonomic for me noticed pain in my hands after only few days of usage not great for long period usage 
1,it jus dies really quick but mabye that cuz leave it on and walk away cuz when done using it like to walk back into my room with it still on but otherwise love it
0,i got this mouse for work it works great however it needs to be charged and unfortunately it can be used with battery it only usb charger so the only down side of this if work with it for days will need to charge it or it will die on and have to keep charging it in ur laptop to keep using it it unfortunately not for me and don like how it doesn have battery or dies fast 
0,it fills the bill not too expensive works fine 
0,amazing feels cheap but is very durable
0,it boom like crackhead hittin the pipe 
1,this is great speaker with great battery life and great bluetooth connectivity to our samsung and chromebook and the jbl app does firmware updates over bluetooth love it the reason for losing one star is its charging behavior bought this to have it in one location constantly connected to charger and to only carry it around from time to time running on battery for some reason the speaker charges fully the leds indicating the battery level go out to indicate that it fully charged but then after some time the leds turn on again and the th led starts blinking to indicate that it charging and stays that way all this while the speaker sits there connected to the charger without being turned on the leds are very bright which makes it more annoying 
1,this speaker is super durable have dropped it multiple time and it works just fine and it is super loud recommend this speaker
1,i have purchased of these for my kids now borrow them all the time when sitting out by the pool or going to the beach great sound quality and very simple to set up highly recommend 
0,husband needed new headset got this for his birthday and he was shocked it was affordable because he said the quality during conversation with teammates were comparable to his expensive turtle beach headset if not better recommend 
1,got for my husband he loves it
1,great headphones to replace those expensive astro as
1,i work at place that supplies cheap basic keyboards and splurged to make my workday better with something that makes me happy how did they let you order that mine is crap etc bought it with my own money to make me smile with the rainbow at my finger tips muhaha love it 
1,i got the pink one love it 
1,love my new speaker sound is great and easy to set up 
0,ergonomically find it to be too short and bit uncomfortable bought it as travel mouse so could over look that except that it barely works every time have tried to use it it eventually gets super laggy and almost impossible to use turning it off and on again fixes it but only until it starts to lag again 
1,love the back lighting just wish they could stay on 
1,good sound quality really enjoy this bluetooth speaker 
1,this is made with low quality the adapter for usb doesn work as in it doesn even fit into usb port tried multiple to make sure this was the common denominator the mouse comes apart too easily the battery life is poor do not waste your money buying 
0,this mouse is very cheaply made and did not function properly right out of the box it will move the cursor around and scroll but it will not click on anything right or left click ridiculous want to return it but the hassle of dealing with it isn worth getting the money back since it was so cheap to begin with should have known to go for more expensive and reputable brand like logitech 
0,all sound etc good
0,the product is not worth the price because the keys are too big the lights are dimmed and it felt poorly made in general although it worked correctly would spend money elsewhere
0,not well made very light and flimsy returned it 
1,this mouse is great quality and duration is excellent this mouse goes uncharged for months while being university student realize recently it have been giving little problem hopefully the seller can assist with this great but otherwise
1,i had to buy two different mice within months the scroll button stopped working on both devices other than that okay product led light function is cool sleek style and easily rechargeable 
0,it worked for min and then got stuck in my laptop looks like made of cheap material
0,worked great till the roller broke used times 
0,i dont dislike nothing of it
1,i bought this for my year old for gaming was shocked at how good the sound quality is and the noise cancelling features also very comfortable to wear for long periods 
1,overall comfortable headset with sensitive omni directional mic bit too sensitive at times great price point and aesthetic 
0,i bought this for my husband for his birthday gift week before his birthday then gave it to him on his birthday and weeks later it starts acting up and showing fully charged and only playing for an hour or before dying this item states that it plays for hours when fully charged which is false call amazon and since it was few days out of the day period for return had to go to jbl for manufacturer warranty they send you label and said it would take days to determine if it is really defective for them to send replacement am not at all happy with this product totally not worth the money have had my bose soundlink for years and still sounds great and plays for long time will not recommend this product 
1,i really like the slim size it fits into ravel bag nicely love that it can be turned off for travel and not have to remove the battery the colorful lights are nice touch 
1,awesome speaker loud as you want it to go we use it outside and it an amazing little guy get it wet keeps on going
1,quite and really easy to use 
0, 
1,got these headphones for gaming absolutely love them 
0,the thing broke on me in two months the jbl is sending me new one what pain in the ass
0,my son was using it for his laptop for school and it stopped working didn want to work nomore 
1,great sound my family loves it 
0,it did not come with usb cable to charge the mouse wasted my money 
1,decent good volume and long battery life and little bigger and better then the flips the charge feature is ok guess but drains the battery quickly other then that it last long and loud great little speaker glad have it
0,comfy looks cool
0,the battery wont fully charge and takes day to charge when it should only take hours the charging system dosent work and it disconnects random sometimes while watching movie ive only had it for month and used it very little very disappointed 
1,great sound 
1,lasts long on initial charge perfect size 
0,this keyboard has short battery life and doesn give any sort of indication that the battery is low till it stops working then when you charge it it doesn let you know when its done it also doesn seem to like any alt or windows key related shortcuts from the left side only the right
1,comfortable sound clear and looks nice
0,the second we plug the mic into the xbox controller the controller turns off when we take it out the controller turns back on tried it with all of our controllers bogus do not buy 
0,product was easy to set up however only lasted month charging port broke after weeks and was not able to get it to charge few weeks after that 
1,cute and comfy but the volume does not go up too high high enough for most gameplay but play games where need the extra volume at times
0,these do not cover the ears well and therefore let in lots of sound from the outside am coming from an old pair of hyperx headphones they were great other than not having an online volume these bengoo units are absolutely horrible head is throbbing within minutes of wearing 
0,the keyboard looks and feels great but the issue is that at times while typing or using any keys really it just stops responding for good while this has lead me to charge it until the indicator turns off fully charged and it still does this ve turned off the wireless and connected via usb and this still happens so ultimately would not recommend this because you kinda need to use all the keys at all times 
0,i dont usually give feedback but this one has to be my worst purchase in long time despite of all the positive reviews got my keyboard in november many times have got letters being typed double few days ago the keyboard just stopped working no more lights no more signal and no more life that keyboard went straight to the trash can 
1,i have small head but that isn anyone fault it just doesn fit well even on the smallest setting the ear pieces rest too low which probably wouldn be big issue but have glasses as well and it presses to hard on my glasses just think they could have designed it with more flex in the size expansion thingies is all otherwise its good 
1,i had high hopes for this jbl charge it good name brand with good reviews gave it shot but couldn get used the the mono sound and the fact there no equalizer my ears just weren happy the bluetooth worked great it solid and connected every time with no issues battery life seems good though haven kept it long enough to actually confirm this am returning it and keeping the soundcore motion boom which purchased week later as comparison it stereo sound far more superior and can be paired with an equalizer phone app therefore the charge is going back 
0,didn work after days
1,its great
0,pc mice ve purchased in the past lasted years not months caution purchase of this mouse for tha reason 
1,working great no problem
0,initially charged this mouse overnight and then used it for two eight hour days turning it off overnight couple hours into using it on day it died charged it for several hours and it has no juice and won even turn on would think after couple hours of charging it would at least turn on 
0,good
1,i love this mouse it works perfectly and not all that tech savvy
1,love my led light up mouse it very quiet and no more clicking noise yay thanks amazon
0,product looks great but it came broke and box was destroyed should have sent it another box instead of soft package
1,the good looks nice and feels good in your hand the bad the right click button is too sensitive constantly opening up the right click menu the pointer freezes and have to turn the mouse off and on to unfreeze it the ugly ordered silver mouse and got dark gray 
0,i had similar mouse that lasted two years this one died after only month would work after charging for few minutes and then stopped 
0,do not drop the mouse on the floor very sensitive and broke right away after having it for year so this is the second one ordered works very well and has cute colors 
1,works great 
1,not sure why people are not giving this all stars this sound on this thing is wild and that fact that it waterproof is amazing love it 
1,for the price realized could have gotten something lot better it cheaply made glitches even with full charge got the white one and wish would have read the reviews before hand because it does indeed show the whole internal lighting unit which just adds the the cheapness of it it does the job still all considering just think it value is overestimated 
1,it looks good feels good but won hold charge for even minutes 
1,works like it should and it super easy to set up 
1,very nice headphone perfect for gaming
1,i got these for my son to use for his switch and he loves them like that you can control the volume on them and turn the mic on and off they also cancel lot of the background noise so it is easier for you to concentrate and hear the game 
1,great headset ve paid much more for headsets in the past that weren as well made 
1,my son loves this keyboard
1,love the color and the sound and ability to talk with ease as game 
0,work very slow
0,unboxed this today and couldn listen for more than an hour muted sound no treble just overloaded with bass removing the extra bass with the bluetooth volume reduction buttons combo to produce flat sound didn help jbl hk should invest in an eq app asap to allow users increase the higher frequencies to produce their preferred output balance can even live with just preset eq settings but not this jbl didn listen to all the charge criticisms about sound quality very disappointing packaging back up to return total waste of time
1,easy to travel with and use great fun 
0,good sound quality not as much noise cancellation
0,this mouse only worked for weeks then it died very disappointed
1,love it would recommend works great love that it light and can hear when you click the mouse lights are very cute
0,within week of my son using it the scroll button broke somehow it outside the return window so now we are stuck with it 
1,mouse works fine and the grandkids love them they mainly use them for school work and for gaming 
1,excellent sound great bass and treble but it doesn seem possible to change any equalizer settings every time the speaker is turned on off it makes rather loud noise it pleasant just kind of loud 
1,got this as gift he loved it 
0,although this mouse is nice and worked well for work it is not meant for extensive use after exactly one month this mouse no longer works in addition this coincides with the return window closing literally yesterday 
1,i didn find this easy to use 
1,i got this for my daughter and she loves it they seem to be very durable she very rough on them 
1,what can say this is hands down the best waterproof portable bluetooth speaker ve ever owned and ve had few jbl has household name for reason and rightly so the sound is amazing especially the bass great range and even better battery life the fact that you can charge your device from it is awesome but the link feature has to be my favorite aspect link with your friends who have the same family of speakers with one button for multi source audio ve got few friends with them and it always enhances the experience also more than one device can pair simultaneously which is super neat highly recommended 
1,great product love the long battery life 
0,this speaker does not hold its charge and to top it off you can use it while charging have an anker speaker that was much cheaper and it actually works better had purchased the jlb for fathers day thinking it would be an upgrade for my husband but was proven wrong if the return window was still open would return it 
1,cordless mouse is okay out of the box after few months of use it starting to wear out now have to start double clicking to make sure it responds to the icons click on colors are still great it great not having to change batteries it pretty much quite as far as clicking but as noted above it will still wear out sooner than expected 
1,this mouse is very light weight and the added colors make it super cool it also holds charge for very long time which is helpful really great product for the price 
0,it works but within reason this review is relative to what you re looking to get out of the speaker for myself it not loud enough and as the battery levels deplete so does the quality and volume of sound 
1,i bought this for my daughter for christmas she listens to it for hours daily easy to connect long lasting battery cute color 
1,idk if would say this is great mouse for gaming but it great for the price and very smooth different setting are great too flip the lights on and it like rave in your hand 
1,love the headset works great and does the job would definitely recommend to buy for all gaming and headset needs
1,this headset it looks so pretty love the color along the pink light when plugged in however bought this headset for my work from home job meaning need the mic performed mic test and discovered that the mic doesn work disabled the built in mic on my hp pc to ensure sound was coming solely from the headset mic heard low scratchy version of my voice gave stars bc music sounds great in the headphones and it feels high quality returning them bc the mic is about inches of trash 
1,it is ergonomic and love the color it works well and is pretty quiet when clicking and scrolling 
0,qwerty
0,this mouse is quiet when clicking as described
0,stopped working and wouldn re charge after few weeks threw it away 
1,we luv it use it at the beach on house hold jobs great sound 
0,i like everything about it
1,works great very reactive colors look fantastic while they go through all the different colors as well as has an option for just red if you re not feeling fancy
1,colors are just ok have to position the charger certain way for it to actually charge 
1,it does not work at all cvharges itight goes on then all of sudden turns off and its like touching toy plastic like mouse its not worth the money
1,the mouse is so fast and good got the silver color and its so pretty especially at night easy set up
1,i didn know it was possible to like mouse so much it is very comfortable and smooth the battery life is pretty long don like having to charge it because sometimes forget to plug it in and then it goes dead the battery life usually last around week as long as can remember to charge it it is fantastic 
1,sharp looking headset with great sound very comfortable to wear 
1,i only have issues for this item the charging cord fell apart month after received it the mouse its self stopped working few months after receiving it after reaching out to the manufacturer who promised to replace the item which never received am forced to buy another mouse but definitely not from this manufacturer 
1,big loud very good dance to clear and audible music 
1,just hit but it is cheaply made should hv purchased from best buy vs this one 
0,is very easy to manager 
1,incredible it is so good you can mute yourself while gaming without going to settings and doing it 
0,the mouse will not charge and it feels cheaply made 
1,i don use this mouse often and the mouse has completely failed won turn on it does light up when it is charging but won turn on and stay on completely unusable pretty big bummer since past return do not recommend 
0,i think it kind of disconnects sometimes unless it just my laptop 
1, for the price it really amazing it just doesn light up how thought it would connected via just the headphone jack but overall it great want to get pink one as well
0,the usb plug in is not long enough to connect to the playstation the cord is so long but splits into two six inch cords one goes into the playstation the other goes into the controller what the hell are you supposed to do
0,you can hardly maneuver the clicker with this mouse it doesn do its main function the led is ok guess but what the point of mouse that doesn do it job guess have new flashlight give stars if could don waste your time or money on this 
1,i have having really hard time finding the right headphones and when he got these he won take them off they are great for all gaming systems he uses them for switch 
0,nice
1,the good easy plug and play connection keys are lit up real good and easy to see in the dark keys have nice feel to them and are relatively quiet so far battery charge lasts the whole day of pretty solid gaming the bad user manual is kinda so so backlighting turns off kinda quickly and sure that can be adjusted but again the user manual is kinda so so 
1,love it use it in my side by side out on the patio or back yard
1,great sound and easy to use
0,it would meets my basic needs and the colors are dope wireless keyboard is necessary 
1,i like this speaker it really has terrific range paired it with my computer and took it all the way to the back of the house and around the corner and it still great my one big complaint if you re paying this kind of money for speaker they can include charging cord with it have to buy separate one really 
0,when its hot outside the heat makes it skip or it does something to it really wanted it mostly for outside disappointing that its not good in the outside summer months
0,when this gets low on battery it starts to flicker out where the mouse will stop and start sending information so your clicks won register and the mouse will stop moving across the screen the added problem is that it gets to this low battery point after about min to an hour of use and then it acts like that for the next several hours it nearly impossible to keep it charged up that long it shame because love how stylized it is but it basically unusable 
1,this headset is light weight and has very good quality sound for the price and is very comfortable microphone works good as well lights on the sides of the headset make it look nice 
1,great product for the price my son loves it
0,nice feel and looks nice but the scroll wheel works on and off making more advanced tasks difficult 
1,i liked the fact it was slim and liked the lights on it 
1,the quality of this headset is great for its price love it would totally recommend for anyone who loves shooting games 
1,battery won last unable to return since my return window close 
1,it is really quite except that the scroll button when you click it is really loud rgb is decent for the price but wish it was brighter overall its decent
1,overall very good headset for ps like that it doesn need any batteries or charging the mic is sensitive overall good quality recommended
0,this was originally star review and wasn very happy with these headphones but after working with customer service they really worked to make this right overall 
1,works perfectly for my macbook sleek design with cool lights would buy again
1,works great
1,i can still hear my ps thought the noise cancelation would have been better and the mic quality is little muffled but everything else is great
0,awful sound quality mic sounds worse then international phone call and they feel extremely uncomfortable and stuff returned immediately 
0,directions suck charger sucks pretty color
0,not great item for long term use could be more sturdy 
0,battery life is shorter than advertised on this speaker other than that it connects quickly through bluetooth and has full sound
0,sound is excellent don know really about the battery life yet has made it through two golf outings for total of hours of music without being recharged but doubt it will last much longer on one charge at volume not big fan of the base of the unit very small and rolls around easily
1,love it its way better then the beats pill 
0,jbl makes the best bt speakers hands down there no competition ll be buying another to pair them both
1,excellent product use it for my ps and switch no issues at all highly recommend 
0,only the mic worked it did not pay any audio or music and the mic sounded extremely staticky would not recommend they finally got back to me and are sending me new one so will increase the stars because of their customer service if the next one doesn work then ll go back down to lower store
0,not enough bass
1,an attractive high performing speaker that exceeded my expectations first the bad news did have difficulty at first pairing my phone with the speaker the included instructions were no help and would have liked to see bit more detail it just series of what look like comic book panels begrudgingly downloaded the jbl portable app found bit more information and was able to pair straight out of the box the sound is bit disappointing the speaker did not produce much bass and was really heavy in the upper midrange and high frequencies would highly recommend downloading an equalizer app on your music source device now the good news the equalizer made this speaker come alive volume for days and more bass that would have expected for speaker this size the fact that it can also charge your music source device is even more reason to select this speaker 
1,comfortable and awesome sound
1,this mouse has been great super quiet when you click and responds well when prompted the lights add nice touch and remind you to turn it off for the day 
0,look good
1,great sound in small and portable unit ez to operate use it more than either of my bose wave units or my techniques and harman kardon receiver 
1,the item is easy to work with but honestly got it because liked the led light feature however the mouse does not light up 
1,i don like the way its been sound when music is on it skip some small parts of the music it sounds like the fake once what like about is the style and how its super loud 
0,it comfy has decent volume and controls but doesn last full year 
0,i gave up my mouse for this new mouse because it didn work on the other laptop to make them happy it would just stop working ordered replacement on another review amazon refunded my money 
0,work
1, great design overall let see how long this mouse lasts me love that the noise clicking is very quiet also love the glossed turquoise color no problem connecting to the bluetooth on my computer 
1,i purchased this mouse as the wheel on my old one quit working loved the design and wanted another so ordered it and received it aug it is oct and the wheel just quick working again would recommend looking at different mouse if you prefer your scrolling feature 
1,not bad but hurts my ears after long gaming sessions
0,works fine with xbox
1,good value for the money sound quality is ok cord seems ridiculously long but perhaps it because it works on the pc too using for xbox comfortable to wear kind of big in size so if it for kid just know it may be enormous on them 
0,very good quality 
0,several years ago purchased pair of jbl charge speakers to use around our pool and was immediately in love would connect one to my phone and then link the pair and have nice even sound all across our pool the range was great the sound was great and the batteries lasted long time we eventually wore the batteries out and decided to replace them with pair of jbls latest charge speakers the charge the sound quality and other features are the same but the instability and sensitivity of the bluetooth connection and link feature are so bad they are unusable have to have my phone within feed of the speaker for the bluetooth to connect and they constantly cut out loose their connection to each other or pick up static it is so persistent we are not using them anymore deeply regret buying these speakers and wish would have spent less money to but the far superior charge speakers again if you plan to connect two or more speakers together stay away from these because they just don work 
1,it wireless but not bluetooth very misleading as it was recommended with the other mice that was total waste of money but fits nicely in your palm with small hands 
0,i only used it once until it was dead and then charged for hours it wouldn even turn on so in all the charging feature does not work it was cute mouse though but it doesn work 
1,slim in the hand and works great 
1,i purchased one of these about months ago for regular use found the sound quality to be very good owned an older jbl speaker that failed within months the warranty return was hassle so am pleased that this model has performed well prefer that tactile buttons as it makes it easier to find buttons in dark situation as well as while driving also like the usb connection the older jbl with micro usb port failed from wear and tear can no longer charge that one and repairing it is not cost effective the only demerit can say is this unit is bit heavy to carry around and listen to music it more for placing in static location do want to note the sound does tend to come from one side of the unit it not it also isn stereo speaker that means one driver with channels merged not important for me the phone app allows for creating stereo sound from individual units verified that purchased nd unit during the holiday sale and would recommend this speaker to good friend 
1,love the product will probably order another color 
1,slik nice color same as photos love it also its actually wireless and no need battery some still one aaa battery even if its says wirless bought so many of this to my whole family
1,first the left mouse click is not sensitive enough requiring longer press than usual for the mouse to register the click annoying and betting it will shorten the life of the mouse because you have to press harder longer another less significant annoyance make sure you don turn on the light feature it looks cool but the thing acts like lava light night light continually changing colors of light even when not in use even with the computer off which will run down the battery like the rechargeable feature but will be looking for another mouse 
0,not fan have had better for cheaper 
1,randomly moves the cursor to the top left definitely for gaming 
0,my mouse is not working properly just purchased it not even week ago sending it back
0,battery only lasted hrs after fully charged not recommend returning it 
1,the quality of the sound is pretty dope use this when work on stuff and when walk away from the speaker good feet still connected to the bluetooth and the battery life is amazing as well
1,these speakers are amazing and nothing short of that highly recommend them to anyone even considering them we have in our house and sync them together regularly to make the whole house able to hear clearly the music we stream 
0,i was really looking forward to having wireless mouse that rechargeable but since it has to be recharged every day just use it with the wire attached very disappointing 
0,product is extremly cheap looks like something from five below or wish you can see right through it and it dies really fast im sad missed the return window but will be buying new product
0,i wasted my money on buying two of these wireless led mouse they literally only lasted one week charged them the only activity is prompt red flashing light purchased high end well name brand wireless mouse 
1,this mouse arrived yesterday plugged it in for hours per the instructions and then started to use it it worked great once got off work turned it off and went about my merry way when returned and had to check on something tried to use it again and it is completely non responsive ve tried different usb ports unplugging and replugging the dongle and even charged it overnight to ensure that it had full charge it does not work was so excited for this mouse it slim and quiet which are both great qualities with the amount of travel that do while still getting some work done on my vacations but it not worth the money less than hours later and back to having to use my trackpad because this mouse decided it wasn going to work any longer 
1,third different one purchased like this because of all the positive reviews can believe them garbage right out of the box again won pair with the usb receiver won hold battery charge all done with these rechargeable garbage wireless mice 
1,very comfortable to wear while playing games 
0,i like this headset lot and use it primarily have two grievances the cord and the mic the cord is extremely long good but it gets tangled up with itself very easily and is difficult to fix the mic is poor quality everything else about it is good 
1,i gave this to my dad for father day and he loved it 
0,i love using this mouse it recharges fast and it lasts for days it quiet and my wrist didn hurt after using it for while 
1,this mouse is awesome the lights are fun and have owned it weeks and only charged it once and use it daily
0,i like not having to replace batteries all of the time and also the sleek design and color 
0,loved the mouse and was using it regularly for months just recently the scrolling wheel completely stopped working all of the other functions work but the scrolling feature is must for me 
0,i want to really like this speaker but overall it good quality sound not very loud good bass looks good my biggest complaint is the battery can run this speaker for more than minutes unplugged from the wall before the sound is getting chopped as if it about to die really disappointed considering this speaker wasn cheap 
0,like
0,it really cute and small it fits well in my hands and feels nice it worked well for about week after that it started having lag thought maybe it that did not charge it well but did idk if it me problem or it the mouse but haven been able to use it due to the lag 
0,we got this mouse for my teenage daughter and at first it worked great she only had it for weeks and it stopped working 
1,great product
0,i bought this mouse few months ago it worked very well for couple of months and now it has quit completely sorry to say my return time ended in april buyer beware 
1,it could easily just be me however found the headset to be to small around my ears and rather overly tight as well causing some discomfort that said the headset is beautiful and works perfectly 
0,very stiff and plasticy the lights dont work unless you have bunch of adapters and connecters mic part broke after couple months 
1,my yr old daughter is new to gaming and loves to game with my yr old nephews got them each this head set and so far they love it really didn want to spend on gaming headsets these are very reasonably priced and worth it definitely recommend it 
1,pro excellent backlighting lock keys indicators that are not usually seen on other wireless keyboards including logitech and microsoft the keyboard has great crisp positive feel there is no battery to replace it is perfectly sized for under desk trays con not sure if there is battery low indicator as the battery did run down too expensive 
0,junk
1,the sound and connectivity are great and the ability to charge my other devices makes it the perfect travel companion 
0,i bought these headphones for use on xbox and they sisnt even work with sound was then shipped another pair not the same hunterspider gaming headset headphones for ps ps switch xbox one pc with microphone noise reduction surround sound led light blue these were given to me instead and the mic doesnt even work on these 
0,love the sleep mode keep my mouse charged when forget to turn it off 
1,my headphones had just died so bought this to replace them and it works amazingly the sound is great quality and the noise cancelling is fantastic 
1,beautiful leds mouse works great 
1,love the clickity clicks of the mouse got it for my daughter for online school work and she loves the damn thing 
1,love this mouse makes my productivity rate hight while using my laptop and glad the light doesn have to be on because it can be very distracting 
1,i actually loved the mouse my only issue was that the charger came and the usb part was little off and would not fit but other than that love the mouse it works great and easy to use 
1, edit the company did reach out to me to tell me they are getting new supplier maybe the mic will work better for future customers they offered replacement refund as well but have already purchased new headset that works lot better they also tried to talk me into deleting the below review but it was my honest experience with the headset that received original review this worked well for very short while but now the microphone is way too quiet and nobody can hear me in discord the sound quality through the headphones is still good but can use it to game with other people because they can hear me it such shame it also doesn have an option to use the laptop microphone instead of the headset so can just use it for the headphones 
0,i bought this mouse thinking it would be good mouse for my mac when opened it it took many attempts to connect and then it kept draining all of its battery every night do not buy this mouse its quality is very cheap overall bad purchase will be returning this
0,bought for my son he is not easy on them but so far they are keeping up
0,cheap broke after months
1,doesn work and won charge cheap 
1,i needed really simple mouse for my laptop so got nice combination for cheap ease it fits fairly nicely in my hands super slim so it fits in my laptop bag without any issues 
1,i loved this product when first received it it lit up and lightweight and just pretty but that was very short lived it stopped working after just weeks of using it good thing it was on the cheaper side maybe it was disposable mouse that only was supposed to work for short period 
0,it is quality product for the price 
0,bought this keyboard for my son who wanted wireless for gaming we let it charge for full day the first day it was fine though my son thought the lights would stay lit while he was using it the second day it was lagging in its responses we charged it again which helped but not for long we returned it 
1,great keyboard connects quickly to pc and the battery last decent amount of time the only thing wish it had that it doesn would be that the light constantly stays on but unfortunately it does not not big deal though the first keyboard they sent to me was not registering every key pressed but it was never specific to any specific keys contacted customer support regarding the issue and after having me run few tests they determined the keyboard was defective and sent me new one within two days great company
1,i love it really good
1,great fit compact but very responsive 
0,i would refer anyone to buy this
0,i like that is quiet mouse however one side of the mouse stopped working was going to see if can get an exchange and missed it by days broken in less than month 
0,be very careful about leaving mouse plugged in cord caught fire while using it plugged in 
1,bought as gift for our son he loves them they work perfectly while he plays his games can hear what he playing or watching and he can hear me when tell him to do chores

1,excellent device very good sound quality battery life and bluetooth connectivity quick delivery to colombia 
0,i love this mouse its quiet modern and the lights are nice added touch pro tip remember to store the usb connector under the mouse when not in use have lost mine or damaged it in the past 
1,i was desperately in need of new keyboard and thought might as well upgrade to wireless board and mouse combo for the price and shipping speed was very excited for this product however it would not connect for longer than just few keystrokes then it would be unresponsive until left it alone for few minutes then could type another characters before starting the process over again promptly returned it and really like my new setup granted had to wait little longer will say this keyboard had great feel and excellent footprint for smaller desk it seemed fairly easy to be able to carry around with laptop although not recommended 
0,doesn hold charge lasted however long the battery was charged for initially and that was it 
1,my daughter uses them for gaming she loves them no complaints 
0,works as advertised would buy again
0,i move little bit and it disconnected doesn want to reconnect to my controller tryed every thing
1,first off love the color it what made me purchase it in the first place didn need mouse but like having spare now for my review as far as what used to for comfort this mouse sits flat so be aware of that if you plan on using it for long periods of time fits nicely in your hand have medium small hands so please take that into consideration with the review the lights loved the different light modes it actually made it feel like had gaming mouse while not being so hard on my wallet now for push button response my right click wasn working properly barely clicked down and would sometimes mia click from it being mispositioned had to lift it up to see the issue was the prong was bad broke it off and now it is clicking as intended so please be aware this is all very fragile plastic within its housing overall the mouse is great if you need spare and would buy again if needed another hate out of stars because feels worse than but feel an is more accurate to how feel as it has lot of great features such as charging vs batteries and an included usb adapter overall wonderful product that do recommend
1,i ve had this speaker for some time now like years today my wife and drove from our house to the store about miles away in the rain turning into the lot hear rattle on top of the car where put my speaker when was cleaning the garage and forgot about so whip into space freaking out that lost broke my speaker forever but it was still on the car jerking into the space made it fall though grabbed it turned it on connected played great this thing survived fall off my car after driving miles in the rain no regrets for this purchase

0,works well wish that the ear pieces were bit more comfortable sound quality very good mic seems to be good but windows settings keep changing don think it is in the headset fault 
0,i like the slim design and color 
0,good for the price it also doesn make the typical mouse clicking sound you can barely hear it 
0,my son brought his speaker over to listen to while he did some outdoor work for me after listened had to get one for myself 
1,i was kind of skeptical for only but definitely worth the price they are comfortable decent noise canceling and they look good too stars
1,i love these keyboard everything about it except the enter and keys the layout is different from any of the previous keyboards ve owned and the one that on my laptop if don get used to the layout in due time ll be returning it it pretty dumb 
1,great keyboard easy to use lasts long time and very colorful

1,excellent price an very comfortablethere are great
0,works about of the time making it more frustrating than if it was literally useless paperweight doesn work as mouse though 
1,i have had this mouse for almost months and use it at least hours day haven been paying close enough attention to amount of hours until it needs charging but in the time have had it have only had to charge it times and was able to continue to use it while charging do use it for gaming but my games don require fast and accurate like rpg etc so can say yes it does gaming for me but unsure about speed games pros it slim and long so it feels good in my hand even though it not ergonomically built and it fits nicely in my carry case the colors are soothing you have options for either standard usb or usb for chargingthe cons the on off button is teeny weeny and sits flush with the hole you need nails or stylus to turn it on the sensor underneath sometimes has issues with the mouse pad and it skates over the pad good shake usually gets it right all in all it priced reasonably for what you get update like everyone else just few days past the day return cutoff my mouse also died no power wouldn charge dead contacted the manufacturer mototo inc and they said they have year warranty on this mouse and they would be happy to send out new one 
1,love that this is so colorful works great with my mac
0,stopped working after days microphone can be detected by my xbox completely useless 
1,mixes really well with the whole game experience from footsteps to bullets highly recommend this product for your gaming needs 
0,works great adjustable lighting stays charged for long time no chord in the way smooth keys light weight only small complaints when it is in sleep mode whatever key you hit to wake it actually works therefore you have possibly typed wrong key when using password to open something also you can pick one solid color again nothing major would buy another one or recommend it 
0,poor package 
1,i bought mine in mint green it almost effortlessly easy to set up the battery is lasting beautifully absoulutely love it soooo much just ordered my daughter one in the dark gray she going to love the led lights thank you 
1,i think they sound fine they were pretty nice and do the job at great price
0,so have had this mouse for about weeks and it works perfectly never encountered the problems people had with it stopping and people say that the battery dies too quickly which have been using on the same battery without charging it for days my cursor has also never messed up it works just fine the only problem have with this device is the lighting is not nearly as impressive as thought it would be but guess that what you get for buying mouse for 
1,the speaker connected to my phone right away however it was very difficult to connect it to alexa and it didn work very smoothly had to go into the app to reconnect every time wanted to use it the main problem however is that it wouldn connect at all to the jbl app contacted customer service and they suggested resetting the speaker and explained how to do this followed the directions and the speaker behaved exactly as they said it would and then turned off success except not so much now the speaker won turn on at all hoping this is just defective device and when return it and receive my new one it will work much better if so will rate it again in more positive light added note once again was able to contact jbl customer service and they got the device working again it works perfectly except it still won connect to the jbl app after reading reviews of the app this is clearly failure of the app not the speaker love the speaker gave instead of only because of the problem with the jbl app 
1,good overall product for the money have had these headphones for one year now and they still work great the sound is good and the noise cancellation works pretty well they are mostly used with nintendo switch lite and they even work well with that happy with the product and would buy again 
0,for listening to music
1,this turns out to be exactly what needed the seller is so nice they sent little bit of extras like stickers and funny note to go with everything else they also have great customer service and are really willing to help with any issues great purchase 
1,it quiet you don hear the constant clicking and love the different color led lights
0,pretty didn work
1,not really ergonomic but don have an underlying issue where this is problem for me love the color changing aspect conversation piece and the charge lasts couple of days also turn it off when leave so really don know how long it really lasts but have not had any issues its mouse if you want it get it if you don don 
0,unfortunately these are for small ears they funtion just fine but the era cups don fit over my ears
0,had to throw it away because the metal part that goes into the computer came out
0,i purchased for our office the mouse looked nice and the colors were pretty but mine started having problems just few days later it was unresponsive and jerky for few days then it stopped working despite charging overnight tried charging on different outlets to make sure the outlet wasn bad but it wouldn hold charge and died again within minutes when asked the other employee about his identical mouse different color he said his never seemed to work right and wouldn hold charge used the included cord and tried charging with the computer with hub with power strip and with charging block not included plugged into multiple outlets when returning packaged the items as requested and requested the pick up slip we found the return slip face down on the ground on the sidewalk several feet in front of our office few days later not stuck to the door or in the mailbox mounted next to our front door no one knocked to let us know it was delivered and we wouldn have found it if staff member hadn gone out to sanitize the outside door handles now we have to take it to drop off location because return pickup is going to cost despite the package being ready to send before the return sticker was dropped off am unhappy with both the item and the return and have already ordered similar replacements from another seller 
1,i have had alot of keyboards in my time this one by far is the best for what use it for quiet love the sleep mode and it has very nice lights for nighttime use

1,nice size comfortable good battery life and plug in play 
1,noise canceling is great 
1,great price
1,i got this headset it is very good the microphone is stereo and works with every game try the audio is the best and the led light don shine in your face great headset overall edit after bit of use one ear is louder than the other
1,fantastic sounding speaker with lots of volume 
1,update tried charging more often and making sure turned it off seems it doesn last as long as hoped switched back to battery operated bluetooth mouse worked well for the time being bought and the other is still working for now as of now ve tried to use it on notebook tablet and desktop to ensure it connection issue maybe it the battery but not sure if sleep mode is active the battery shouldn be having issues in such brief time of having it it should last few days after full charge overnight 
0,bad audio broken mic flimsy big and you can hear the audio even with them on horrible headset would not recommend
1,update had it charging for less than minute and the whole house smelled like burning plastic in that time the cord got super hot and the part where it plugged into the mouse was super hot as well probably would have caught fire if left unattended update using different cords was just fine do not use the cord that comes with it update battery won hold charge was really wanting this mouse to work but looks like returning it after all 
1,friend who this was bought for said the headphones had good sound quality from his games he was playing but the microphone is muffled and you can barely make out what he saying through voice chat probably ok if you don care about being heard the design looks nice enough 
0,much better than expected
0,i bought this mouse with the expectation that it will work however it becomes unresponsive freezes frequently enough that have to use my touch pad half the time cheap and fun but not good if you use mouse often

1,i not rating this one star because it is cute mouse and like the design for some reason found my macbook trackpad more comfortable to use than this mouse my wrists were hurt within couple hours of using this mouse that being said used it in moderation wanted to like it however received this mouse january th as of january responsiveness has gone downhill after taking it off the charger it has short battery life it takes about seconds and moving the scroll wheel for it to respond again even then it might have some hard to ignore hiccups 
0,absolutely beautiful and sleek never worked charged it until it indicated it was fully charged but it never worked 
1,the song volume is acceptable but is not like the ads or the pay rewinding people show pd thx of god buy in discount price
0,i started using this product exactly month ago it will not work now unless it plugged into the charger which defeats the purpose of wireless mouse can recommend 
0,it cool guess

1,great speaker for the money love the sound this is my nd jbl brand blue tooth speaker 
1,great product excellent seller thank you 
0,i ve ordered of these in year because the wire end never lasts
0,the mouse had no issues working with my windows over all so nice and silence lovet
1,i was told the item was perfect brought item for teenage sons birthday claims it to be the best gift he had in years
1,update not sure why but this mouse is working better than it did when originally purchased it back in october use it every day and don mind charging it over night every couple of days or so it is comfortable to use and kind of funky in good way to use the changing lights feature from time to time naturally this will make the battery run down faster but once in while enjoy the light show lol and love how the click is so quiet they say they ve upgraded this product so hope you ll give it try too original review october my use of this mouse consists of following hours of use without the pretty little alternating lights on and then it switched off for the night before my next hours are over this thing runs out of life and must be charged again not at all thrilled with it it does have nice quiet click but if have to charge it every time use it don think it will last very long 
0,i bought it on june nd it august th and the microphone stopped working the return date was july rd have been trying to contact the seller and no success 
1,bought this for my husband birthday he loves it 
0,have had multiple jbl speakers never disappointed 
0,i used this once and when it died charged it for few days and it still won work 
1,it won turn on anymore only used it for weeks it rip off don get it it on as you see but won actually turn on 
1,excellent product for the price 
1,love this item works great never needs batteries light portable
0,the center scroll wheel lasted less than week the mouse itself still works but it is aggravating that every time you use muscle memory to scroll with wheel that doesn work decent battery life bought new different brand mouse to replace it the mouse also doesn have much of an arch to it so its not very ergonomic its better than laptop track pad though 
1,i got this keyboard to use for streaming as frequently need to move my keyboard depending on if gaming or using my desk space for my stream so far really like it the keys have good resistance but are not overly noisy the color on it is great and not distracting my only small complaint with the keyboard having the backslash key next to the enter key as ll frequently be trying to hit enter and hit that key instead because of the odd shape of the key but other than that have been very impressed with this keyboard especially at the price point 
1,this is one of the best bluetooth speakers have used the battery life is amazing only have to charge it like once week and love that you can charge your phone with it also 
1,the sound is great and it very easy for old people to use 
0,good quaility for price
1,simple to use long battery life recharges by plugging into your computer this is the first mouse ve enjoyed using that wasn wired this works much better than the old battery opperated ones and has much longer battery life 
0,small lightweight yet firm solid feel led lighting is nice touch shuts off automatically once laptop or pc is shutdown however the main reason purchased was because of the silent feature sadly it not as silent as had hoped clicks are still audible especially on scroll wheel which is disappointing why cant someone make truly silent mouse have yet to find one as most silent mice are merely muffled by rubber lining shame would be perfect otherwise
0,to loud definitely not quiet 
1,the sound quality is awesome so clear no matter how high the volume is 
1,super cute mouse love the color and love the led lights my only issue is that it very glitchy like it seems to want to do its own thing which isn good sit at desk for hours and it completely flat surface and the mouse will move all on its own 
1,works perfectly with my chromebook
0,it doesn work
0,mouse seems to work ok looks nice easy install etc biggest complaint is the time out and wake up feature every time go to use the pc it asleep then have to either click button which may may not cause an action on the pc or pick it up and down several times too annoying so stopped using it might keep it aside for use with my laptop when traveling definitely not for daily use 
1, cute colorful small lightweight quiet soft clicks easy quick set up 
1,way better than expected but still amazing speaker can change my phone don turn the vol to the max because want life of the speaker we go camping lot so far it lasted good hrs of nonstop music play vol medium high and did good along with charge two iphones xr and xs can complain at all 
1,it not quite as good as some of the high end headsets for comfort and noise canceling but it does good job at everything else definitely good value for the money spent 
1,the color is spot on it is ergonomic and more flat than arched sometimes think it is too wide but yet it not the price was right the color choices were great overall happy that found this mouse it was for my apple laptop as it didn have one and hated not having mouse to navigate
0,disliked
1,i enjoyed the look and watching this mouse light up but that is essentially it the battery storage on the mouse is super low so you ll have to plug it in any way after about half hour of use maybe an hour if you turn off the rainbow led light feature the mouse scroll wheel broke on me in middle of game not any aggressive game mind you just house decorating sim and ve hardly used it for the six or so months ve had it to sum up for quick cheap purchase it looks great but isn worth it in the long run and regret not buying different mouse 
0,product came in good box along with humorous company statement however everything afterwards was dismay the wireless keyboards has lot of lag the simplest way to describe it is pretty decent gamer and getting owned by noobs because of this system don even get me started on just using it for daily mundane tasks check and write emails the system would lag so much that would rather write whole essay in my cellphone and send it that way 
1,very happy with my purchase 
1,great product so far cool lights also not battery operated charged with usb cord 
0,likes sound mic quality
0,could not get it to work

1,got this for my daughter and she loves it it is rechargeable and lights up she loves that it is so quiet when she is using it to play game 
0,wouldn take charge and charge light kept turning off just as bad the keyboard lighting wouldn stay on which defeats its whole purpose very disappointed and returning product

0,nice to have
0,light and the clicks are very quiet it durable especially like the fact it light up and change colors
1,works great
1,great speaker sounds amazing my only gripe is the volume every time go up or down there is pretty big difference 
1,i stay up late to play my games and this has been lifesaver no more loud tv at night very clear sound and lightweight on my head love it 
0,the cord for the lights is not long enough to reach across the laptop and plug into the osb once the jack for sound is plugged in 
1,great product very loud can hear no outside noise very heavy duty star all the way highly recommend 
0,i ordered it on june and at the end of august the dongle broke off of my usb there is still metal piece stuck in the usb 
1,it was great to begin with for the price wasn expecting lot however the scroll wheel quit working within the first times of using it which is one of the reasons purchased it to begin with 
0,this thing bumps to the the point my neighbor gets out of bed puts on their robe walks theft to my door and politely but sternly asks yo can you turn down the bieber 
0,purchased for imac compter seamless setup and operation 
1,obsessed with this speaker great sound quality volume level charges my iphone fast and still maintains plenty of battery life ve taken this speaker on kayak and still works perfectly after getting wet and bumped around 
0,finally the wireless rechargeable mouse works as advertised small handy recharging is easy 
1,i really liked this mouse being able to charge it and not worry about batteries was working great up till today tried to pull the wireless usb from the chromebook and it only partially came out the cover to it was still stuck inside the port had to use tools to get it out and now it no longer usable very upset have lot of work have to get done and using mouse makes it smoother to navigate guess this would happen just after weeks of the return window closing have only had this since the end of july 
1,what didn like is that the cord was too long but overall when am gaming the mike and sound quality are pretty good and don get me started on the great price 
0,i rently sing the keyboard to type this reew if you notice any missing letters thts ply the adyig meai type this out dont know this is inditra atter sily ulty pd in all seriousness that speaks for itself just plugged the keyboard to charger to finish typing this review there may be some issue with the battery level indicator there no actual warning before that starts happening type at maybe wpm and the sentence above was gibberish dropped input after dropped input this keyboard is ok for casual webpage scrolling but don rely on it to do anything important after the first hour of use 
1,this little mouse works great for my needs it charges straight away from my laptop and functions as expected would buy it again and recommend it to anyone needing an inexpensive wireless mouse 
0,playing music
0,it was ok for cheap mouse it started lagging after few months and eventually quit working over all
0,they worked great for the time that they did but just little over month after having them the mic stopped working very disappointing to say the least and can even return them 
1,soft and comfortable
1,i ve used this for few months it worked great at first it would die on me after few hours of using so was pretty good about plugging it in when wasn using it now it just sometimes straight up doesn work which gets pretty frustrating ll even try to keep the power chord plugged in and turn it off and on again and it still doesn work that is very inconvenient at that point ll just have to turn it off keep it plugged in and take break from whatever doing 
0,careful with this one bought it last month the return window closed oct and it broke today any chance of good will exchange folks 
0,the first mouse lasted months and bought the same mouse to replace it it died within day of using it buy cheap get cheap not worth trying to have it replaced so am sending it back for refund the first one worked great and had satisfying button click shame it didn last very long 
1,i guess almost year for under is good enough especially if you want one that recharges because you don like fooling around with aa batteries battery life was good could use it all day with no problems 
0,used for my mac latop

0,for the price it way better than more expensive ones 
0,i love everything about this headset the only misleading thing is the box shows that it lights up but it doesnt
0,it works well
0,appearance size with built in charging 
1,i use it lot had for over month no issues have gold and it cute very easy to maneuver 
1,the pros decent mouse for what needed like that it is rechargeable via usb port and can be used as both wireless and wired when plugged in and recharging the cons these first two are mostly preferences so take them however you wish it sits fairly flat so there isn much arch of your hand to rest on depending on what you are used to in mouse this just makes it slightly less comfortable to use based on my personal preferences secondly it has silent soft click normally when you click mouse you feel and hear the click of the button this feels more like am pressing on touch screen there is no satisfying click nor is there sudden give in the button rather it feels like poking couch cushion this could be what you want in mouse so do with this info what you will this last con is not based on preferences however found that occasionally my cursor will studder step to the left when am moving the mouse to the right with the dual screens have this means that end up with my cursor all the way over on the other end of my work space when trying to get to the right to close tab or select tool in my adobe programs it nothing that has caused too many problems as it only happen every once in awhile but it was enough to stand out and earn it place in this review 
1,works great it not very sturdy or high quality but you get what you pay for also within minute not sure how much time exactly the lights won stay on it ll dim on you which don like you can change the settings to have slow blink or solid blink but it will turn dark after so many seconds which not big fan of 
0,good headset
1,it really nice and cute mouse so light and handy the charging battery it really useful
0,didn realize that there wasn place to put battery in so it always had to be charged after two or three weeks could no longer charge it and could not have it work cheaply made would not recommend if you need it long term or if you spend lot of time on the computer
1,perfect low profile for me not sure how long the charge will last with the led on but you can switch them off for the price nothing to complain about thanks
0,stoped working after week
0,the item is supposed to wake up after turning itself off in order to save battery but mine never did had to turn it off and then on again and then after days the cursor began moving wildly by itself and then later that day the buttons stopped working entirely 
1,so pretty so silent love this keyboard it compact no annoying handrest loving it 
0,it is pretty keyboard but the battery life is extremely disappointing ve had to plug it in to recharge about times now and it only just arrived days ago 
1,love small easy to take along and the sound is great 
1,love the sleek look amazing sound quality and extremely comfortable padding 
1,lights up for minute while plugged in to charge and then shuts off won turn on at all and the usb adapter it comes with doesn even fit into port my macbook a
1,never have to max out the volume and it has an amazing battery life like to workout almost everyday didn have to charge it for close to weeks 
1,i wish it had way to let me know when it needs to be recharged like how quiet it is and the lights are just fun 
1,the headsets have good weight to them and the light give pretty decent lighting one cable is for the lights usb and the other one is for the audio aux 
0,after day or the mouse would not work at all it was not problem with the connection my computer was able to pick up the bluetooth no problem the mouse itself would not work unless it was plugged into some sort of charger kind of defeats the purpose of wireless mouse 
1,it just okay for me it isn so quiet that would recommend it for quiet office but it quieter than standard keyboards the lighting effects are alright but they go to sleep after only few seconds and there no way to modify that there also no way to see the remaining battery power that ve found yet it was easy to setup but it worth noting that plugging the keyboard in with the charging cable doesn actually connect it to the pc so you still have to have the wireless receiver plugged in taking up an additional usb slot overall the keyboard just doesn impress me ve got half dozen other boards ve tried and ll probably try steel framed quiet mechanical keyboard next 
0,i was surprised about the great sound it connected almost by itself with my computer it makes my computer sound system sort of portable disappointed that the receiver sound stops as soon as connect the jbl computer cannot send bluetooth signal and hard wired signal to the receiver at the same time maybe need new computer 
0,my only complaint is these were meant to be christmas present and never expected they would not be in box or something and the person they were for answered door and since he asked for them he knew they were his kinda ruined that gift
1,super quiet you just don hear any clicks love that it is rechargeable instead of replacing batteries have had it for weeks and have only charged it twice 
1,the sound it good and people can hear me on video calls what don like is the fit on my head have big head and when pull it open to put on stretch just little feel like the plastic is about to break also the hard plasic isn great fit and feels kind of odd probably should have returned them but needed them for work so kept them people can hear me and can deal with it since am not on calls all day 
1,at first was little bit worried about the quality of this product but let me tell you this worked out perfectly 
0,nice and soft but the laser isn very accurate
0,real good and the charge last lot 
0,sound quality is as advertised battery life is exceptional feel good about this purchase 
1,sounds great even better in drywall corner have had it about two months and the deep ness of the sound is unparalleled 
0,product did not work as expected
0,its pretty but the charge doesn last long plug it in to my laptop to charge but the laptop shuts down after few minutes and the mouse quits charging there is short charging cord but no adaptor to plug it into the wall and it says not to use cell phone charging adaptors so recharging was pain 
0,nice keyboard unfortunately does not work well with xbox one input lag when using on xbox makes it unusable 
1,work very good my boys love them especially the lights 
0,after one charge it stopped charging anymore
1,so far it stood up to my year old he bought these with his christmas money for his fortnite an every chance he gets he is playing any game or movie has them on since the pandemic an being in virtual school and not really having any friends this was perfect for him to be able to interact and play with some friends that we knew personally an other people should definitely be sectioned out in age groups definitely not this companys fault by any means he isn very easy on them either sure ve heard them dropand hit our very hard floors no less that times an still going strong
1,works great
0,i am not impressed which is odd because ve owned few jbl products and they have been nothing shy of amazing have jbl rd generation now that have far better sounds quality than the th gen it won stay connected to blue tooth when the never have that problem there is feature with jbl that allows you to hook up to jbls together guess who won stay connected mine it so annoying and put in return for the item but got very sick and now can return it at all in my opinion it waste of money you are better off get something else 
1,love this for our cabin and playing music around the campfire great sound quality battery lasts forever the camo was super unique 
0,very good 
1,works great and the dpi does all need it too
1,perfect size for awesome sound quality bring it with me when want to play it loud 
0, update since writing this review they have emailed me twice offering refund if took the review down when didn reply they offered me refund again in return would have to remove the review they stated they were small company and my review was hurting them but with over reviews don see how that possible the light goes off like it is charged however it won turn on more than about seconds ve tried different charging cords and same thing happens don waste your money 
1,the item is actually nice the size color and lights are very cute and love that is rechargeable the only issue encounter was that when you leave it idle for few seconds and then try to use it it gets super slow and lags have to turn it off and back on to have the speed back to normal don know if that is feature to save power or if mine is defective ll try to reach out to the seller has anyone else experienced this issue 
1,bought it for my son he loves it great quality works great for playstation 
1,excellent mouse very smooth 
1,he uses it for gaming he is very thankful bought it for hin
1,i love this mouse cool color scheme and comfy to use
1,loved these so much bought another one they re great theyre nice and big with long cord so no tugging or accidentally pulling the cord out the sound quality is great you re able to hear even the smallest sounds on the game definitely recommend 
1,this is really well made pair of headphones the cord is very long which is the best part and it makes it even better because need long cord because my desktop is real far under my desk 
1,i ve been using logitech marble mice for years maybe over decade just love that you control the cursor with just your fingertips but it weakness is that the marble mouse scrolling function is clumsy and jerky as it lacks legit scroll wheel that is probably the sole reason bought this led wireless mouse the led mouse seems to function well it has sleep mode that easily wakes up and had pretty color light around it don use it for general mousing but for scrolling once get the cursor in the right window the mouse can be on the desk in my lap wherever it makes up for what don have with my marble mouse the price was right and think if it what paid for it it good cheap addition 
1,i am thrilled with the speaker use it to play podcasts mostly when exercising sound is excellent for spoken text and does good job with commercial pop rock etc it is not suitable for most art music classical does not handle the wide dynamic range of this type of music nor the subtle timbres of instrumental ensembles 
0,broken out of the box 
0,the product lasts about minutes and dies have charged it so many times and it still needs to be plugged in to work even when plugged in it still only lasts another minutes seller is in violation of amazon terms of agreement continually contacting customer private email asking to remove review review is factual and customer will continue to report abuse to amazon through email community help com do not purchase product due to poor quality and unregulated customer service practices 
1,very good makes typing so easy and not noise
1,definitely worth the money
0,just by the logitech and skip the savings from this cheap import bought this to replace wired mouse on my kvm switch and it worked great for two months would plug in to charge using an open usb port on my switch was super convenient turning it off every night while it charged the next day unplug and flip it to the middle setting so lights were not on constantly and was able to use for the whole day hrs no problem then about two weeks ago same usual routine go to use the next day and completely dead revert back to wired mouse and let it charge until lunch hrs later swap back out lights come on for about seconds and again completely dead now out of the return policy not even months later and screwed 
1,simple to use long battery life recharges by plugging into your computer this is the first mouse ve enjoyed using that wasn wired this works much better than the old battery opperated ones and has much longer battery life 
0,i have only used it for few months and it already broke when dropped it on the floor it too fragile 
0,overall the sound was decent 
0,i have purchased this mouse twice and each time it has phased out on me after about months of use it stopped holding charge and cold only use it while it was plugged in which defeats the meaning of wireless then it completely went out on me and can no longer use the mouse at all even when it is on the charging cable have gone through the customer reviews looking for fixes and nothing update now being offered money to remove my comment no will not can care less about my money back want what paid for and refund shouldn be contigent upon removing my comment again don buy 
0,the keyboard works good for normal use for gaming it is terrible you cannot press more than few keys at the same time if you do some don respond just broke it in half and threw it in the trash

1,smooth feeling keys nice design
1,i upgraded from jbl flip that couldn hold charge after about years was hesitant about buying speaker that has only driver but so far have zero complaints run speakers hard at my job and this one has no difficulty at all keeping up with the challenges give it it has huge battery that will certainly last you for hours have currently used it for roughly hours at work today at higher volumes and it claims to still be near full charge only time will tell another cool thing these speakers can do is connect to other speakers that have the same jbl connect feature other coworkers have compatible speakers that they love to hook up to it and it certainly turns work into party would highly recommend this speaker if you re looking for something that puts out high volume and has great battery life 
1,my other wireless mouse stopped working for some reason and required batteries so had to get another one love that it is rechargable and has the lights the lights change each time you touch the mouse on its side thats cool also love how the top of the mouse is so smooth and the gold color is actually shiny didnt know before buying but it has sleep mode so thats great for if forget to turn it off have to double check the manual but there are switches and dont know what the middle switch is for since the mouse hasnt worked in that function think its cool too that they include the adapter if you need to plug it into usb port to connect to your device honestly like it only other thing is im not sure how know when its dying again may be in the manual 
0,excelent product
0,sleek looking with lights but scroller on one did not work 
0,great battery life still feels flimsy and sometimes the keys are delayed 
1,this keyboard is amazing while wish the rhb was addressable really cannot complain
1,we used this on family campout and had great results the volume range is great sound quality is great and connectivity with our iphones is great the extra charge capacity is very handy as well 
1,i like the headset works good good for gaming easy only issue is the padding is little thin on the ears so after couple hours and starts hurting bit
0,i bought these to replace my old cheap headphones tried these on and they sounded worse than my old ones also no returns allowed disappointing 
1,i use this keyboard with my laptop for work it much more comfortable for me to type on than the mall laptop keyboard silent and has good touch great reactivity and the lights are fun don use it for gaming but as working keyboard it great 
1,this is cute and slim and love that don have to replace batteries just charge it up when my computer is not in use use it for web browsing as well as basic gaming 
1,imho think these are the best headphones for the price they are extremely durable and can withstand many drops without problem my grandpa got them for me and love them they even come with usb cable for led lights and an adapter to be able to use the microphone and headphones at the same time the headphone mic quality is actually really good for any type of work or gaming so in my opinion this product has five star rating 
1,seems to me that the left ctrl shift issue has been resolved can go into adobe illustrator and press ctrl shift and it will copy and paste in place for me that all really use it for lighting isn too bright but has nice ambiance to it no adjustment like their mouse their mouse as driver which can control more wish the keyboard had that keys had slim keyboard before and like playing on that little bit more keys are fairly quiet the keys are also taller so my fingers need to get used to it bit more bluetooth connectivity seems to be working good didn have any input lag
0,it is nice looking and quiet
0,quality for the price paid

1,love how soft and quiet it is super happy 
0,the keyboard worked fine for short while then the battery would lose its charge and while it is charging it would heat up the keyboard input area that it burnt my finger it finally died on me the other day so threw it away just for fyi was using their charging cord 
0,the enter key is hard to press after month on these keyboards tried two of them but no difference im not out of the return window and am stuck with it 
1,great sound and great battery life we listen to this on our patio and couldn be happier with it my year old son keeps taking it so think we will have to get him one for christmas 
1,sensor doesn always pick up movements to clarify am not using this gaming but as wireless mouse for work and coaching speech and debate sometimes when sit for too long the sensor takes time to come back online andreas movements this can be super frustrating when you are working and you need to move with alacrity but such is the life that one would expect from mouse overall you are doing menial office tasks this is probably an okay mouse the rechargeable batter is cool and am happy to not have to replace batteries but would probably go with wired mouse in the future 
0,i was really happy to use this mouse it light weight and really liked the color changing light however had it month and the wheel use to scroll up and down stopped working so basically it useless 
0,not attractive when lit up because the light leaks through the white shell just not attractive
0,i have used this mouse for two weeks now and it is now not working properly have charged it multiple times thinking maybe it was lacking because it didn charge all the way that wasn the issue the curser is lagging and am unable to use the center piece to scroll through pages couldn figure out how to message the seller to see what their next steps would be 
0,mouse is generic and seems like it worked couple of times then it was just never working good after that 
1,i love my speaker it my best friend

0,purchased two works as described you can beat this price highly recommend 
0,hot garbage sounds okay but the mic is trash 
1,this mouse was great for about two months then it stopped charging and won work don waste your money 
1,so really like these head phones travel alot and they are useful on my switch and my phone my tv still has headphone jack so can use it there too and then gaming on the computer too it wonderful headphones need to be made like this ve fallen asleep with them on and they have not been damaged o
1,this mouse works very well and has very long battery life very happy with this purchase 
0,this is horrible product my son has gone through two of these keyboards and they do not hold up keep their charge they both were used for about weeks before they would not keep their charge and would stop working within few minutes after charging all night this product is absolute garbage 
1,such nice product and at great price 
0,i especially like that there are no batteries it charges quickly 
1,i don use it for gaming that why give it three stars for that haven used sleep mode and don plan on it so gave it three stars not using that either the three stars for ergonomics is accurate because it could be little bit taller and we both have tiny hands will be small for someone with large hands for sure the colors are nice price is right oh and we like how it changes colors would buy again adapter that comes with are very convenient and worth the money paid just for the adapters 
0,i bought this to use with sims on playstation required zero setup right out of the box didn need to mess with ps settings or anything 
1,great sound easy to use don know about battery yet 
1,this is one of the most comfortable and user friendly mouses have used the sleek design makes for easy rest on your wrist and responds easily and effortlessly best feature it seeps if not used so it saves on the charge last for good use 
1,loved it at first sight lol
0,after couple months my mouse died don buy this thing 
0,don buy it for one is very inconvenient rechargeable you never know when mouse is out of juice two mouse is dead after just months
1,this speaker is awesome was bit skeptical about the passive radiators but was impressed it doesn pump bass as much as wired speaker such as echo plus but the sound is still excellent and the battery life is great usually play music off and on during my workweek and charge it once per week gave it stars due to the poor usb implementation the speaker charges through its usb port however it is only able to output power to act like powerbank and charge phone for example through its usb port my recommendation to jbl is to ditch the usb port entirely and use the usb port for charging and power output 
1,it great speaker would recommend
1,really quite while in use and beautiful to look at 
0,no stars will be given this item holds no charge and interferes with the rest of my computer this item is not useable it trusted
0,the left ctrl shift cannot be combined with many shortcuts in browsers such as ctrl shift for developer mode 
1,first set was ordered for xmas didn work had to order new pair so far so good with the new head set
1,i love it
0,i liked the fact that it actually worked it not just like these cheap plastic headphones would suggest some work on the wiring though 
1,i bought this to use as cheap racing headset to communicate with my drivers and surprisingly it works fantastic so far sound quality and noise canceling seems really good the real test will be in couple weeks at my first race 
1,so really like it like you can shut of the lights if you want it is sensitive so your mouse moves very easily and it very easy for person who has laptop 
0,just as advertised 
0,edit if you amplify the sound using rd party software this addresses the issue the headset is good for its price the headset mic is barely audible when connected to pc have tried updating the driver disabling other devices following the cookie cutter instructions in the manual and nothing has improved the mic situation if you read the other responses to the first question for this product you will see others have also had mic problems this headset is false marketing and criminal the mic basically does not work additionally the usb light up is ridiculous and an absolute waste of space initially thought it served as an audio usb connection but this is not the case the sound quality is not bad and they are comfortable but the whole point for me was to buy headset with mic am highly disappointed 
1,this is fun mouse love the gold and the light show it provides most importantly it works so well and makes me work at light speed 
1,love it
1,i bought this mouse for work it was great at first it supposedly rechargeable was able to charge it once fine it died again days later and now won charge or turn on ve tried different cords blocks and outlets so confident the problem is the mouse this is useless 
0,this mouse stop working within months of purchase plugged into computer via mouse with included cord and it still didn work throwing in trash 
0,the mic broke within month 
0,there were no instructions with the mouse 
1,my sister loves her mouse she uses it with her laptop 
1,i have both of these speakers and like them both here the long and short of it so you don have to research million reviews the charge is larger louder and has more bass like this one because don care about the miniscule differences in quality of mid high low that won be noticed anyways since this is speaker for pools parties etc the charge is smaller less expensive and has truer sound where the quality comes across as slightly but noticeably higher it not as loud and doesn have as much bass as the charge which sounds noticeably less authentic than the charge unless you re tech guy the deal with drivers mono vs stereo etc doesn matter all that much do you want louder bassier speaker that can be heard from further distance on bike ride around campfire etc get the charge do you want truer more authentic sound at lesser price get the charge 
1,love it playing game is more fun with this head set on 
1,great product love the features sound quality and durability
0,this was gift don know how it is doing
0,it stopped working within days of use 
1,fits my hand perfectly 
0,have no problems works just fine 
0,i love this bluetooth speaker so much but recently it has stopped charging ve done all of the trouble shooting and have handled it with care since got it really upset that can get it to charge anymore and now can even get it to stay on just outside of warranty upset don know if will be buying jbl again beware 
1,i was bit skeptical about it being quiet clicker but was pleased to learn it really is quiet the clicks are greatly muffled and are soft to the click my only complaint is that the scrolling wheel does not click quietly the lights are enjoyable but don display constant stream of colors as they forcibly manually change when moved or clicked they otherwise will rotate when the mouse is left idle overall it really nice mouse to buy and use comfortable and light kind of reminds me of the apple mouse 
1,fantastic
1,has great sound bluetooth connects fast and great battery like would buy it again 
1,great sound and battery life also love that you can charge mobile device with it 
0,they worked really well but broke after month the wires came apart
1,i listen to music none stop all day everyday ve bought tons of different bluetooth speakers jbl is the best by far some would say they are over priced but if you can get that same sound quality and battery life plus durability out of something cheaper what the point your just robbing yourself get the good stuff
1,it was easy to setup the mouse works perfectly and absolutely love the color change lighting 
1,had it for week and it was great until it started just randomly inputting keys and became unusable do not buy 
1,perfect for parties
0,was nice until it stopped working after only few weeks wouldn buy this again not worth the money 
0,after receiving this mouse charged the mouse per the instructions on normal rate usb charger non fast charger this took little under two hours for full charge the blue light goes out when fully charged installed the usb receiver into my computer and the mouse was recognized immediately on windows the mouse seems to work smoothly and the mouse pointer is swift you can adjust pointer speeds if it is too fast the mouse lights up around the sides when in use it is bit quirky but it doesn bother me also the mouse will go to sleep if not used for certain period of time probably to prolong the battery charge to wake the mouse just move it or press button overall it is decent wireless rechargeable mouse 
1,im having the party of my life ever since got my speaker my friends love it two thumbs up 
1,it works great as of now would definitely recommend
1,i just love this the lights are awesome going to buy more
0,it has been about months and this keyboard completely stopped working this lights are broken they don stay on and the light fr caps lock doesn turn on not to mention it won type whatsoever anymore do not recommend this keyboard 
1,great headset for gaming
1,the headset is great sounds great not so great in noice cancelling and my ears hurt after while using them because have glasses and they squish my them to my glasses but aside from that they are great and great sound 
1,i thought it was battery operated but didn read the description well enough it lasts about days between charges at least can see the keyboard without the lights on happy with it 
1,i like the way it handles while moving it think it is little small for big hand it is cute and colorful have not played any games with it yet but am sure it will be quick and smooth 
1,this mouse has the quietest click of any mouse ve ever owned and it puts itself to sleep if don move it for while it magical wasn sure about the color changing light but it not overpowering or distracting ve had very long line of previous wireless mice but think this is my favorite very pleased with this purchase 
1,i wish would have gotten one earlier love it and it makes working in my laptop so much easier
0,bought this item and worked only for few weeks wanted to return it but wasn able to do so in the time frame because got hit with covid was too sick to return this item and wish we could get our money back because the item doesn even work worked for few weeks and no longer will charge 
0,sick sound
1,i ve read lot of the one star reviews and have to say my experience is far far different following are few tidbits from my use of these jbl speakers have purchased seven of these from amazon five for my daughter and her family and own two myself the eq is controlled from the player you have connected to these speakers not by the speaker have cycled thru the eq on my mp player and the jbl picks them all up no there is no separate charge cord read the ad it says exactly that don act surprised when you open the box no wall charger just usb cord for charging true stereo separation for all you audiophiles out there requires minimum of three to six feet of speaker separation with home stereos not likely to be achieved by any speaker small as jbl but big fat so what use mine in the shower put it on ledge and wow wonderful sound quality with more volume than ever need quality costs money you will always get what you pay for go cheap get cheap if you go to the vendor list and grab the cheapest one out there don be surprised when you get look alike which in not made by jbl hooking up number of these speakers and spreading them around the room may sound as if the signal was getting to some slower than others appearing to be lag all of the speakers are getting the signal at exactly the same time what you are experiencing is the audio output doppler effect ll let you look that definition up by yourself so space the speakers closer to each other battery life you will experience great deal of battery life if you keep the volume down to reasonable level crank it up to full blown party time and it will eat up battery power truly hope my comments help to answer some of the questions posed about the jbl speaker no do not work for amazon or jbl am simply user wishing to put light on some misunderstandings john
1,i have had this mouse for while now love it it perfect size and the color change is probably my favorite part don have to recharge it everyday but really only use it for work so work an hour day again it really doesn need to be charged often when it time for charge the color will start to shift to red everyone that seen it has asked where got it and that they want one 
0,they are not compatible with xbox and therefore advertising falsely don care that they work with an adapter not included any headphones work with an adapter therefore false advertising 
1,worked perfectly was concerned it wouldn work with my new samsung galaxy probook but the little piece for the drive worked great as soon as attached the usb provided if you re worried it won be compatible don be it worked

1,i loved the look and feel of this mouse however it stopped working after only week of using it won charge at all and coworker said she had the same issue with the same mouse don waste your money

1,got this for great price the size is perfect for my hands and is easy setup 
1,the keys feel great while typing the reaction is fast the rgb lights work great and look cool overall great product for the price 
1,i use this mouse for work it didn require any weird setup like downloading software it super comfy and has sleep mode that activates after about minutes click of the button wakes it up and it ready to go don regularly use the light up mode but it is cool feature that is fun to show off have carpal tunnel and it so much better on my wrist than standard wired computer mouse most definitely worth the purchase 
1,quiet but backlit backlit lights turn off to save power but wake up with any key press looks nice and doesn clack like mechanical keyboard 
0,item as described used for kids computer 
1,great
1,the colors are fun and different the thing did not like was that the default color is red if it is not in rainbow mode the material is okay it works at it should it is great that its rechargeable it holds charge for long time and if you forget to turn it off the sleep mode works well 
0,not suitable for long term it broke after months

1,love this mousepad the clicking is silent and it looks pretty but the thing dies so fast work hour week from home and have to charge the mouse like every day
1,i like the keyboard for all of its features except for one the enter key it difficult to touch type due to the weird shape of the key keep hitting the backslash key when really want to hit the enter key normally the backslash key would be located on the end and right above the enter key this won be problem for those who don touch type but for those of us who do it an impossible reach when trying to fly at words per minute for this reason don recommend this particular keyboard going to be looking for new keyboard 
1,i wasn expecting much heading into my time with bengoo gaming headset after all it costs around and is made by relatively unproven brand surely it can beat the likes of astro steelseries turtle beach and the like right nope it can but what you do get is surprisingly solid pair of cans for your gaming needs the bengoo is an over ear headset featuring inline volume control flip boom microphone and non customizable blue led lights it looks the part it plays for those who like something bit flashy looking though personally was never fan of the sharp pointy edges that mainstream gaming accessories tend to sport 
1,product as described looks great with the lights ordered twice 
0,this keyboard was fine for larger hands than mine before buying notice the position of the enter key could not reach it with my pinkie without moving my hand away from the home position 
0,i have to push button to mute mic my last headphones could just move mic to mute however overall for the price they are good

1,quite and really easy to use 
1, and differently from the alienware saved about dollars love the fact you can switch the leds off to save battery also good battery is rechargeable although in about weeks never had to charge it yet good quality and fun to use also awfully cheap which is always plus not sure if is good match for gaming ve used it in the new ms flight simulator and must say the response was fine not sure though if it would be fast enough for the kill em all gamestotally recommended

0,this mouse is cheap and like the colors but the laser isn accurate so it can be slow and laggy occasionally its entirely unresponsive 
0,this pair of headphones has worked really well for me plan on buying another pair because my current pair has gotten damaged due to my putting the pair on uneven surfaces and the wires have been tugged on too much knocked the head phones down on accident several times walked while wearing these head phones and dropped my phone the cord itself got accidentally tugged and unplugged from my phone won be using these headphones outside my room anymore also my room is well enough organized now that shouldn end up knocking them over on accident anymore

1,i bought this keyboard because it was one of the cheaper ones with decent reviews and have to admit for the first month or so it was great but now it doesn connect well wirelessly and it hassle to try and get it to register the keys pressing which is frustrating when first got it there were no issues and it was comfortable enough to use like most standard keyboards and the rgbs are nice but the sleep mode gets tad bit annoying after while 
1,i loved my mouse and it worked great loved the light show and the fast response time with no lagging from the mouse then at weeks into having the mouse the type reciever that made the mouse work broke off was so bummed because really liked the mouse so took leap of faith and contacted the company to ask for replacement on just the receiver so that could use my mouse and they immediately apologized for the inconvenience and sent me brand new set at no cost lovely lady named iris helped me out thank you for being an honest company that stands behind the products you sell customer for life don hesitate to buy this item you wont regret it

1,has deep bass but wouldn mind bit more treble it sounds great outdoors and that without turning the volume all the way up did have some trouble setting up the stereo mode but figured it out we play this whenever we shower plus when we re getting ready and we charge it like every three weeks or so it only takes an hour or two to fully chargefor stereo mode pause the music and make sure only one speaker is connected via bluetooth press the connect button on both with the app open it ll show both speakers together and you can tap stereo below it it will not work if both speakers are connected via bluetooth it has to be just one and leave the other unpaired

1,great product
0,great sound and size my grandson trying to steal mine so just ordered him one for his birthday 
1,good sound but looks like you have helmet on it big 
0, 
1,just got this so not sure how it will hold up over time it was very well packaged could have drop kicked it without damage arrived within stated range the speaker was nearly fully charged charging was as easy as attaching usb came with usb cable but no adapter got plenty of those so actually happy about the non duplication bluetooth pairing with my android phone was quick and easy sound is bit base heavy but is rich and full no buzz even when cranked easily filling room it looks well built and based on my inspection could probably withstand complete submersion so far very happy if it continues to perform well will buy another one or more and link them for more intense sound experience the intended use of this speaker is relatively humid wine cellar 
1,they worked great when they connected 
1,this keyboard was great and effective at first ve had it for about months before it started having connectivity issues the keyboard is not communicating anymore and the keystrokes are not showing up on my screen the window to return this item closed months ago so stuck with this keyboard that will be recycling be wary of this product 
1,i wanted wireless mouse and this one fit my needs it is rechargeable and can be turned off which helps save battery power it can also be used while the charging cable is plugged in if necessary the colors are great touch and use them depending on the mood in at the time also like being able to choose the resolution on the fly with the button on the top have already recommended it to couple of friends 
1,i bought these for my son to use when playing the game and he loves them they do cancel out the noise so sometimes he has one ear on and one ear off yeller so he can usually hear me with them on the mic is clear when he is talking during the game 
0,i love this mouse the only reason gave it star rating is because the scroll wheel is opposite when scroll forward away from me the page goes down and when scroll backwards towards me the page goes up getting used to it but rather it just be like normal mouse is there any way to fix this or does anyone else have this problem 
1,really brings the sound to life the sound quality is by far the best compared to other headsets 
1,great headset for my son so far so good
1,i love it 
0,found out that this product does not work with computers can hear everything just fine but people can hear me which defeats the purpose of having headset
0,definitely holds charge the day it arrived put it in charge and it still going weeks later on single charge 
0,microphone doesnt work
1,i got these headphones to upgrade my cheap starter pair and have been using them to teach english online since january they have performed wonderfully can hear my students pronunciation very clearly my students have no trouble hearing or understanding me and am not dealing with headache after wearing them for five hours straight plus my chinese students think they look cool they ve been great investment and highly recommend them for other online esl teachers

1,i love this mouse cause it has really cool lights and really like that it petite and lightweight 
0,the product fits well in my hand and has quiet click but it keeps on cutting out will walk away for minute and the mouse does not work anymore so have to unplug it turn it off then back on and replug it in 
0,easy to install
1,i liked everything about this mouse was working great the couple of times week that used it then one day the scroll wheel stopped working completely no it not dirty there is no resistance it feels like it is free wheeling in there no explanation past return period 
0,the color and shape are very nice but the mouse and the packaging arrived very dirty the scroll wheel on the mouse is made from cheap rubbery silicone material and is completely crooked it also did not have good feel when testing it out not smooth and feels like it take lot of extra pressure to operate than others not sure if this is due to it being crooked or not but either way this will be returned 
1,love it
1,wasn able to link to another speaker don know why sounds good but wish the volume was little more sensitive we keep it low in the office but it fine line between to loud or to quiet like it though 
1,perfect for gaming and noise cancellation
0,granddaughter likes the lights
0,it worked less than month before it stopped charging and became useless purchased second one and will see how long it lasts 
0,the good decent sound quality and relatively comfortable the bad uses an analogue jack for the speakers making plugging it into certain devices difficult or impossible without an add on like splitter the microphone is an inflexible piece of plastic and people talk to online complain about my voice being muffled and distorted overall overpriced for what amounts to an okay pair of headphones 
0,it charged up the first time and didn charge up again after that and the replacement batteries for it cost more than the mouse itself very cool looking tho 
0,wish it was little louder expecteda lot more from james lancing
1,it came in great condition the only issue have is that the mic is apparently muffled this might be an issue with the audio splitter it comes with though 
0,this device sounds great it little bass heavy when listening indoors but outdoors it just right the only thing dislike is the charging indicators being on the bottom of the device so you have trouble seeing them when charging for the price it would have been nice to include usb charger 
0,it doesn move used for days and gave up really bad 
0,lasted little over month and the scroll wheel stopped working 
1,i was searching for wireless mouse on amazon and for the price this was no brainer received this mouse in the mail in small compact packaging very simple and easy to get it going the charging cable that it comes with charged the mouse in about hours once plugged it in the mouse lit up blue and turned off once it was fully charged purchased the gray to match my laptop looks good and not as shiny as thought it would be which is great very comfortable with it in my hand and have pretty big hands really receptive to the movement when scrolling the lights feature is cool if you want to have something different the silent mouse clicking is great feature as well if you ever have to do work in quiet space you will not hear the loud clicking noise coming from this mouse very satisfied with this purchase so far 
1,so glad purchased this for my business portable and amazing sound
1,not sure about the battery life as just got it and haven used it for any length of time the seller however was efficient and it seems like decent value at the price point 
1,ok my trackball that ve had for years is dying so went back to the mouse you can spend over on mouse but unless you are hardcore gamer and even then probably not worth it to be honest so went with this affordable mouse totally works it is very thin think would have liked little more meat on it maybe even for it to be big heavier but it so it worth it recommend 
0,i bought this because of the lights and it looked cool but it does not have battery it needs to be plugged in to charge unless you babysit it by always turning it off when you are done using it the charge dies after days and then you have dead mouse or one that is now wired as it charges too high maintenance for mouse 
0,this mouse is awful bought six weeks ago and one of them died in less than week the other just died got less than months out of these and now have to go looking again for more reliable one avoid this it looks nice but it doesn last
1,product is great and works well
0,the enter key is weirdly shaped the back lights do not stay on unless am typing and the key sticks use for work not gaming it is too much trouble to return but will not buy again 
0,i received the headset and the first time pluged it in the left side of the headset didn work no sound at all coming from that side

1,set up couldn be easier put the white usb thing into my computer and the mouse magically worked that all it took got the gold rose and it very pretty 
1,i purchased this to replace broken battery operated cordless mouse think dropped it one too many times thought would give this rechargeable mouse try hope that won have to recharge it too often only had to do the initial charge so far and do lot of clicking also chose this one for its flatter design my other one was higher and after using it long time my hand got stiff maybe this one won do that so far it hasn 
1,it advertise change of color of the light mine is only red the buttons have to hit it very had to the point that started to click on the board because my finger hurt very pretty very sleek so far works very good 
1,we first purchased this in december for my then year old he absolutely loved it after almost years of steady regular usage it was still holding up just fine then we got puppy who decided she liked the cords better for herself than the child when asked what kind of replacement he wanted he said the exact same one have had and so we purchased second one 
0,this mouse was ok when first got it have usb port in my tablet and ordered mouse for port what received was mouse for usb port an adapter not great solution as it sticks out from the tablet and tends to get hit by other objects plus an additional point of failure the mouse worked well for about weeks and then died it would take charge and show fully charged but then when turned on to either of the on positions the mouse would light up for seconds and then die discarded this mouse and used another one had around

1,i bought the jbl xtreme speaker few years back and loved it this one was purchased as gift for someone who spends lot of time outdoors and wood working so the cover for the charging port was necessary so far there have been issues and sound quality is great to be expected from jbl speakers
0,the item was sent without all the items in the box
1,worked great for month mouse connects via usb receiver ve only disconnected the receiver few times when not using the mouse however after disconnecting few times can reconnect the receiver without it being loose the instant my mouse connects it will disconnect because the usb is too loose now after month edit customer service reps have reached out to me offering me money to delete my review

1,love the sound and the portability of this speaker would buy again 
0,my grandson was so excited to use them with his playstation 
1,i love the way this mouse performs 
0,originally liked the idea of not having to use batteries tried using this mouse for about week when finished using it forgot to plug it in so the next time tried to use it the power was zapped that pretty much defeats the purpose of having cordless mouse with no power had to use it when plugged into my laptop sent it back and got mouse that requires on battery 
0,i could not rate the other categories ergonomics sleep mode or gaming because it never worked wish had paid more attention to the star reviews unfortunately missed the return by date wish had paid more attention to the star reviews do not buy

1,this has been awesome for sitting around the pool area not having to worry about it getting little wet the sound is fantastic highly recommend 
0,i ve had this headset for less than months and the mic has already started to go out have to have the cord certain way for it to work if the mic is working and move the cord whoever is on the other end can hear ridiculous amount of feedback play on twitch streams so it great to go back to watch and all you can focus on is the feedback from this headset not worth the spent rather buy razer headset that ll cost me more in the beginning but don have to worry about it braleaking months in 
0,it joke we tried for long time to get the mouse to even work and it doesn even after trying the mouse on multiple surfaces and troubleshooting thinking it was our computer we plugged in different mouse and it worked fine requested return of the item and had to pay for the return shipping and print the label absolute joke don waste your time

1,it is really quite except that the scroll button when you click it is really loud rgb is decent for the price but wish it was brighter overall its decent
1,it charged within an hour or two out of the box like the lightweight slim feel of the mouse the storage of the usb clip is secure and pretty easy to get in out while it not important like the changing colors of the lights inside the mouse just fun feature so far it works great for the inexpensive price

1,works wonderful
0,bought the rose gold one to match my laptop and while it not perfect match it still very pretty and love the lights it is very silent when clicking and very responsive when moving the mouse update so received this mouse exactly days ago and the scroll button is broke went to try to take it apart to fix it and even with the correct size screwdriver very small btw it just stripped the screw because it was so tightly screwed in so not only did my brand new less than week old mouse break they made it impossible to fix it by making fort nox screw not happy save your money 
1,i bought this for my niece birthday so she can talk to her friends while she games she absolutely loves it
1,this is piece of garbage it uncomfortable with small ear muffs that make it pain to wear the sound quality is subpar and the mic is so quiet unable to be heard at all even tested with my old mic and the difference is night and day even checked my windows settings and the mic was all the way up was absolutely baffled because all of the reviews here make this seem like halfway decent product but can assure you buying this is the single best way to waste money this is hunk of garbage

1,these headphones replaced another pair that just didn last these are working great and appear very durable and stylish my son loves them 
0,i bought this in november and it stopped working in january it also feels cheaply made should ve know this it does not charge ve charge it for long time multiple times it barely turned on before it died again piece of garbage 
1,work really well for normal use with gaming actually sound about as good as other headphones have with sound canceling turned off the mic is actually really good and clear long cord not very many complaints except maybe the ear pads might be tad but more comfortable but what you pay for them is really good price 
1,great quality

0,not the greatest
1,the headphones were great purchase overall good price for great quality the design and comfort of them are excellent would recommend them to other gamers looking for headsets 
1,the mouse lasts good while on charge as it shuts itself off good product 
1,my mouse no matter how charged it is loves to just randomly jump to the side of my screen it been like this since first plugged it in besides that it pretty and like how the lights combined it also really helped me with my carpal tunnel issues 
1,do they cancel out background noise not really but they are amazing headphones for the price just bought another one for my brother and have informed others to buy as well 
1,i love the flip down mic and sound canceling effect 
1,this is the second wireless mouse purchased both the same the first one works great have had it for while and love the look and feel the second one started sticking and locking up shortly after purchasing it hit or miss some days it fine other days want to throw it out the window

1,worked great in the beginning now it keeps disconnecting or won connect at all super fustrating it not even that old 
1,great product as advertised works really well very nice 
0,i bought this keyboard with limited expectations was completely surprised at how good it really is can beat it for the price 
1,for the money this mouse is great value needed new mouse as the click on my old brand name mouse was begging to miss wanted something fairly inexpensive wireless and rechargeable am tired of having to switch out batteries this mouse fit all those perfectly my first month impression is it excellent after the initial charge it still going strong with maybe an hour day usage after weeks it goes to sleep after period of inactivity which helps to conserve the battery my only gripe would be the slim profile think prefer little more bulk in my palm my only contact with the mouse when navigating is with my fingers no palm contact this does not deduct from my rating as it is clearly advertised as slim profile design all in am glad purchased this mouse if this company develops full contoured model would surely upgrade 
0,buyer beware used the keyboard for almost year and it was pretty solid no complaints but recently went to charge the keyboard and the charging port started to smoke and burned the port and charging cable almost caused fire in the office 
1,it barely works when you just plug the aux in but when you plug the usb or the mic in it low volume if it works it won output to the right audio setting or something idk ve troubleshooted it for too long giving up 
0,glitchy and charge doesn last
1,battery life was great worked great for while but it will not charge first time went to charge it plug it into my laptop and power brick it lights up for seconds then shuts off now it won turn on at all sadly would love to give this product more stars but now this is useless and can even use it while it plugged in 
1,i really liked that it was easy to set up really disliked the instructions which left much to be desired once figured out the problem myself setup was easy and seamless really like the way it looks and the ease of operation it only been in use for one day so guess will keep hoping that it works as well over time 
0,it works for now will see after some time 
0,these are perfect the quality and durability its beyond perfect thought because it was low priced that it would break simply but it didnt it fits perfectly and doesn irritate my ears 
0,the wheel button broke as it was simply built with thin plastic rod sent it back hard pass 
0,i guess you get what you paid for the mouse will not stay charged and will not connect with my ipad super disappointed 
0,it functions according to my expectation 
0,n a
1,this is the best wireless mouse ve ever used the flat profile keeps my arthritic hand from getting stiff and sore after long use the colors are subtle enough to be fun but not intrusive if you plan to use it with desktop computer be aware that the charging cord is very short so using the mouse while charging may be problem use it with laptop where this is not an obstacle the mouse appears very well made and sturdy 
1,solid gaming headset for very good price over the ear provides good noise cancellation the plastic materials used in the headset feel little cheap but ve had my headset for the last few years and it still works well
1,good looking keyboard my son love the color and its dual you can used with cord or without cord 
1,it solid keyboard it feels very light and less substantial that my previous ms wireless comfort keyboard which is still going strong after years it also feels very soft to the touch both the material itself and the key presses think part of this is in the waterproof design what really bought this for is smaller footprint than my previous keyboard it full size keyboard that requires substantially less desktop space it makes difference for my use backlighting for when typing at night and don want the harshness of an overhead light or even lamp sometimes the backlighting on this is great if you re fine with the multi color there is an option to turn it off during the day and there is also dimmer which works great what doesn work it weird but when editing text often use ctrl shift and the arrow keys to highlight large chunks of text at time so far this works on this keyboard but only if using ctrl shift keys on the left side together or the right side together it doesn fully work when use right ctrl left shift right arrow keys weird would have much preferred standard sized carriage return enter key for you youngins now to press enter my pinky has to travel much farther and it takes noticeable effort the old school reverse shaped enter key is king hope maybe on the version they will correct this if they did it would be worth buying again for that change alone still getting adjusted to the slightly new layout and key response my typing isn as fast yet find with this soft key press business have to press little more aggressively to get the space bar for instance to register it slight but noticeable whether you think that good thing or not is up to you definitely needs palm rest sensitive hands wrists may still prefer the design of curved keyboard swear by curved split keyboards they make difference don use it for gaming so no comment there imagine it responsive enough 
0,plenty loud to play music in my garage while workout with the door open no need to spend more for bigger speaker 
1,i only used this mouse for short while but it works very well was able to connect it using the usb transmitter very easily it does what it is supposed to do

0,did the job
0,i didn even notice until started typing on it but the forward slash key is to the left of the enter key instead of above so always accidentally hit it instead of the enter key nothing bad to say about the keyboard otherwise just strange design ll probably hang onto it as backup but the weird key placement is dealbreaker for me

1,these do not work with computers windows does not recognize them and no software exists to help you can hear people but the mic does not let people hear you they work great on laptops the mic and lights are problematic noise canceling and comfort are spot on with everything except computers

0,it is muc more than what expected

0,i was so excited when got my mouse in to go with my laptop and it didn even work had it charge over night while it was off and still wouldn connect 
1,some reviews says these headphones are better than ones no they are not have sony studio monitor mdr to compare with specs shows hz to khz not even close to khz sound like from metal barrel without high frequencies and with over boosted bass can not turn off led light there is thing like button on sound control box thought it should be led switch button it is not button at all 
0,wheel stop working after few months wouldn recommend now unable to get replacement mouse since it outside of the return window 
1,we needed wireless keyboard quickly and this keyboard from klim could not be better find the colors are fun and the keyboard has full keys that are quiet and responsive it takes up less space than our old model and so far it has been working really well make sure you take look at the booklet that comes with the keyboard it fun read about the company and the people who founded it

0,seems to hold charge for long time so far ve charged every couple of days work from home so my mouse gets lot of use got tired of replacing batteries in my other ones

0,the item was sent without all the items in the box
1,the headphones have nice design they the best headphones have own so far the sound quality is amazing as well 
1,the sound is awesome and has very good bass what like most is that it is rechargeable by usb connection and it is small enough to carry inside small backpack nevertheless the sound is loud enough to be heard across sq ft apartment or more and between walls great speaker for the money 
1,love it 
1,i bought it couple of weeks ago and couldn be happier so far just have to charge it one time per week because the battery life is excellent it loud and powerful obsessed with my white choice aesthetically it very cool 
0,great mouse for price thought it was bluetooth but its not still good though
0,i used the first pair for years and this is my second pair use these for work days week for hours per day and take them off and put them on at least times per shift so for the price point they ve done me quite well 
0,yes would
0,they do not work with an box one you have to buy adapter for them to work false advertising
1,absolutely love it it sometimes take me few tries to have it connected to my ps the sound is clear it so easy to use and it feels great on my head 
1,i bought this mouse because needed wireless mouse for work it came in cheap box written in mostly chinese it is nice color and it was easy to setup used this for work for weeks and today went to use it and it stopped working it didn register on the computer am sending this back for refund and ll just get logic tech 
0,it just wasn worth the money
0,best headset ve bought so far my first real headset my last one ve had for years and was the only one had since got my ps so was nervous to get another one this one is even better only sad part is can get it to light up
1,its great item except battery doesn last too long
0,this product is great ll have to but nd unit to have more sound throughout the beach house 
1,i love this mouse cool color scheme and comfy to use
0,works well when charged nearly impossible to charge though the port connection must be off 
1,stops working week after buying do not waste your money mine won stay connected to my computer constantly having to reconnect it
0,while this keyboard is good it not silent like the description says also the shape of the enter key is awkward and don like it but that is from personal perspective on like dislike for the shape it by no means takes away from the effectiveness of the keyboard will be looking for another one similar to this one maybe even the same brand 
1,bought this recently and very satisfied the audio is excellent my only issue is that the cord is very long but it can simply be wrapped great purchase 
1,amazing sound and battery life also worth buying several as they link up
1, quality is good dunno yet how ling the battery life is but just make sure to charge before going somewhere recommended 
1,easy light inexpensive quiet and perfect for my new mac laptop 
1,really like the quietness of the clicks flatter than most mice took little bit of getting used to but fine now will be easy to travel with very responsive charges by usb and lasts for several days no need to have extra batteries led lights are fun but hard to see in bright light looking at the screen when using the mouse who doesn so don really see the lights that much 
1,simply put it is great mouse for what it worth however had difficulty connecting the mouse to my macbook pro with the usb adapter that comes with the product have ports the manual grammar is terrible btw tells you to try different ports which they claim it will work normally in one of them none of them worked which was bummer then tried with my own adapter and it connected it right away the adapter they provide you is just useless so if you plan on getting this mouse to use with your macbook you should get separate adapter once connected it though it seemed to work perfectly smooth tracking silent clicks and the rgb lighting is beautiful just got it today so hopefully it will keep working the way they claim it should work 
0,works well but there is no way to adjust treble or base sound quality isn what we expected it to be used it days with variety of music and returned it 
0,i not going to lie this is probably the most awesome portable speaker have ever had in my life the battery lasts like hours and at links with other speakers which is awesome my only problem is don li had it months and it already stopped taking charge this is my nd jbl speaker to do that so don know if it just product problem or what but if it wasn for that would have given this out of stars 
1,jbl is beautifully designed sounds just perfect the only problem is if you give it to your daughter for her eighteenth birthday days later she may irresponsibley drive around town with it in her car and leave it at her friend house for weeks then one of her friends will likely steal it because it is such fantastic little speaker just take that into consideration before purchasing 
0,its really sleek and easy to use it can be used with almost any thing including phone 
1,hubby loves them
1,also good for adults nighttime joy 
0,this product is nice and easy to use but the sound quality isnt the best id much rather go with some turtle beach headphones or just earbuds all together

1,good value for what you pay they re comfortable the lights aren too bright and the sound is decent 
1,its really light weight and you don hear the mouse clicks however the usb blutooth is located at the bottom of the mouse didn have tough enough finger nails to pull the usb out logitech has their blutooth in the mouse where the battery is located but this didn have visible battery so used the tip of knife to pop the usb out almost nicked my hand from the blade getting the usb out you may do better job than me 
1,great design fits great in your hand easy to use loved it for the month ve had it but the scroll button just started spinning the last time turned it on that button no longer works no scrolling for me left and right still work and holds great charge however need to scroll and it is just past my return date

0,the mouse is so smooth and responsive when it died it wouldn take charge so is now useless about what expected for being so cheap pretty color though

0,it ok
1,the one currently using has been dropped number of times is currently wrapped with scotch tape wanted new one in the event the older one gives up quits on me and with this newer sleeker one it has splace for the usb connector to be stored for travel purposes on the underside of the mouse another great feature think

1,this speaker is great wonderful sound easy connectivity to bluetooth mostly long lasting battery life 
0, works well until it goes into sleep mode when you wake it up the cursor is incredibly laggy and skips around the only way to get that to stop is to turn it off and then back on which seems minuscule but it gets really annoy the longer you use it maybe just got defective one it got some really high marks but buyer beware video shows it being woken up then turn it off on and it works fine 
1,didn like not receiving charger cord which happens to be different from charge which have two of the charge have also no pamphlet or other paperwork seems like might not be new speaker itself works fine so far 
0,i purchased this for my mom and once the battery went dead it would not recharge

1,i very happy with the keyboard got it was well packaged and is very easy to use do enjoy the minimal sound and the texture of the keys the only key that is bit harsh on the fingers in the space bar but the rest is very nice and smooth the lights go off whenever the keyboard is not in use 
0,the mouse itself is easy to use however the usb usbc adapter does not work couldn get the mouse to work with my macbook until bought different adapter 
1,very comfortable good sound quality 
1,get what you pay for build quality is plasticky so don expect more than years tops sound quality is pretty good but the microphone isn particularly astounding 
1,the mouse was surprisingly lightweight am accustomed to the wireless mice that are battery powered and it makes huge difference it is super sensitive too was able to use it on fabric and on wood directly without issue my old mouse required mouse pad the lights can be left on or turned off but you still see the red glow of the sensor when lights are turned off the usb receiver was easily found underneath it was bit difficult to pull out but using my nails it came out pretty quick it also comes with the usb adapter which you don see often but believe it would work with chromebook or maybe with usb charger it has everything need and it is crazy how lightweight this thing is 
1,noise cancellation is awesome 
1,extremely comfortable works great looks gorgeous and is rechargeable charges quickly and easily and the battery lasts long time

0,i have had this mouse for month and other than like the colors it is worthless have tried every kind of surface and mouse pad and the performance is very erratic tried recharging and it is no better and today it just died in the middle of zoom meeting was hosting am flushing it and making note to never purchase this brand again 
0,i use this for my second computer and it broke tonight maybe used it total of times and all of sudden it broke of course it out of the return window don waste your money 
1,really nice headset sounds good and all the cable is extremely long came all twisted up and the sound would cut if tried to untangle it so had to return it 
1,sounds great excellent quality 
1,when first bought it felt bit skeptical about the product but when tried it out was definitely amazed with how much of difference it made in the sound quality of my games and honestly fell like this would be my go to product if ever so find myself needing new pair of headphones 
1,works great 
1,it was wonderful mouse when it arrived however it quit working 
0,it was quiet slim and responsive for month then the casing began pulling apart and the rolling cursor stopped responding too bad it was such short lived product 
0,the usb receiver was missing upon opening which was the main reason got this mouse tried using it with another laptop and after fully charging it it would not work after charging for hours and hours again it still would not work very disappointed 
1,i love these headphones noise cancelling is amazing especially for when your gaming no glitches so far with the sound quality would totally recommend these 
1,fast shipped love it the keyboard works great 
0,it cute mouse like the colors and it ergonomic however ve only had it for little over months and the scroll wheel just came loose and stopped working ve never had that happen with mouse so it not the best quality in the world 
0,it was quiet slim and responsive for month then the casing began pulling apart and the rolling cursor stopped responding too bad it was such short lived product 
1,clicking the right and left stick and it is slow to catch click cheap yes but as they say you get what you pay for cute yes but not worth the frustration 
0,quality was not worth it stopped working unexpectedly
0,the sound quality is fair and mic works fine the feel is very plastic and light 
0,very good for price 
1,intended to pair this charge with flip in jbl app to create stereo pair it can do it jbl app won allow it both speakers must be identical sent it back 
0,bought for laptop just poor performance of mouse 
0,it not the best you get what you pay for 
1, although it pretty it works great and love the colors got it for asthetics but it very functional work at home hours day and the charge is lasting quite long 
0,worked fine then quit not much for longevity get what you pay for guess 
0,battery dies quickly especially if you have the changing light mode on less than days of battery life with hr use 
0,i only had this item for month if that and it has already stopped working it will not hold charge and it is not the cable shouldn have ignored the other comments about it not working don make my same mistake 
1,it very comfortable to use minimal noise
0,it okay for first headset 
1,the quality was great and everything worked fine it was very easy to use but it only worked for about months until the mic stopped working it seems others had the same issue as well not too bad for price though edit the microphone started to work again it occasionally gets spotty and my audio can sound muffled to others but that not all the time the speakers still work great can hear clearly 
0,mic has always been quiet but after few months the mic stopped working at all 
0,the volume output of this speaker is disappointing even at max volume it seems quiet 
1, was actually about to return the mouse bc it stopped working and couldn find where to replace the batteries had thrown out the box and prob the instruction booklet can remember if it actually came with instruction booklet went to amazon and read the product detail and saw that it rechargeable mouse using usb cable like it small lightweight and comfortable it fit perfectly in my hand and when resting on top of the mouse the mouse didn feel bulky or heavy like the colors changing pretty coollike not battery operated you can charge using standard usb cable like and dislike read that there is silent option to mute click sound have not found it to test but like that there is the option to take the mouse silent after trying to research how to make the mouse silent have still not been able to do so like maybe great that there is sleep mode not sure where to find it or if have really cannot tell the difference the options in the back are off on and something that looks like sun when on the on option think think it in sleep mode bc the light turns red and then turn off but when on the sun mode the lights change dislike when using the mouse at first there are no issues this is the same experience if the mouse is used with usb cable or wireless randomly the mouse will then lag and get stuck needed to turn power on and off few times aside from the minor issue of latency and turning the mouse on and off it ok got this mouse as second mouse bc the original mouse purchased was taken by my son it is def for the more casual user surfing the internet or checking on ems if trying to use for work get mouse little bit more sturdy and reliable 
1,great headphones at great price sounds good the noise cancelation is okay and plugs right in to my ps 
1,this was christmas gift that was big hit the sound is wonderful and it very portable in trip to az we simply threw it into our computer bag and it went right with us we ve had one initial charge and it been playing for days for the bluetooth we used jbl charge 
1,good fit good sound plug and play 
1,worked good for week cheap and doesn work anymore tried to change battery but can open it and if it opens can figure it out order something else not this one did love the light on it 
1,its jbl speaker what else can you expect one of the best quality speakers out there 
1,great speaker take it anywhere as long as you have the space for it it big speaker but it honking battery life let me use it and charge my phone with it at the same time literally great speaker 
1,bought this for my husband for christmas and he always has it with him in the car that doesn have bluetooth in the garage at the pool this is probably the best gift have ever given the sound is very good and the battery life lasts good long time 
0,i have fan and this mic picks it up which is good and bad but id get for definitely not the price is not worth it tbh 
0,it only worked one day never would connect after that 
0,it works well 
1,the game sound and chat sound great fits alittle tight but it might just be that have big head definitely love this more than the dollar xbox headset got at walmart 
0,mouse is very pretty aesthetics of it is nice it handles well but it broke within couple days of getting it the button stuck wouldn click anymore unfortunately liked it so well this was the second one that ordered and the first one that ordered the rollerball stopped working but it too late to return that one so now have two broken ones the lights on at really cool the battery lasts really long time in between charging but now have two of them that have broken and six week think
1,i ve never had to charge it for the few weeks used it the lights cant change dont think but it doesnt matter to me the wireless range is good enough as well keys feel nice it sleeps when idle and find the wakeup very responsive havent had any issues with this havent really used the various function keys and never gamed with it use controller anyway but for what do it works perfectly 
1,love this product not the best at noise canceling but an amazing mic and headphone quality edit still not the noise canceling but it is good at quality good for starter headset 
0,very cheaply made another you get what you pay for suggest you pass 
1,beautiful my daughter loves it 
1,these are my very first pair of headphones for gaming so far love them haven had them long enough to give more details but will update for sure 
1,the packaging was very nice the box is high quality box that won get damaged during shipping the overall appearance when first seeing the headset was previously purchased headset that was more then double the price of the and they fell apart headset is great price and they look great 
1,great price solid sound and mic quality
1,i love this little mouse very well built and sturdy dropped it twice and nothing happened to it the colors do not fade fun lighting reliable and very long charging battery life use it almost every day and haven had to charge it in weeks ended up buying another one for my daughter and it just as well made 
0,it says it is supposed to install hardware automatically and should work once completed however that is not the case for mine and it doesn tell me what should be installed for me to try to find it on my own
1,good for gaming or playing music and not bad sound 
1,good mouse for regular use great rgb lighting
0,i bought this headset for my grandson july th and the microphone stopped functioning august st he only used the headset six times ridiculous 
1,you can really beat the price it actually little nicer than was anticipating given what paid would say it worth the price just this with my chromebook for my online classes the light is really cute too 
0,beats having to contend with the wire of wired mouse as well as having to use your finger on the little laptop control surface 
0,the device looks and feels good the left clicker is very sensitive and mandates that under normal use you keep your hand off of the top of the mouse on the left side or you will accidently left click the coloring is good looking but it is difficult to determine when you need to recharge the short charging cord connects to the computer so you must leave the computer on while recharging the mouse which is inconvenient but the control of the curser is good although occasionally it seems to jump to different place on the screen still not sure why that happens but it is decent value for the money once you teach yourself it quirks 
1,my grandsons love their new headsets would buy them again 
0,i bought this mouse for work and gaming the first one that arrived broke within the first week of using it the scroll wheel broke returned it and got replacement now the scroll wheel on the replacement mouse has broken and the return window has closed if you re looking for wireless mouse do yourself favor and spend little extra for quality that won break after month or two 
1,i love it easy to install and use mouse is soft and movies easily 
1,amazing headset the sound is amazing better than expected for great price thank you
1,i love this product
1,the keyboard is great and much more quiet than others gaming keyboards issue with power port which is flimsy and does not stay connected adequately
1,this mouse arrived yesterday plugged it in for hours per the instructions and then started to use it it worked great once got off work turned it off and went about my merry way when returned and had to check on something tried to use it again and it is completely non responsive ve tried different usb ports unplugging and replugging the dongle and even charged it overnight to ensure that it had full charge it does not work was so excited for this mouse it slim and quiet which are both great qualities with the amount of travel that do while still getting some work done on my vacations but it not worth the money less than hours later and back to having to use my trackpad because this mouse decided it wasn going to work any longer 
0,its cute and comfortable but tracks too slowly for gaming
1,if you love listening to the irritating sound if static and crackling then this headset is perfect for you as soon as took it out of the box and plugged it in was met with wonderful selection of static noises don even bother buying this product 
1,great keyboard for everyday use led nice brite only wish it would stay on longer or on all the time otherwise great keyboard
1,i ordered charge while back and was very happy decided to get another one for different place in my home after seeing charge was available and at the se price point as my older charge ordered it out of the box it has the same great jbl quality was very happy to hear jbl did away with the annoying start up and shut down tones bluetooth connection is faster and the sound is fuller than the charge we get more than advertised run time very well done jbl 
1,this charge is really great in terms of sound quality and battery life glad got it for my traveling back to nigeria

1,this is very very nice sturdy headset especially for the great price have previously owned headsets that were at least triple the price and still think these are better not only are they comfortable they are perfect for gaming which is what purchased them for will definitely be purchasing items from this company from now on 
1,i got this mouse on thursday night only charged it for less than minutes not full charge and have been using it for days in row on the red light mode only thought it would run out of power in day or two but is still working nicely the mouse feels comfortable under my palm not too big or too small was ready to be disappointed for the price vs quality but so far so good 
1,love this mouse love that don need to use batteries anymore it comfortable to use as well
0,even with sleep mode the battery doesn last full work day 
0,i purchased this mouse thinking it had usb connector not usb with usb adaptor my bad opted to keep it three stars on its scrolling as it was not smooth but it worked would have kept it but after couple of weeks it died and would not charge despite being plugged in for hours don waste your money go with tried and true brand

1,it works excellent it is very awesome
0,stopped working and wouldn re charge after few weeks threw it away 
0,item must ve been defective or something because in was it stopped working charging and pretty much would my work at will also the returns process with this vendor sucks it not via amazon had to go twice to ups because had to print the label or pay to print on site then had to also buy an envelope to ship it back in if would ve paid little bit more for higher quality would thane had to waste more time and money with the hassle save yourself the grief and get one little bit more upscale 
1,it super cute and love how it lights up which is probably the reason why the charge doesn last very long just make sure you stay on top of it and it will work trying to avoid buying one with batteries but this one is in any better

1,this speaker is service members dream its tatical which basically boils down to the colors match army gear this is win win for soldiers and nice thoughtful consideration that jbl made when releasing it in sand when times get sucky and everyone is feeling homesick some good tunes from this bring morale up happy to say it fits in my gear and carry it as an accountable item at all times durability seems high have had for months now and hopefully for much longer 
0,the adapter didnt work even though it said it would work with mac airs 
1,got it as gift for my sis who has ps she adores it
1,it was great mouse until it stopped working and charging literally only used it about times since buying it and when put it on the charger this last time it just completely stopped working the charger light wouldn come on and it wouldn charge even switched usbs to see if it maybe had short in the wire and still nothing now that reading other reviews see the problem wish would have read them thoroughly before buying it buy this only if you want something short lasting with pretty colors other than that don recommend this at all 
1,the photo compares the flip smaller and charge larger the charge is well worth the extra it louder more bass and much much crisper sound the flip sounds just like the wonderboom which is fine but not for really enjoying the range of sound of your music haven purchased any other bluetooth speakers so can speak on how these compare to bose or other more expensive brands for my needs in bedroom apartment of these in the bedroom kitchen and bathroom works nicely very easy to connect battery life is amazing does take time to charge but plays and charges at the same time they connected to one another easily 
1,bought this for my kiddos laptop she likes the lights and the almost weightless feeling it was good buy for the price and works great so far 
0, loved this mouse but after couple of months it started making weird noise while scrolling points for that

1,initially when ordered this it was pretty bad to be honest however the nice people at bengoo reached out and addressed to me that they have fixed the overall issues had with on the headset they were willing to send me another one after reviewing the new headphones was amazed at the improvement for the price this is definitely headset you want to get your hands on the sound quality is great and the mic quality is very clear am now very satisfied with this purchase if you are looking for reasonably priced top quality wired headsets this one should definitely be taken into consideration 
0,i find the jbl charge to be exceptional in all respects and recommend it highly am somewhat baffled however by the wild jump in price surrounding my purchase bought it for it was not on sale three days later the price had jumped to don think the original price was mistake because that was the price for the product in all the different colors offered jump in price seems extraordinary is it worth in my opinion probably but that is for you to decide 
1,omg in love with this charge the very first second pressed the play button amazing sound quality 
0,does the job 
1,never had an issue with refurbished until this one was dirty and won turn on recommend not getting used one it worth the time and extra money to get it new

1,my son is gamer and he is very loud so these were perfect gift for him 
0,i just got these mins ago and tried them first off it doesn light up unless you plug both ends into port which means console players won get the light up second it just all around horrible with its sound thee most quiet whisper like sound bought it on the grounds of the high rating and good reviews but it didn come close to standards don know if this is just defective or what but this ain it and am quite disappointed in the money just gave to company that couldn even hold standard for gaming

0,i brought it as gift it light up bluelight weight on the earsgreat sound
1,i can pair this with any connect plus speaker lol so paor it with my hk was shocked they work together thst surprised made me even more happy 
0,lovin it 
1,this mouse is amazing it has completed my work from home station and has made my desk look less cluttered what love about it the most is the led lights would never definitely buy and recommend this to other people 
1,the bluetooth receiver works well can put it in the back of my computer and not have an issue with connection much quieter than my previous click clack old keyboard but it not silent it gets louder the more quickly you type as well but if you take your time it can be decently quiet no extra buttons need to press fn to use the secondary key commands but works well for my purposes just leave the lights on unless guests come over lol 
1,mouse is nice thought there was an option to not have it light up since don need that function but the options are off one color and alternating many colors it only lights up while you are moving it and the light is off when its still glides good clicks well my only really issue with it is the scroller wheel can be little unreliable if want to scroll down just line or two it won move and then if scroll just little faster it zooms down the page overall decent
0,great little mouse precisely what was looking for except that it only lasted months ve had it just that long and the scroll wheel is now disconnected and doesn work anymore the mouse is still functional otherwise but use the scroll wheel constantly for work so will just keep it as backup and find something else 
1,outstanding in every way
0,directions suck charger sucks pretty color
1,the bass is good and the battery is amazing much better than charge the only thing that makes me feel bad is charge only have one driver on the right side which made the sound not even distribute from the speaker 
1,product worked well until it didn after months won charge or power on 
0,i have been using this for less than month and it doesn work it doesn hold charge 
0,love th wmouse but my wheel to scroll broke so be careful
0,after charging it stopped working so put it back on the charger thinking it wasn fully charged and nope still didn work this was waste of money 
1,it is sleek and like the fact that can charge it on my computer it does light up and it works great after sitting for while the mouse needs to wake up by pressing the right click 
1,i purchased this maybe months ago and it worked great the battery life is really impressive barely ever had to charge it and am pretty hardcore pc gamer no noticeable latency and it goes between sleep and active mode seamlessly the full color rgb is definite nice touch also the keys have nice soft press feel to them very quiet if you are looking for very pronounced mechanical keystroke this is not that their customer service responds extremely fast and was refreshing to have such helpful people respond to message in the fashion they did will order from again in the future 
0,cord was messed up as soon as got it sound would cut in and out every few seconds made it impossible to play any game with friends or game that requires sound would not recommend this to third world refugee to salvage as scrap metal piece of poop
1,i followed instructions for charging and tried few different methods but could never get this to power on or work the company was great to quickly refund it though 
1,this mouse is quite comfortable and silent recommended 
1,works great but wish it came with mounting straps

0,the keys are very easy to type on but hate how the keyboard has positive tilt built in this is bad for one wrists 
0,loved this at first but after only few weeks it no longer holds charge and no longer functions 
0,sound went out after uses
1,i didn like the way the light shown thru the top like the plastic was super thin and semi transparent and it didn come thru evenly have been using it for while now and it sometimes gives me trouble have to tap the bottom to get the red light back on and the wheel stops working sometimes just unplug usb and plug back in fixes it still stars because at this price it great 
0,its okay takes bit to get use too but it was only being used few hours for day it just stopped working see it has usb ports but no cord waste of money
1,i love this thing live on cal fire center and all my buddies here love this thing definitely would recommend the sound on this thing bumps battery life is great as well and best part about it is it charges your phone too if you connect it through usb 
0,when initially got my package the box was open on both sides but thankfully the headphones weren damaged the headphones work great so far and aside from the packaging don have anything negative to say about the product 
0,actually changed my mind on this mouse the one was using was driving me crazy because the clicking was so loud broke this one out of the box and it pretty cool it changes colors and it silent can work with the size being slimer 
1,sound is great very loud love it
1,since mainly draw art didn see need to have bulky gaming mouse this fits perfectly in my hand and has very quiet clicks which is ideal when drawing at night while the family is asleep the ability to switch between changing colors or just plain mouse mode is very useful for me enjoy the fact that you can turn it off with that very switch too as most mice at this price range never have that option it good buy for casual office or laid back working experience 
1,easy to use it took less than second to install it comes with charger connecter didn need to use it take the piece from under the mouse and put it directly in the computer turn mouse on and use real comfortable to my hand sleek bright colors and just cool accessory to my workspace 
1,good fit
0,stopped working after weeks would not buy again 
1,it wasn until my husband gave me his mouse to play my sims with that realized how much loved using one even on laptop he said could have his red and black one but lo and behold when opened up amazon and put in wireless mouse found my own type of dream mouse got the mint green colored one and honestly obsessed with the glowing of the different colors great mouse great price wish needed more than one to be honest 
1,works great with my mac book pro 
0,works well and charges very quickly
0,stopped working day and half after got it ve charged it and everything and it just won work good for the couple of hours that did use it thought the lights were pretty so give it two stars for having pretty lights but no other stars because it was waste of my money since it no longer works 
0,i just received this product today and even though there were numerous good reviews unfortunately cannot leave positive one due to the fact that this is useless due to non functional otg plug

1,won buy againdoesn lite up as promised
1,i love it
1,this mouse is more comfortable than my older model it accurate and quick when use it the sleep mode works great and it holds charge longer than expected it would so far it works as it should and the colors are cute feature 
1,a sweet ergonomic mouse with good responses 
0,this headset is ok for little kid for gaming or for someone starting out the sound quality is not the best this headset is meant for pc system and for console system 
1,it was cheap and the lights are fun but it was cheap and doesn work great squeaky wheel as you re scrolling sometimes it doesn track well so that annoying but it gets the job done if your patient select different one 
1,loved it love the colors 
0,this is not bluetooth product even though it shows up in results as bluetooth 
1,this was my second purchase pared with another charge to get stereo great sound the bass could be deeper but it still is acceptable two issues are there is no user manual and no wall charger so to pair two speakers had to rely on youtube to set it up also had to contact them to get wall charger specs using one that has volt amp output play the speakers at medium loud volume at best the battery is fairly depleted after to hours it would be great if they offered sub woofer 
0,the keyboard lights on but is slow and the key almost break didn like quality 
0,this mouse is great and if it didn do this one annoying thing would give it stars it emits really high pitched squeal when you don use mousepad it coincides with the led light color change if you pick it up and set it down it makes really high frequency sound that is very irritating if you work in quiet environment which do it similar to smoke alarm if it were far away get one that doesn have the lights that should help 
0,stop working after few days do not buy this mouse 
1,everything works great as they say perfect for gaming 
0,my speaker is not performing to it fullest ability it too low 
1, this headset is perfect for gaming love how cheap it is and it still really nice quality ve had the bengoo mic for about years and it been working like charm highly recommended you get this out of 
1,great product would buy again love the lights 
1,excellent
1,for the price realized could have gotten something lot better it cheaply made glitches even with full charge got the white one and wish would have read the reviews before hand because it does indeed show the whole internal lighting unit which just adds the the cheapness of it it does the job still all considering just think it value is overestimated 
0,this cable is so short when you plug it into any of the computers usb ports the mouse is suspended in mid air avoid by the way it doesn take batteries 
1,i love the quality and power that jbl delivers they never leave you hanging there it was delivered promptly the box was undamaged the packaging the speaker came in was pristine and the product itself was clean as ordered and has exceeded expectations would definitely buy this again or even the bigger better model 
1,love using this mouse the led lights are fascinating and fun so easy on the hand and wrist no pressure no numbness or tingling and my hand doesn get tired and achy have carpal tunnel so love the relief get now and know that will be really helpful and appreciated after my surgery 
1,my kiddo needed wireless mouse to take with him to school and this was so fun for him it light weight pretty durable and love that he can charge it along with his laptop at night 
0,battery life is great being able to use it as charger for other devices like to charge cell phone also major plus but where it suffers is the sound quality as others have mentioned the mono speaker is definitely weak point though the bass output is decent for its size the speaker barely seems to get as loud as our flip also when connected via bluetooth to our samsung tv for is quite noticeable lag in audio once again in comparison to the flip 
1,love how slim it is and battery free charge like cell phone and the beautiful colors that surrounds the mouse is outstanding
0,works well 
1,my year old son loves these headset they are made of good quality plastic and work very well 
1,literally won charge or turn on look somewhere else for mouse 
1,cool item easy to set up very pretty 
0,worked well on our camping trip
0,it was great for the weeks it lasted after weeks it would light up as if it was charging but never would hold the charge 
1,i love the power save mode
1,great sound and battery life 
0,i used this mouse once and it died after an hour was on the charger literally over night now can even get it to charge at all waste of my money 
1,won hold charge haven been able to use since ve got it cause it won turn on after multiple attempts
0,i ordered my first one in april and had to replace it in june because dropped it and the mouse wheel stopped working got the new one june th and today once again the mouse wheel stopped working out of nowhere it barely even lasted three months
1,aint the best but aint the worst either 
1,sound quality is perfect noise cancellation is ok but didn buy them for that so don mind very clear microphone when gaming 
1,i needed mouse for my laptop and so bought this the set up was really easy simply charge the mouse plug in the usb and done the silent clicks are indeed quiet but wouldn say they re completely inaudible but that totally okay with me when the mouse charges it turns blue and when it done charging the light will switch off when turn on the mouse to the color mode the colors fade nicely to the next the only nitpick for me is that wish the white part of the top of the mouse was more opaque so that the backlit colors don peek through it but it personal preference also like how it came with usb to usbc adapter just in case it needs to be used for mac overall great mouse 
1,love the size of it
1,keys feel good under your fingers rgb is very cool
1,these and the other chinese brand that are exactly the same are pretty good for the price have owned andnthisnis my th pair like anything else the cable does eventually good bad at the plug end however every set has lasted me over year think the shortest time frame was about year and half and that is using them basically every day for hours on end sound is not broadcast quality by any means but it not terrible either have never had any complaints from anyone saying they sound bad or hard to understand or hear 
0,very goo mic and the sound quality is good 
1,just not impressed at all these are supposed to be almost head phones not on sale but they definitely are not no base and could hear everything that was going on around me am returning them 
0,it broke within days of having this mouse accidentally dropped it as was picking up the mouse and my computer it cannot sustain fall from less than feet definitely did enjoy it for the days had it 
1,i so glad got this it easy to use and the sound is fine ve had it for months and no problems so far wish had gotten it sooner 
1,the sound quality is very good and it very comfortable product 
1,feels great sleek different colors for different laptops nice 
1,very good quality and very comfortable headphones
1, small lightweight charged pretty fast and lasted quite while perfect for what we need recommend 
0,this product doesn work as it should literally have to hold the type port into my macbook for it to stay on 
1,i grabbed this because was having difficulty with my mouse pad on my laptop but it great love how compact it is and it hasn had any issues since bought it like years ago 
0,i could not pair the mouse to my macbook air really don know why 
1, good audio comes with excellent cords perfect for gaming the noise cancellation works with everything but your voice making it perfect for talking to yourself while enjoying the high quality sound quality you aren real gamer without these beauties 
0,was great mouse until it stopped working which was less than months after purchased it it was used and charged as per instructions then it suddenly stopped functioning all together would not purchase again because even with its low cost it not worth it to only get months use out of it do not recommend 
0,works good for laptop
1,i bought this mouse so that could use it with my macbook unfortunately it barely works have tried for year now to get it to different surfaces and different ways to try and make it function better but it extremely slow and very glitchy and ends up slowing you down so much more than just using whatever mouse pad is on the laptop it extremely lightweight and made from cheap plastic was expecting that at least it would work but the lag time is so great that you re better off not using it at all 
0,i only had it for week and it quit charging even tried other charging ports it would not take charge waste of my money
1,i love it and the multicolored
0,mouse goes dormant after seconds and is extremely glitchy until you turn it off and back on and then it works ok until you stop using it again zero out of five would never buy again
1,i have small hands and my old mouse was too big for my hand this mouse is lower so don need to move my wrist and fingers higher to click it not cure but it great that it fits my hand much better and doesn put as much strain on my hand 
0,sound is clear and volume is loud
1,the headline says it all these sound great and have pretty good noise cancellation but they are very uncomfortable could only wear them for short amount of time before reverting back to my old headphones ended up throwing them away because won use them 
1,overall the set is fine nothing ridiculous you get what you pay for pretty much just needed fair priced pair to replace my blown out ones perhaps my biggest gripe about this product is that the volume knob is total joke there is very little range on the adjustment to the volume compared to how much the knob is able to turn on the way to turning it up the majority of the time you re turning the knob your volume is not adjusting the range feels like it begins and ends within less than third of the knob ability to turn in the volume increase direction 
0,we were very excited to get this speaker we have the jbl boom box connect when we turned it on and played music there was static and the music would speed up we updated the app and tried several things but the static etc stayed it very disappointing 
0,the mouse was working good and out of no where in the middle of me working it clicker just stop functioning unfortunately purchase this item on the th of january and my return window is now close really felt confident about this product and it is was nice while it lasted edit was spent replacement and it has given me any problems 
0,it was fire would definitely consider purchasing again 
1,this was gift for someone who is as familiar with the product as am have used this speaker in small public address capacity as well as personal listening device and it performs wonderfully best bang for the buck highly recommended 
1,nice mouse portable works great silent like the changing colors
0,this is the cheapest thing have ever seen the quality is horrible holding it in my hand feels like it weighs nothing it is extremely cheap the lights are neat tho they should be ashamed selling this for anymore then 
1,ok so love my new keyboard however there is one thing that is going to drive me crazy aside from by phone watch am terrible about having to recharge things am using this keyboard for work and it died on me twice it definitely my bad but still never had to worry about recharging keyboard before so if you are like me you may want to reconsider otherwise no complaints 
1,for the price this mouse is quite good top of the mouse is soft touch material it is comfortable to use not too big or small also like color of the light that always changes while am using the mouse am using this mouse for months my daughter have not broken it yet lol 
1,i just received this headset and so far it really great for long gaming nights with the boys 
1,works like it should the only complaint my son has is the padding over the ears feels bit too small but probably just have big head lol he says the noise canceling is really good as is the sound would buy again 
1,worked great very pretty aquamarine color easy you use precise and then suddenly died today stop charging so after few months it departed this world without sound not worth it wish it did going to order from another maker 
1,excellent speaker
1,works great 
0,i purchased this keyboard in january and it worked great now it has stopped working reinstalled the drives and still nothing hope they will stand by their product and send me replacement 
1,great spearker for the size of this speaker it really puts out great sound the battery life is pretty good but that depends on the volume you have it at haven tested the water proof abillity yet and hope don have to but have seen videos about it overall highly recommend this speaker it is really nice buy 
0,mouse only right clicks making it useless have read others are having this problem too went into computer settings everything is set up right mouse does not work
0,my son loves this product for gaming we had problem with the dongle and they issued me new keyboard within week will order more products from this company without hesitation 
1,it works great with lighting up clicking speed the scroll doesn work to move the screen up and down 
1,not sure how widespread problem it is but this headset is super uncomfortable on my ears to wear other than that the sound quality and mic on it is superb 
0,loved the mouse until the scroll wheel stopped working opened it up and the wheel has broken always used with care wouldn suggest buying if you re gamer or need to do lot of scrolling 
1,this is exactly the keyboard was looking for soft keys press easily wireless and the rainbow lights are bonus got thro keyboards about every years next time will not have search for what want because will definitely be buying this one again they do not last forever and now that know exactly what works the best for me will go to this keyboard again and again for all future purchases saw alot of other cool stuff on their site so will be picking up few more items from klim soon 
1,amazing sound 
1,nice keyboard does not come charged just plugin and works fine quick sleep mode and once you touch the keyboard the lights come on don like that and hope change it just haven been able to yet overall it smooth to type and is not loud at all 
0,really like the mouse until months in it started having issues just trying to move the cursor across the screen became struggle 
1,very happy wireless receiver plugged straight into the usb port on the ps and works wonderfully very happy
1,we use it for the workshop environment handymen artisans and similar workers often hear music or podcasts and this is really useful when your only other option is using phone speaker however it still small portable device and you can still look for something else if you re searching for the perfect audio experience home stereo is more suitable if you don move around to much or if it not hassle to load and setup home stereo every time you leave the workshop to work somewhere else very impressed with the sound coming from this liter sized device and taking it on planes or road trips is really what makes it so good 
0,for some reason when charger it it does not last long sometimes even have to use it while charging might have to return it
1,really like the way this wireless mouse feels acts my last one died and now almost glad it did so could buy this love the led light color changing when it in use and the auto shutdown when it not it performed well and moves easily great value too 
0,all good use it for days on the boat and around the house 
0,super unresponsive fun idea but would not recommend to anyone 
0,i have to change my review from star to star had surgery couple weeks ago so my keyboard sat unused for weeks and getting back to it it only works about half the time it either won type anything at all or it types the wrong thing nothing was spilled on it it is dust free undamaged etc now realize the lighting up underneath is hampering problem instead of good thing because if all it did was light up under the keys that would be fine but without the keys having painted on white letters they re virtually impossible to see and that pain in the ass wanted to return the keyboard for refund so could get different one but apparently passed that window while was recovering from surgery also have asked questions of the seller but they have yet to be answered so my original star review has now dropped to star and if this continues over the next week ll leave worse review and drop it to star for customer service alone paid for product and expect it to work and if it not going to work expect to be able to get my money back so can find product that does work am an author and gamer and this has really messed up both aspects 
1,i was slightly reluctant to buy because of the price but it was worth every penny even hooked it up to my tv and it completely changes any movie to near movie theater quality right in your home without the expensive set ups love how portable it iswith long battery life to boot it daily use for the warehouse work in for all the music we play at work 
1,i actually have pixel slate and it works great with it 
1,very good fit and comfortable the audio quality is fantastic and the microphone works great much higher quality than would have expected at this price point really can go wrong with these headphones 
0,got this for my husband for christmas and he uses it all the time he loves it and it works great worth the money update it was worth the money until it just stopped working so my husband only uses it to listen to music while he taking showers and it sits on the windowsill that three feet away from the shower so it doesn get wet and he regularly charges it one day two weeks ago he tried to connect to it before shower and it saying it connected but not playing anything he let it charge turned it in and off and it still not doing anything really thought this would be worth the money especially with how much he loved it but apparently they just stop working after two months do not recommend this purchase sad to have spent so much on it 
1,my son enjoyed the sound quality of the headset and loved that it turned on the colors 
1,went through variety of brands and models doing ton of research before settling on this one it more than lived up to expectations fantastic sound and looks cool
1,the slim design feels amazing the price is perfect and the lights on it just make it fun worth it 
0,good audio
1,works great just feels little flimsy so not sure how it will hold up suppose it good value for the price the slowly changing colored led lights are pretty cool like that unlike the apple magic mouse you can use this mouse while it is charging the seller extended the warranty another months after registered it so that gives me little more confidence in the quality or at least the customer service was compensated by the seller for this review with refund of the purchase price of the mouse 
0,speaker did not come with charger 
0,i had this keyboard for months and recently as other reviewers have mentioned the bluetooth receiver fell apart it was kind of loose in the usb port for while but managed to leave it alone however packing and unpacking my laptop more than usual on business trip jiggled it enough that it came out except the shell of the receiver is still stuck in the port will have to take it somewhere to have professional use pliers and whatever to unstick that without damaging the laptop as would likely do on my own while it was working the keyboard performed fine only had to plug it in to charge it few times since it didn even last year because one of the most essential elements was made with shoddy materials have to give stars though 
0,the keyboard is good it does not have any noise the light is cool but sometimes the keyboard would repeat press one key 
0,it works perfectly in my macbook proupdate now it does not work anymore very disappointed
0,very good
0, sleek design and very responsive and most all it sleeps when you re not using it 
0,the scrolling mechanism stopped working within minutes of use didn drop it or handle it improperly it just piece of junk 
1,i not much of gamer but got these for work conference calls because my computer mic is terrible the first thing noticed is that they felt like they were made with cheap plastic the ear cushions are super stiff and they don seem to get worn in after using them even though don game too much still have some multi hour sessions on gta at night and use these so dont wake up my house the sound is good but the ear cushions really start hurting my ears after prolonged usage if you re looking for comfort go elsewhere the overall sound is good not great absolutely no noise cancelling functions 
0,this is the second time purchase this mouse in matter of few months and the second one is already not working at all charged it and all and nothing have the rose gold one can you guys please send new one or refund me like the color matches my laptop well but refuse to keep re purchasing every other few months 
0,cool
0,the mouse would be fine except it stopped tracking within month cheaper isn better
1,have nothing bad to say it does it job and does it well
1, so for bucks this is pretty good headset noise cancellation isn too bad the sound quality is really good actually actually would buy this again for bucks is not bad at all 
1,i really enjoy the feel of the mouse it slick which has put less strain on my wrist but ll still be getting wrist support the colors don need to be turned on and when left in middle it keeps the mouse on with only the red light from underneath 
0,keys are smooth and with quick response when typing

1,great sound especially for the money plus for any gathering indoors outside 
1,great sound and good battery life 
0,bought it on black friday the sound is little bit blurry that might be due to waterproof function sound format only supports sbc which is the most disappointed thing overall would rank it above average considering the promotional price on black friday and suitable for those who like bring their speaker for outdoor activities 
1,i lost my usb receptor sent an email requesting help and their customer service rep lolita helped me they sent new one for free when received they provided me the instruction to pair my receptor points excelent servicekeyboard is awesome thanks klm 
1,the headset has great sound quality and feels very comfortable very realistic sound quality as if you are in the game great mic quality so other players can hear you very well

1,loved the headset incredible sound
1,nice headset loud quality sound and great for noise cancelling 
1,i wish it had way to let me know when it needs to be recharged like how quiet it is and the lights are just fun 
1,i had never heard of this brand and was little concerned might be buying some weird off brand that was of poor quality so glad that not the case this keyboard is all quality they keys feel amazing to type on the lighting comes with few options like adjusting brightness and the whole thing feels sturdy set up was easy of course was reading through the few inserts that come in the packaging and there even cute description of how the keyboard was shipped to me 
1,its pretty good guess
0,the led lights are pretty but otherwise this mouse is not responding well and overall does not handle too well am disappointed and would not buy it again 
1,cool looking comfortable light weight 
1,i love the design and ease of use older so am used to using mouse this works perfectly

0,it looks great and feels good in the hand but the scroller broke after couple months 
1,this mouse works perfectly for my macbook enjoy the color changing effect lots of fun to use feels good in your hand 
0,it stopped working
1,microphone doesn work at all doesn even show up in my ability to locate and change settings on devices to use the microphone as well as the switch to mute the mic doesn work because my computer can only use the mic from the computer this headset is real let down just go back to using my bluetooth headset that more comfortable and can walk around in but without mic on it if required to be at the computer to use the mic anyway 
0,didnt last long
0,when use it the pointer jumps around alot 
0, big design problems the lights don stay on probably to conserve the battery this means if you are not using the keyboard for few seconds say you are just using the mouse or just reading the screen the keys go dark then you can see whatever key you need to hit first when you are ready the enter key is one key farther to the right than standard keyboard as life long touch typist now am tying when mean to hit enter so not only did not gain the ability to see the keys in the dark but lost the expected location of the enter key just couple of points of clarification you cannot change the colors you can just adjust the brightness of the backlighting and you can put it on some weird breath setting where it slowly goes brigher and darker this does not take batteries like most wireless keyboards it actually requires wire to charge the built in battery which is billed as taking hours to charge for hours of usage might as well leave it connected so much for wireless 
1,love the keyboard everything about it it was great purchase 
0,works fine nothing special and not quite as smooth as standard mouses you can get at big box stores for 
1,great sounding speaker 
0,this is quick responsive and easy to use mouse it can be run normally or with it built in lights sleeps after short period of unuse but wakes with single click micro usb charging cable included charges the mouse in no time light is on when charging and turns off when done with the sleep mode the battery lasts longer than expected 
1,headset is super comfortable and does good job tuning out the noise of the outside world it works great with my mac and android device if the case is removed absolutely love the sound quality
0,it worked good at first but it will not respond anymore even after being fully charged waste of money it cute though good thing it stopped working right away so can still return it 
1,works great
1,they are awesome and great sound 
1,i have trouble getting it to keep up good audio sometimes it ok but it been going downhill steadily for year mic has only one axis of rotation so can get it closer to my mouth that part of the issue but only part it also not very comfy as the spring force is too strong and the earmuffs too firm overall they are cheap and they feel like it and sound like it would get something better were you 
0,i assumed this speaker would sound better than the jbl flip that have but not convinced as of yet maybe after listening to it for while ll change my mind 
0,it is exactly what wanted
0,it doesn charge anymore 
1,sounds great in spite of its size very durable super handy buy it again in heartbeat 
0,real light weight easy to use connects quickly
1,very easy to use and efficient 
1,this barely ever needs to be charged for me have online schooling so use the mouse lot and only have to charge it every once and while its very pretty and good for the price makes no sound when clicked which is great 
1,great price lightweight charges fast lasts long time or plug in to use love the backlight quiet waterproof for accidental spills overall great keyboard better than one that paid as much for 
0,arrived with broken button description says silent but keys are just as loud as mechanical keyboard 
0,tried on multiple surface and no matter what do the pointer is erratic it also never goes into sleep mode if you fail to turn it off you will run through the battery in day awful tried to click on the seller name in an effort to contact them directly but it was grayed out very disappointed 
1,i professional musician and spend lot of time listening to music with critical ear didn expect much from the jbl but was surprised at the sound quality pumped out by this compact unit connected to my phone effortlessly good bass tones and definition in the highs gets pretty loud too highly recommend for when you want music away from your home base 
1,great product for the price
0,liked it lot until it stopped working after only using it intermittently for couple months no longer will right click
0,this mouse is rechargeable which is great except that it doesn hold charge charged it all night and the next day it died after using it for minutes would not recommend this item and will go back to wireless mouse that uses batteries

0,good sound
0,really comfy and good sound
1,connects easily super cute 
1,he loves them 
1,i often as we all do use my laptop in less than bright conditions and prefer keyboard that flashes along with my typing this one was purchased for when up at our cabin had received it in march took it up then hadn used it again until recently in june when went back up was typing away and caught that the letter wasn working since have one of those in my name it sorta important pulled out the information in the little black envelope that came with the keyboard and found it to be entertaining sent message to contact us and vincent replied he the man with the hats all is well my replacement flashes the and the discovered that afterwards all are present now the new one also has fully lit characters which led me to realize that they all were only half lit with the first keyboard highly recommend this keyboard and klim technologies 
0,if you leave the mouse unactive for minute or two you have to turn the mouse off and back on or the mouse will lag skip across the screen as you try to move the mouse around it is extremely annoying 
1,excellent price an very comfortablethere are great
1,this was gift for one of my grandsons and he uses it with his switch his brother also has one that he has had for about year so asked them about their experiences grandson says he likes the mic and the noise cancellation helps with any surround sound overall they are perfect for any device with circle headphone slot grandson says he loves them they are comfortable and can be adjusted he likes the mic they say five stars 
0,the mic doesn work 
1,i purchased this for my son gaming computer he loves it thank you
1,great keyboard
0,i bought it for gaming and everyday use it stopped working really fast it lags behind which was driving me crazy then it just died after month don waste your money
1,for the price these are amazing and the best headphones for the price if you re casually gaming and or have neighbors that don like hearing noises this is the headset for you if you re competing online and need to communicate clearly with your teammates do not recommend this headset for you because the audio is not crystal clear from the built in microphone 
0,the cord is entirely too irritating and in the way 
1,love it 
0,i bought this mouse on the th of august and it broke on the st of the same month basically it lasted me for less than month the lights stopped working properly and then the middle part to scroll stopped working it broke do not recommend at all
1,i recently bought new chromebook and wanted wireless mouse to match came across this mouse and after reading the reviews figured id give it try cant say how good it works yet because never recieved the usb adaptor with it and for some reason cant get it to connect wireless im sure ill figure it out but it wouldve been nice to have the wire option as well otherwise its slim which is what wanted and like the lights on it
0,the usb only works for the lights not for connecting the device to your computer 
1,nothing to say its so perfect 
0,the different colored lights stopped working after week and it only had red light after two months the mouse stopped working entirely sucks because it too late to return it
0,i used this headset with my xbox one got it for on black friday deal which was nice though guess got what paid for was lured in little by the led lights and was bit disappointed to find out wouldn be able to use them since they only activate when connected to pc the sound quality was as expected for headset wasn amazing but was by no means terrible the ear cuffs are definitely noise blocking and they re surprisingly comfortable to wear even if you wear glasses since wear glasses most headsets start to hurt my ears after while but experienced no pain with this one the mic was okay never really had any problems with it did have slight problems with the volume control though sometimes it would catch rub on my clothing and randomly turn the volume up or down wasn that big of an issue though since it rarely happened say my only valid complaint was the letdown of only having it for months before it died was really excited about this headset the whole reason bought it was so could get something that would last me bit longer than cheap headset would but it barely lasted me four months what even worse is that still currently have headset that has lasted longer and someone who takes care of all things electronic and electronic related so this was the result of the actual headset failing might have given it or stars had it been of use for just little while longer 
0,in order for your lights to work you would need hdmi extender to connect to your controller and or outlet
0,too much bother to charge when at the office cannot leave on my desk for fears of loosing it
1,will buy again if needed also perfect gift for any gamers 
1,super comfortable except does not work for call center agents on computers
1,i initially got this keyboard for my wife and all the work she was doing but her laptop keyboard had gone out this keyboard was so awesome and user friendly love the key impact love the light up nature and liked it so much that purchased one for myself for work it solid keyboard for the money great value 
0,confortable to use silent clic and battery lasts lot
0,the mouse worked great and then one afternoon as was working the middle center stopped working couldn use it to scroll up and down anymore not even two months old and it not working 
1,excellent mouse

1,this mouse is garbage buyer beware doesn hold charge doesn move the cursor bought for separate computers and its the same for both amazon basics mouse is better
0,loved everything about this mouse until the charging jack came loose after three months of use there is no way to charge it now guess you get what you pay for 
0,while working on my desk close by book fell on top of the mouse and now it doesn take charge by the way it was the first day zi was using it 
1,the mouse is comfortable it easy to click it doesn get stuck or it isn too loose or too hard the mouse itself is good size for my hands the colors are very vibrant and pretty they are soothing to see thank you for the complimentary mouse pad it was thoughtful 
1,the quality is great going to buy another one for the upstairs 
1,can not believe how long the battery lasts very crisp and clear sounds way louder than it looks yes it actually is water proof 
1,works great for home office and gaming
1,great sound quality and perfect size the green is matte finish and blends in well with my boat 
0,regularly stops tracking movement into disjoint and jerky cursor movement seems to depend on the color of the surface underneath based on my multicolor mousepad oem harassed me with emails about changing my review amazon leaked my email that was only given to amazon 
0,i bought this mouse few months ago and the usb receiver broke however contacted the seller about the issue and they sent me new mouse at no cost 
1,works well charge last long timedelivery time is good
0,beautiful keyboard automatically recognised by windows the charge port is type this charging wire is accompanied with the package update it can be charged and check the ammeter only current flow in to the keyboard need to connect the charging cable when use the keyboard 
1,this is the rd pair second through this account have bought and all three still work great my and year olds use these so you can just imagine the wear and tear they receive on daily basis and they work great little bulky on my youngest kiddo but it works as intended and has been durable 
0,usb part broke inside of computer hardly used 
1,this keyboard looks and feels really nice it nice and quiet and like the rainbow color display don game much so can really opine on its quality there but imagine the feel and reach of it is nice for those that do although that big enter button might throw you off little bit if you re not used to the layout kept hitting the insert key instead of the backspace from time to time have screen display two are daisy chained monitors using displayport and one is tv using hdmi noticed that in its regular position on my desk it seemed to type fine on screen have somewhat delayed buggy input on screen and perhaps due to the distance between the dongle and the tv no response on there moved the dongle to the keyboard to the top of my tower instead of the back side but it still didn accept any input from my keyboard when wasn even feet away from my computer to me that on top of not seeming to properly respond to my other screens is large drawback for wireless keyboard especially when paid for it had cheaper logitech that worked just fine for about feet and only got this one because it died three years later to the day and that model seems to be discontinued want to like this because it works great when it wants to but the problems ve had just in the first week aren worth what paid for it almost never return anything but think gonna have to with this 
0,this mouse is almost unusable because of how loud every scroll is took the top off to make sure there wasn something stuck in there to create this awful sound and it was clean just poorly designed cheap wasn expecting the greatest mouse for this low price point but this is just obnoxious 
1,we went on long vacation so worked part of the time having meetings in the car the people on the other end were able to hear me and not background noise from the road even in torrential rain was also able to hear them clearly it was exactly what hoped for 
1,just love it all the time
1,my son uses school issued chromebook for school work and hates using the touch pad to navigate the mouse so we looked into wireless mouse and found this one had so many good reviews unfortunately the scrolling wheel has already broken and he has only used it month since he only uses it for his school computer it mostly stayed stored safely in the carrying case he was not rough with it and it was stored carefully when not in use am really disappointed because he loved the color and paid for this with his own money earned helping his grandmother over the summer at campground there is an email on the bottom of the mouse that says lifetime replacement but have tried twice now to email them about it and it keeps bouncing back as undeliverable am sure this has been great product for many and we likely got the dud so am not telling anyone not to buy it but am sharing our experience for others to consider 
1,this thing almost caught fire melted port and cable now could have got dud get it but this is unacceptable period even contacted there customer support and what joke they did not take it serious at all pretended to transfer me to another dept and hung up on me please buy something else 
1,i love these they are great gaming headphones and amazing in general for gaming they are very handy 
1,came fully charged out of the box used it to hours day delivering mail and packages when time and the route allowed sound quality is great for single speaker that is trying to be stereo speaker would like to buy another to link them for stereo but don need that right now bought the silicone or rubber thingy that is its protective case recommend it for obvious reasons but it really helps keep the damage down if you are going to use it in violent environment like postal carrier truck listening to xm or your playlists on your phone has very little effect on the battery used it to charge my phone once not bad but your phone isn gonna charge fast all in all would buy another one the sound quality is good enough to want to link of them together and btw they are waterproof to limit read the instructions not fan of the app kinda useless unless you want to link units or there is soft firm ware update 
0,great little mouse it does not tell you that it is about to die though and you have to plug it in to charge it no batteries which will slow you down if working or gaming with it

0,they enter key is one extra key over to the right and you can hit it with your pinkie while typing if you actually know how to type
1,the sound quality on this is wonderful it is directional so it won do sound but music sounds beautiful with rich and full bass the battery life is fantastic perfect for an all night party or all day event it comes with the capability to charge any usb devices you may have it is little on the heavier side but still is portable enough to put in your backpack or basket on your bike very satisfied 
0,i waited while to leave review tought it would last but it didn it was really smooth and long lasting battery little did know while using it it would become apart internally the scrollwheel broke usually fix my electronics easily sometimes things just need little adjustment but this part broke and with no fixing maybe some of you are lucky and doesn break easily mine did and not even weeks of using it

1,it very nice wireless mouse very quite the color is very nice too like it so much
0,cute
0,this is the fifth item purchased on prime day that is as good as trash cheaply made poor quality not easily adjustable definitely not noise cancelling 
0,the metal piece that is attached to the chip on the ubs broke off in my side brand new laptop talking about being sick
1,the audio works really well on my ps good quality and definitely worth the buy only issue is the light cable is too short and is an issue for console players 
0,this mouse worked just long enough for me not to be able to return it not sure what went wrong but it just gave out and that was it 
0,bought it in september stopped working after few days they sent me replacement now it february and it totally died so sad use it at work 
1,i brought this speaker as surprise gift for my daughter who has had the bose companion speakers which she enjoyed for years but it was time to upgrade to bluetooth this is our first experience with jbl so did some comparison research between jbl and bose of which we ve had various products over the years the sound is great color beautiful and size perfect begin using it as soon as unpacked it initially thought the charge cord or guide were missing due to the separate packaging being camouflaged in the box black on black should be reconsidered maybe sticker could be added otherwise we are very satisfied with the purchase 
0,it was working fine busted it maybe times max and it stopped workingit looks to be charging but isn when placed into on mode the red light flashes and goes off right away 
0,doesn hold charge for very long has dead spots have to shake to get to move sometime

1,this mouse is great it connected easily to my windows laptop as well as to my girlfriend imac love that the clicking is quiet think will get another one so we can each have one the lights are cool but am glad there is switch to shut them off that is actually great feature 
1,my mother loved it
1,best speaker ever
0,it not damaged the cord isn messed up but bought it and today it already done lol if connect it the sound doesn fully come through like as if you have to keep adjusting the cable like an old school broken ipod the mic isn working bc of this terrible would have rather bought another brand same price don buy 
1,used mouse for less than week it will not hold charge used for less than hours this morning after charging for hours and it now dead but when it worked loved it it was light quiet and very colorful 
0,sound lags from time to time
1,great stereo easy to bring anywhere and waterproof
0,it barely lasts few hours before having to recharge it which is annoying think it is because of the led lights which drain the power 
1,i think they are good especially for the price but wish that they were more adjustable they are great for sitting up and listening to tv or gaming but if you want to lay down or have them adjusted to your head they are not good they feel bulky and don quite fit to my head for someone with slightly larger head they may fit however with them not being adjustable think my problem would be flipped if someone with really large head put them on as they are not adjustable also the two connection types with one cord hanging all the time is just huge bother and it is definitely design flaw there should be some way to tuck the unused connector up so it doesn dangle and become nuisance sound noise cancelling and upright use is all good though gave it because of these factors 
1,i loved this little mouse it looked great it felt great in my hand the wheel was nice for scrolling the battery even held charge for what thought was reasonable amount of time would categorize my usage as light moderate use and no abuse then came the day about month after arrival right after the return window closed that it started glitching now it drops off not responding then will work again then drop off again and not talking about sleep mode this is during active use back and forth back and forth it frustrating probably more because so desperately want mouse instead of my laptop trackpad all that said didn spend whole lot of money on this mouse so get what pay for just wish had gotten little more than month before the glitching 
0,worked great for less than month received in april and broke today may no clue what happened went to use it after taking break for few hours and it just fell apart and not able to put it back together 
1,i read the other reviews and it seems great fully charge mine and it last few hours if the charge lasted this would be good mouse have to rate mine one 
0,the battery life on it is crap you have to recharge it every few hours it not worth the hassle when it charged it also has some pretty bad lag or just doesn move the cursor the way you move the mouse 
1, love that the colors change it perfect haven even had to charge it since got it 
0,i use these during my conference calls at work always clearest one on the call when tell them how much they disappoint me

0,very good
1,great product quality 
0,all good 
0,i really like this wireless mouse love the changing colors and the rose gold is gorgeous my only complaint is the the usb to connect to your laptop is very hard to get out always need some sort of tool to get it out ergonomically since this review had me rate it it perhaps little too slim but don game and light laptop user so doesn bother me that much otherwise would buy again and put up with the pesky usb when travel 
1,i listen to everything from podcasts to classical rock and metal on this speaker it has great full range including an impressive bass response the treble is pretty directional and the sound isn hi fi for critical listening very happy with the small size and portability can carry this thing around the house or back yard and have my music wherever go overall very satisfied 
1,works good for the price little tight on the ears after wearing for few hours seems like they ll take bit of breaking them in to get comfortable

1,i love this mouse so glad went wireless makes my desk so much more organized 
1,good for playing music
1,the mouse is great the install was very easy just plug it in and it is ready to use love the changing lights on the mouse if anyone wants led wireless mouse this is the mouse to purchase 
1,this mouse is very quiet when you click and is ergonomically comfortable 
1,i use this for pc gaming and listening to music on my phone yes little old school lol the color is great and the design is very appealing to gamer like me you ll like these 
0,this is really ball to use it does exactly what the description says change colors slowly and continuously also it has two modes color change or battery saving single color but the battery lasts for hours and it is as easy to recharge as cellphone in fact you can plug it into usb outlet on your laptop or whatever and it will charge in no time the only problem have with it is that occasionally the cursor on my laptop will jump from one side of the screen to the other or from bottom to top etc have no idea why that happens and it can be annoying which is why stars instead of 
1,my grandson love it
1,i got this for my son for his birthday and we are very pleased with the quality and this price point you can beat it great product 
0,it works okay in the first couple of minutes and then the cursor starts to jump other than moving smoothly as the mouse moves also clicks often fail to work at the first button down sometimes several clicks need to trigger an action threw it away and ordered other products 
1,love it 
0,you get what you paid for lol it worked great at first but the usb receiver stopped working after months so the mouse couldn connect to mac at all tragic
1,my son loves them so do hes able to talk with his friends while playing its clear what he hears 
1,perfect for game nights
1,it works fine the lights are little dim but that not big deal for me really wanted it because it looked cool it wireless and my old key board was pretty noisy this one looks cool but it just as noisy an english teacher and use the computer during study hall it still makes lot of noise in quiet room 
0,nice sleek design however does not hold the charge for long it frustrating when the computer is turned on and it doesn come on after switching it on 
1,i love the color options it very sleek and feels good in the hand battery life is also plus my kid uses it to game and for school been using it daily since christmas and only charged it once definitely recommend 
0,it works well but wouldn call it quiet which is shame because that the main reason bought this product 
0,cleanest bass in the bluetooth speaker out of tried tried the doss bose soundlink jbl flip jbl charge and megaboom out of all these the jbl charge had the cleanest bass and clearest vocals without distortion at large volumes 
0,this mouse is so hard to use that scrolling my documents with the keyboard arrow keys push the left button times it might place the cursor select the word or do nothing depends on the mouse gods if you leave the mouse arrow over the cursor when you finally get it where you want and if you type nothing happens this thing is trash buying logitech mouse to replace 
0,use these everyday considering another set to gift 
1,love it great keyboard at great price don hesitate to buy it 
0,was decent first month very flat so not ergonomic but that personal taste issue is this is already broken the scroll wheel no longer works even for mouse that pretty pathetic since ve had other mouses for years at time had the same issue as other reviews with the cursor randomly jumping too so there might be some design issue with the sensor 
1,i love the size of the mouse and it is so smooth really like this the design is great on the hand would recommend this mouse 
0,these noise canceling headphones do not have hardware and software that is actually known as noise canceling in them it merely refers to the fact that the headphones go over your ears and do minimal job of blocking outside noise these headphones do play noise and it does have microphone but if you re looking for something that has actual noise canceling tech in it look elsewhere 
0,the mouse worked fine for the few minutes got to use it the usb charging cord was missing per the instructions you cannot use any other charging cord with it 
1,stopped working after few days of use on brand new laptop will turn on but does not function properly lags however great the first few days 
0,it was good for the three days before it diedbad product or quality control at least it was not expensive 
1,great for gaming
1,it does what it supposed to do works as wireless mouse beautiful color and works like charm 
1,so easy to use and fits perfectly in my briefcase 
0,there something wrong with this mouse and see not alone if leave it alone for like minutes it stops working and can be woken back up ve tried powering it on and off unplugging the usb charging the dang thing just decided not to work any more returning 
0,speaker stopped accepting charge after two weeks continuously shutdown after minute of use returned accordingly 
0,great quality earmuffs are soft but after awhile they get uncomfortable would be better if it lit up without having the usb plugged somewhere so if using with controller don count on it lighting up unless can plug the usb cable somewhere
0,liked the color choices and style
0,i work in fast paced setting being able to un dock and move needed something small to transport this fut my need actually bought two may buy more for my team 
1,love everything about it recommend it 
0,awful
0,waste of money only worked for week then died left it alone for few days thinking maybe just over used it cause it was cheap 
1,the speakers sound amazing and the two that purchased immediately paired using the jbl connect app my only concern is that neither charging door closes tightly or seals shut which makes me believe that they wouldn be waterproof since water or liquids would easily enter the usb ports 
0,fully charged it still started cutting out within an hour of use and now doesn connect at all 
0,people could barely hear me no matter how close the mic was to my face
0,advertised as compatible with the switch then you get the product and the instruction booklet says mic isn compatible and it not the mic will not work when using with switch sent back and finding something else for my son 
1,this mouse is sleek and has great feel it doesn require batteries so it is great mouse to have the led light is an added bonus 
0,broken and flimsy on arrival
1,bought this to replace my old jbl flip was hoping that going little bigger would bring some better low end but disappointed nice looking speaker connects easily but was looking for better sound this seems to really push lot of mid range went with bugani for half the price it bigger than the charge but the sound was way better in my side by side comparison 
0,i ordered this in early june and really enjoyed the fun color and sleek design however now in late july about months later first the usb transmitter broke off and got stuck in my laptop and then the mouse itself stopped charging and no longer works guess you get what you pay for look elsewhere 
0,overall this keyboard is good connects fine lighting is pretty cool keys are comfortable very very light and doesn take up too much space on the desk however it doesn remain charged at all even after left plugged in overnight the keyboard dies after being unplugged it still works okay but the battery life is extremely disappointing 
1,this wireless mouse works great it light and connected right to my macbook air with no problem 
1,i ve owned the beats by dr dre and it bigger heavier but cannot compare in any way to the jbl charge the bass sound is excellent the size is perfect and convenient to carry from room to room when you re doing housework bluetooth is strong too the only reason didn give it stars is because it doesn have remote but totally blown away by the sound quality 
0,the mouse no matter how much charge it no longer turns on or connects to my computer normally try to avoid making negative reviews but this is honestly not worth the money spent on this all wanted was mouse to help me work on my macbook and this was just huge disappointment 
0,i bought this mouse in late feb and the scrolling wheel has stopped working in july the body is made of what look like cheap materials bought it but now can even find the seller to ask would not recommend 
1,impressed by some headphones my only gripe is the mic is on the left side of your face and you cant rotate the mic to switch it to the right other than that happy 
1,inexpensive but the quality matches those of way more expensive mouses also this mouse has led lights which is very nice will definitely be recommending this to my friends 
1,i was looking for replacement mouse as my old mouse stopped working properly when ordered this first received mouse that did not work properly it went into sleep mode every few seconds requiring me to switch it off and back on in order to work again for few seconds contacted the company and they sent me replacement which works perfectly 
1,i love the color and how slim it is use it for work school 
0,works well 
1,this is good product good price
1,bought this item for birthday gift he been using since no problems 
1,the mic is good and the sound quality is also good 
1,bought this for my husband and it was so easy to connect to bluetooth no apps required and the sound is terrific better than expected in this price range 
1,i love the product excellent for my year old son 
1,i generally don give five stars unless it something extremely love but this little bar of sound is totally awesome amazing extremely worth the money this tiny little bluetooth speaker is amazing it super small but the sound is pretty loud it very portable and you don have to constantly be charging it even at max volume we have two big sony speakers that can light up party they re also wireless but they re extremely heavy and take up lot of space and they are way too loud for public reunions so we decided to get this jbl portable speaker and it was the best thing we did it portable because we could take it camping to the beach or pool or lake and the sound is great and even if you drop it in water or juice it continues to work amazingly 
1,for me this keyboard is perfect am not hardcore gamer so those that are mihht have different opinion but for the gaming do it works amazingly the keyboard charge lasts long time the lighting is good not to bright but lights up all the keys beautifully love the keyboard 
0,after months of somewhat daily usage just for checking emails occasionally or something fast the middle wheel stopped working making it pain in my ass to use would recommend staying clear since it only has day warranty 
0,stopped working stopped chargi stopped lighting up contacted customer service and they sent out replacement that showed up days late new one we shall see 
1,i love using my charge great battery life and use it almost everyday excellent sound quality 
1,i have it for my personal computer and it has worked out great
0,the tracking on this mouse is not great and to add insult to injury the mouse stopped working after about months worse yet missed the return window by days 
0,after few months of use obviously past the return window the scroll wheel on the mouse does not track any scrolls and spins almost like wheel on skateboard the led also stopped working if were to purchase again it would have to be considerably less with the frequency have to buy them 
0,i am enjoying my colorful mouse however my mouse connected to the computer of someone else while in use during class have also been having trouble connecting to my personal computer when am by myself 
1,i think this mouse is great love the led colors changing it goes to sleep after little while to save battery life it very simple to charge if it ever needs it my only thing about it and it not even negative about the device is that my hands are very big so this seems little tinier than like still though got no complaints about it 
1,it pretty good 
0,i don like it
1,honestly the soft push of the keys feel weird maybe because used to laptop keyboard with very shallow keys and friends boards with more clicky keys it doesn feel satisfying to type with connectivity was super easy and the lights are nice there is slight buzzing sound from the lights however 
1,my son loves his new gaming keyboard and thinks everything about it is great noticed that the product was reasonably priced and arrived promptly my son recommends this to everyone who likes gaming 
0,listening music videos
1,great product
1,i use mine for gaming on the xbox and love it 
0,it took one week of using this mouse before deciding to just get better quality mouse 
0,i ve used this product before and had no complaints this time purchased it charged it and the next day tried to use it and it wasn turning on at all tried to charge it again and the same result returned immediately 
0,good head set
1, ive had for about year and only used it on occasion it worked pretty good until started using it on regular basis mouse slowly stopped working more and more until now it doesn track any movement at all do not buy unless you want to throw away
0,omg what piece of crap can right clock seriously looks great did like the slimmer line of it too bad don work 
1,really good sound very comfortable and there just nice
0,i really liked the idea of rechargeable mouse but the wheel button stopped working after days and it is needed for my job and the programs use guess got what paid for 
1,pretty solid keyboard quiet and nice feel to it seems to be constructed well 
1,i like this headset really do after about an hour of wearing the headset it starts to hurt my ears little bit not that the volume is too loud but maybe because have big head and big ears for the price the quality is great the seller did everything as promised and shipping was on point 
0,was deciding between this and ue boom went with the boom first and it just didnt have that deep bass and sound personally like but this charge does night and day on that battery im not sure yet haven ran it more than hrs at time but so far no issues glad got this one
0,i brought this mouse for my work computer and it works well
1,nice gaming headset for cheap mic works great sound is great and the options to use for xbox ps or computer is pretty sweet my only gripe is the noise cancelling isn anywhere near bose beats or jbl and if you have pumpkin head like myself it houses big brain for gaming duh this headset can be little uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time overall stars and buy again
0,it broke literally less than month and ive never even dropped it super disappointed and waste of money 
0,i ve enjoyed this mouse for the most part it everything it mentions in the description however my scroll wheel just randomly broke after only month of using purchased the mouse for work purposes and the scroll literally broke during project 
1,so far pretty good my only complain would be that the microphone is too far from my mouth it makes it hard for other people to hear me 
0,good headset first one was defective but was able to get replacement right away it not too loud but the headphone itself does cancel out all surrounding noise and have small head and it very spacious
1,not having to change the battery is what drew me to this but it goes to sleep to save power and is hard to get it working again thought the slim profile mouse would be ok and better for travel but it is too hard to hold thought it might just be my big hands and gave it to my wife she gave it back and said it was hard for her to hold on too 
1,just bought this mouse and was really excited to use it but even after charging for multiple hours the mouse will turn on briefly and then immediately stop functioning just goes to show that items this cheap often are too good to be true save your money and buy better mouse 
1,everything is good but the keys would look better with light color light it means on the left side blue purple mixes up with black color of the keyboard makes the contrast less appealing it works great on the right side though with green light blue there is no yellow though that would be better 
0,the headphones stopped working correctly within month sound only in one ear 
0,stop working after few days do not buy this mouse 
0,stopped working very conveniently after return window had closed 
1,its very good comes with lights to spice up your gaming setup and works with any console pc laptop higly recommend 
1,really disappointed wanted to love this product but the usb adapter that came with it doesn fit into my usb port it looks like it only goes half way in so basically the product is useless the mouse itself was pretty and easy to manipulate wish the adapter worked
0,this keyboard may look cool but that about it the keys are not button like like the one brand normally use so typing with average size nails is difficult it makes way too much noice for my comfort am returning the product because it doesn meet my expectations 
1,i like how smooth it is it moves across the screen easily the buttons click nicely my hand doesn hurt after hours of gaming the sleep mode is great perk to save charging time overall one of the best purchases ve made for myself in long time 
0,bought or two month before christmas just wrapped it and put it in the closet my son opened them christmas day and was excited but when he went to use them they didn work and it was to far past to return them was very disappointed 
1,great looks with surround sound
0,the only time cant hear anything is when have it on full volume
1,great speaker nice sound

1,i ve been jbl guy since the shows my age guess my experience with jbl has been great they make great speakers that provide the best sound for the buck in my opinion that said there are so many choices today for speakers many more than years ago it can be difficult to choose if you are looking for great little bluetooth speaker with great sound you can do no better than this jbl charge it pairs very easily and quickly with whatever source iphone or ipad in my case the sound is terrific for such small package other blutetooth speakers have tried can compare in sound or reliability use it on my patio and the range and volume for the area are perfect battery seems to be real plus am still running on the first charge it also rated very well by consumer reports you can go wrong with the jbl charge 
1,i was wary of buying no name brand mouse but it turned out to be even better than expected it super sleek and looks great with the leds it also functions very well the clicks are almost silent if you ve used cheap mouse that has loud clicks you ll know what talking about haha and it very reactive use it for light gaming and it perfect haven even had to charge it yet which is amazing absolutely worth it for the price 
0,works as described 
0,received first time and it was not working exchanged and the mouse started acting up after few weeks 
1,the mouse is nicely shaped and feels nice in your hand the clicking is quiet the only problem is that it does not stay charged more than one day so have to keep it plugged in which defeats the purpose of having wireless mouse 
1,i purchased this headset on wednesday and got it by friday really fast which was great now the sound is really great better than the one currently have im glad made the switch 
0,i purchased this months ago for work at home really like everything about the keyboard accept the letter quality as you can see by my picture within months the letters have started to rub off it has the backlight but it doesn matter because it lights the key and not the letter so you don know which key it is unless you have them memorized next time would pay bit more for double shot laser etched

0,stopped working days after the day cutoff for returns it worked great while could use it but of course this is unacceptable won buy from this seller again 
0,sound quality was so bad just bought razer you get stars automatically if have to use two in between wires engineering genius lets add more jacks usb which is the weakest link of every headphone in existence honestly you might as well pay for wireless then all this chinese crap that is gonna break in few months of wear and tear

1,use it lot listening to music on social media sometimes can be little muddy in sound but that may be the audio system from the social media site otherwise very satisfied there may be larger brands out there at much cheaper prices than the jbl advertising strong bass but the tonal quality of these cheaper speakers is not that great 
1,the product arrived in an undamaged box with the details of the keyboard on the back upon opening the box there was the keyboard small envelope and user manual in several languages the keyboard had the wireless connector in the back and power switch to turn it on inside the envelope was note on how the shipping was processed along with branded stickers the keys on the keyboard all work very well and do make nice clicking noise overall am very happy with this product and would be happy to get other products from the same brand

1,i have had flip and clip before bought the charge the sound quality is always great battery life always seems to last longer than need and it always connects with no problem the clip is usually in my bathroom clipped to the shower rod and the charge is great for larger outdoor parties or to have sound throughout the house find them esthetically pleasing and they blend in to my decor while giving great sound this charge was on sale and got it for less than can beat that for the quality

1,quick and easy set up just unbox and plug into usb port then game away charging cord is little short but it does has samsung charging port not sure what type it is maybe so getting longer charging cord is no issue no lag between key presses and was shipped in good sturdy box with stickers and personal note from company 
0,after turning it off it powers back on by itself it will not stay off power cycles all night tried resetting and still does it 
0,packaging was damaged and looked used 
0,i bought these about year ago and when received them they appeared to be fine but when used them the cord is heavy thick and tugging the worst part is that if you ever take off the black wrap around the cord the cord will dwindle and tangle until it decides to do it until it permanently damages itself used them for about hours one day and never touched them even though they were annoying and noticed in video clip saved the microphone cut out randomly but audio still coming through the headset and was confused because never did anything to damage them so they eventually damage themselves by tangling asked my dad to get me another pair of headphones and told him not the same ones but by the time they had already arrived it had been the same and he didn realized that he bought the same pair but figured give them another shot once again they tangled themselves to death one day and realized how cheap this company was and how terrible their products are and how cheaply made they are if there is anything in this review you note down do not but these headphones the worst part is them tangling beyond repair and the annoyance of the excess weight to the cord quite embarrassing for the company to own such terrible product 
1,has this headset for over years and have no complaints super comfortable so you can wear them for long time with no irritation nice click for the mute feature if you re like me and need to check if you re muted or not this is the headset for you

1,of left unattended for while sleep mode works fantastic also great for gaming 
0,i use this keyboard with my gaming laptop only when not using my gaming desktop the keyboard is quite nice and responsive but the battery dies very fast use it maybe mins day and it dies in week would much rather have less backlighting and aa batteries can swap out hate when it dies in the middle of game and then have to plug it in and wait while it charges 
0,it is almost perfect escept the assembly gap is big some dust dirt tiny food waste will go in easily
0,bought this portable jbl speaker for my son worked well for week and stopped will not recommend
1,still can believe how good this product is for the price ve been using this headset for the past couple of months and it is solid 
0,horrible bought key board and within hours it stopped working amazon was great and replaced the keyboard the replacement lights do not work 
1,i liked everything about it but the jack the braided cord separates from the plug pretty easy so if buy maybe reinforce it in advance otherwise great sound lightweight comfy and worth the buy
1,kids love it they use it to play on ps the sound quality is good and like that the headphones light up 
0,works okay kept going to sleep on me even while just reading webpage for too long and would have to turn it on and off again easy to navigate and like the design but it was pain keeping it on

1,loved this mouse but it breaks super easily liked it and figured give it another chance so bought second one and it broke after months it soft to the touch and very quiet which liked unfortunately both times the scroll button stopped working feels like it detaches you get what you pay for 
1,the charge is awesome great sound awesome bass and jbl connect can link up to speakers and that any model jbl speaker that has the jbl connect waterproof is really nice bump tunes in the shower and not worry bout messing up my speaker also purchased silicone case that has strap and now can carry it over my shoulder really convienent for when ur out and about like the beach outdoor event etc the only problem have is that it doesn have microphone microphone have the charge it has microphone use the charge on calls all the time can be doing other work in room and still have fluent conversation with no hearing issues that big deal for me the sounds hair better now if it only had mic 
1,i like the simplicity and sleekness of this mouse along with the changing colors everything works fine so far 
1,nice upgrade from my st gen charge which still works perfectly as well 
0,no carrying straps
1,this is the best mouse super quite and small love it so much the colors are fabulous 
1,great quality and good bass for speaker it size
1,i sucker for colors and needed new key board this one is it not only do like the colors in the background but the comfort and style it was great buy
0,a rechargeable cordless mouse is such good idea and invention you don have to deal with batteries and this mouse seemed not to need recharging for over day great this one bought worked well even though it did something odd and am not sure if it was the mouse or the inexpensive tablet computers that use or maybe the usb splitters that use however it was probably the mouse but after using the mouse normally for few hours the mouse would then not show the arrow on the screen and found that would have to turn off the swatch on the mouse and then turn it back on again it was as if had to re boot the mouse periodically it seemed to have nothing to do with recharging this would happen even after the mouse had been fully recharged it would be unpredictable as to when it would happen but overall even that was minor flaw but then one day actually the date of this writing march put the mouse receiver into different receptacle to use different tablet computer and it would not work no matter what tried to do then decided to take out the receiver from the usb receptacle and found that the metal square part on the receiver stuck into the usb receptacle so this leads me to believe that possibly the mouse receiver became faulty with regular use over few weeks since bought it otherwise the way that the receiver was made was not in the best possible way not rugged enough maybe however though don know at this point if this is the way that all these rechargeable mouses are this brand or if this particular one that bought just did not actually pass quality control at the factory it seems the company should give me replacement am going to see about it but guess will be told that the deadline for returns had been reached will update if am able to 
0,scroll wheel broke weeks into having it and stopped working not even months later 
1,works really well plus it looks nice great price too 
1,these headphones are pretty good for gaming especially at the price recommend getting these if your not trying to break the bank in downside in my opinion is how big the volume control is 
1,this is the coolest mouse ve ever had sleek modern high tech and sexy lights everything slips in my briefcase with my new ultra thin laptop sweet 
1,this is for gaming for my son and he loves it 
0,i really liked the lights on the headset
1,when received there was mystery liquid on the number pad chose to assume maybe it was cleaning fluid of some sort wiped it off and moved on with my life its supposedly water proof per advertisement right keyboard works fine while plugged in and has quiet keys but will not hold charge advertised as bluetooth and has bluetooth connector but only working as wired keyboard at this point and the backlight is super dim even at the highest brightness maybe mine was faulty but personally do not recommend 
0,bought it for my husband during prime days he uses them for gaming and says they work well 
0,at full volume the in game sound is still not the loudest for the price it good headset that will last while 
1,this is great cordless mouse it is rechargeable as long as the computer is on there is place on the bottom to store the dongle if not in the computer if dropped it will come apart unfortunately it does fly in special education classroom stronger shell would be great also an extra dongle in case you lose the first one 
0,i had high expectations and it exceeded them all 
0,my son has been using this for school for just under month and the usb has stopped registering so it can be used anymore
1,i bought this wireless mouse for my classroom so that could click around on my smartboard without having to walk across the room to my desk each time sounds silly but it saves me lot of instructional time the battery life is great and only charge it about once week even with me forgetting to turn it off before go home each day sleep mode for the win 
1,is amazing 
0,haven even used it yet and won keys are all very loose and extremely cheap feeling but for the price it was kind of expected the most disappointing thing about the purchase is the way it was shipped ordered multiple products including few heavy tv mounts which were of course on top of the keyboard and my led lights ups was upset about the weight of the box and told me not to ship heavy items because they will be broken when they arrive if you must order this keyboard make sure you don order anything else at the same time 
1,bought it for my granddaughter just because she was very happy with it and arrived on time and undamaged would recommend to friend or family member
1,the headset itself is great but the chord is extremely long and to get the lights to work it has seperate usb so wouldn recommend for console 
1,bought for my year old son and he absolutely loves it 
1,got this as birthday present sounds quality was ok but the max sound is not very high could also never get the mic to work even after about an hour troubleshooting would not recommend to other buyers spend few more bucks for something better quality if you plan to game often 
0,horbile never worked be careful they fool u
0,very nice sleek design was expecting lot more given the reviews but mouse stopped working after weeks the usb and usb adaptors are very flimsy and prone to bending so as soon as go to plug it into my computer it does not connect definitely would not recommend unless you are looking for product to use for about week or two 
0,i must admit bought these due to price have found they do not cancel exterior noise at all as am able to hear the tv and conversations very easily while wearing the headset would also note that after minutes or so they tend to be painful and am forced to remove them 
1,smooth and comfortable like the feel of ease while using definitely recommend this mouse
1,i originally bought this mouse for my gaming pc and it works great it smooth and easy to use without wire would also recommend people get pretty big mouse pad so you have room to move it makes everything better
0,this stopped functioning after one week of use 
1,absolutely amazing take it with me everywhere 
0,return back in days the st day it doesn work how did you make it 
1,this mouse is very useful and beautiful colors thought it wouldn fit my mac but it came with mac adapter very convenient and cute too 
0,pros wireless ease of use feels nice soft smooth sleek dampened click quietcons it has very loud scroll button the wheel works fine but the button is difficult to press down and is quite loud so it slightly defeats the purpose of quiet mouse no additional buttons such as back or forward additional you have to charge the mouse with the included usb charger
1,i have no regrets or complaints about this item
1,so light and love it being rechargeable
1,i love the color options it very sleek and feels good in the hand battery life is also plus my kid uses it to game and for school been using it daily since christmas and only charged it once definitely recommend 
0,speaker is defective it won charge 
1,for its price the headset worked very well although the design is quite flimsy and the earpieces were bit too small the sound quality was very good and it worked as intended 
0,less than months after receiving my keyboard it stopped working the on off switch on the back of the keyboard seems to have something to do with the problem the keyboard stopped working couple of weeks after the return window closed so was referred to klim directly long story short klim never resolved the issue despite the fact that this product has warranty sent about emails before giving up would definitely not recommend the product when purchased the keyboard was excited about the features described but if the product doesn function then those features are useless note didn have any problems with the amazon seller 
0,it connected immediately with my computer and makes no noise and like the ergonomics on the mousei can move my mouse faster than my other mouse
0,listen it does the job of keyboard but the multicolored lights are fixed you cannot make them go white so at times it actually impossible to see the characters on the keys if you re dealing with the glare of monitor

1,color shape size weight everything is okay but stopped working after few months update reviewthe seller has sent me new mouse and this is working fine really appreciate the gesture 
0,this wireless mouse is very light and thin it can be used for long time after charging didn read the instruction at all just plugged the receiver which is hided at the bottom of itself into the usb port of the markbook air and it began to work normally it quite easy and quick to get start 
0,this speaker is built so horribly ive had it less than month and since the second it was delivered it was broken the speaker will not turn at all unless its plugged in once on none of the buttons work and you cannot turn the device off unless you hold the power button for minute and even then it randomly makes noises but then once its off again you cannot turn it on unless plugged in eveything about it is broken and frustrating do not waste your money and no they will not offer to fix send new one terrible
1,its really light weight and you don hear the mouse clicks however the usb blutooth is located at the bottom of the mouse didn have tough enough finger nails to pull the usb out logitech has their blutooth in the mouse where the battery is located but this didn have visible battery so used the tip of knife to pop the usb out almost nicked my hand from the blade getting the usb out you may do better job than me

0,mousewheel doesn work yikes

1,hubby got this as bithday gift as an avid gamer he fell in love with it the mic was great and canceled all of the background noise including our month old crying 
1,i didn need the lights and everything it pretty annoying as the mouse wanders quite bit and won always listen to where you re trying to go 
0,the microphone worked for under an hour randomly just stopped working the first night got it hopefully this was just random dud and getting replacement will be better 
1,so pretty and super quiet
0,i plugged it in and let it charge over night was so excited to use it becuae though it was so cute did not work from day when turned the power on it would flash red then would try to use it and nothing zero zip nothing would work waste of time buying it waste of time trying to get it to work and now waste of time having to return it so very disappointed
1,this mouse was purchased for year old girl she loves the colors the fit and the fact that it works without making noise 
1,this cheaper yet good quality head set use it for gaming and it works well the mic doesn work well on pc but that ok because don use the mic one side of the headphones stopped working at one point but just had to unplug it and plug it back in 
1,i like that it recharges and doesn require batteries it doesn last that long though but seems to recharge good enough after only being plugged in for even minutes wish it came with longer charge cord since you could then use also with charging cable plugged in still can but very short cord 
1,it lightweight works great with really decent battery life don use the lights mode though which probably helps 
0,i purchased this in july and it worked perfectly it now ass backwards you have to hold the button down just in order to move the cursor if let go of the button it does nothing its completely off track the led only works when it charging before it worked whenever it was on the last switch on the bottom of the mouse 
1,the bass is really good when listening to music great for gaming it for me 
0,laptop slipped of my lap and obviously landed on thw protuding hardware troubling as have much to do ive not acustomed to the finger pad 
1,this has great mic and noise cancellation
1,it seems to work fine so far the lights around the side are constantly red until well charged but then they rotate very easy to set up but does not seem to work when wired 
1,i use this everyday in my postal truck carry it in the rain charge it once week with one or two out of five battery life lights left sound quality is excellent and pairs to my phone easily use it to hours day definitely one of the best portable speakers ve owned
1,has worked great until now charged it and now it won turn back on can return it either not worth the money 
0,does not work with the ps and they are not well made the ear ad came off almost right away and they don even work well with the computer in order to have sound you need mm jack which the ps does not have the usb seems to be power source for the brilliant blue lights don recommend these at all the lights are nice but not worth it since they don do what they should 
0, bought this on sale at target because needed it at that moment great sound quality just disappointed it mono and not stereo 
0,easy to charge and to use 
1,my husbands bday present he loves it the sound is amazing
1,the sound quality is amazing you only hear the gameplay and it can light up 
0,for the price maybe is an option but first received keyboard broken send it back and they sent me replacement but after week of use this bs stopped working so bad quality material too just bought dollar keyboard cheap sh like this just will last for month or less 
1,best speaker dollar for dollar on the market 
1,this is good quiet keyboard bought it because my wife and share one living room which is also where write on my laptop keyboard noise was driving her nuts bought this wireless keyboard because it was advertised as quiet it really is quieter made it even less noisy by putting piece of towel under it that has really helped my marriage survive during the pandemic cooped up together the keyboard lighting is nice prefer lighted keyboard since sometimes wake up can sleep and start writing another chapter for book that may someday be bestseller the keyboard charged up easily with the short usb cord included the charge usually lasted one to two weeks between charging even when forgot to use the switch underneath to turn it off for the night when the battery died the keyboard was instantly usable again as soon as plugged it into the laptop have just one small grumble writer not gamer when typing fast want large enter button on this keyboard it is little smaller in order to make room for backslash key find myself getting lot of backslashes instead of new paragraphs this happened with different keyboard few years ago which threw away due to aggravation for this quiet keyboard however the configuration is not so aggravating for now its quietness is terrific other than the extra backslash key the keyboard action is nice feels great can write for hours when not interrupted by my dog hope this is helpful for someone be well 
1,it very small really enjoyed the sleek design of it but think ll have to give this to my kid yeah the padding is soft but very firm maybe my ears are too big cause it hurts to wear after long period of time max hours the microphone isn great for what wanted just too soft spoken of person for this to work for me probably cause the mic is stiff and can get it any closer to my face this purchase was learning experience for me 
0,product quit working after return window of one month closed
1,my son loves it 
1,as woman in today society it is hard to find the time to clean and cook but now having speaker that plays my audio of choice it definitely helps to motivate those actions can wait to clean next saturday this is awesome it can go any where with you and is water resistant hhello shower concerts simply hook up your bluetooth device to the speaker and your ready 
0,the lettering on the kb is so faint you can see them unless the backlit is on problem is you can turn auto dim off which means you have to hit key to wake it up if you can have it backlit when you reach for it when gaming it utterly useless in dark room does it work for the price yes does it work for gaming nope not at all 
0,works well
1,i definitely love the sound on these headphones and they re very comfortable which is ideal if you spend hours gaming overall very good quality and good price 
1,this mouse works well for my needs and fits in my medium sized hands well this is the first mouse ve ever owned with built in rechargeable battery and now don ever want to own one without it the small form factor is also nice for packing up and taking on the go another nicely designed element is that the nano receiver tucks into the bottom of the mouse and doesn require prying off cover or any extra effort to remove or insert 
1,very comfortable and durable makes gaming better compared to other headsets used to headset for gaming on games like cod blackops cod warzone and fornite helped me hear the opponents better and allowed for better gaming experience 
0,be ready to turn it on and off every mins of non use the thing goes into sleep mode then is sluggish in its response time till you restart it not something would reccomend
0,the mouse doesn work now and am outside the return window disappointed beasue like the feel of the mouse and the sleek design
1,it nice sleek mouse and works relatively well until it stops charging had bought it early march this year and now early may it won charge making it hunk of useless plastic buy with the expectation you will have to buy again and not very long thereafter 
0,worth it 
1,works really well plus it looks nice great price too 
0,it works very well with my macbook
1,speaker sounds great battery last forever
1,i love this mouse for the most part the colors are vivid and it feels nice in my hand the only downside is that the right click has tendency to stick even when am only using the left click ve had it for few days now and that the only negative 
1,i like the quality of the sound is is amazing have not tested the water proof ability of the speaker yet but am sure it is workink the battery could be improved 
1,i liked it because there is light and feels comfortable and good when you wear it and it looks cool 
0,easy for my year old to set up and use after weeks the wheel broke 
1,i have had this keyboard for well over month now it is cordless and rechargeable the great thing about it is that when the battery needs charge can plug it in with the supplied usb cord and still use the keyboard while it is charging the keys are backlit with the light coming through each keys letter not just around them the lights turn off after short time of non use but light back up with the tap of any key would buy this again without hesitation if needed 
0,quit working after weeks of use
1,love the overall look love how it can light up for when play at night the noise cancellation is awesome really great product invested in
1,my laptop has terrible sound quality and produces sound super low both from the speakers and other headphones but these amp the sound up so that can actually hear without straining my ears and they also help with noise cancellation as my roommate can get loud at night for certain reasons if you know you know but if put these on won hear thing they don stay on too well if you move your head around ton normal movement is fine but abrupt jerky movements make them slide bit still would definitely recommend them 
1,i have used many different jbl speakers including the extreme and honestly these littler ones are way more worth buying then the big expensive newer ones love my charge 
1,this is still stars because description is correct and perfect for price nothing else will beat it best for laptop pc gaming but bought it for ps console so the lighting feature won work because the usb cable is not long enough to reach the console while also having the auxiliary plugged into your ps remote what you can do is have phone charging battery pack with you to have it power up the led lights lol that what did
0,i don write reviews very often but will make an exception for this piece of junk were you wanting wireless keyboard because this is not wireless it requires usb cable for power oh yes indeedy and so now you are using not one but two of your usb ports for this bs what waste of time
0,small doesn respond well
0,i was not expecting that sound quality for this low price
0,i ordered silver and received black not worth the time to return it but bit disappointing quality functions as expected
1,i bought this to play music to my daughters they enjoy to listen to their favorite songs here the sounds is of good quality and fills the entire living room in our home believe battery runs for about two days when we listen to music all day recommend it it is the perfect size to take it on trip 
1,received product on the th charged it and started using it the charge didn last that long maybe day at most but today it doesn work at all glad kept my old battery one 
1,this mouse is sleek and cool looking it fun to use and everyone is envious of it because it lights up best mouse have ever got want another for my desktop use this one on my laptop best buy for the money and so cool too 
0,works beautifully has same problem all head phones have how long before the cable snaps and the jack falls off took some tooth picks and electrical tape to make sort off splint around the jack confident it will hold if you have the same problem with head phones try that method stars 
0,light weight no lag great value
0,it quit working after less than months ugh it no wonder they only have day return policy 
1,updated used to be stars now find the lighted keyboard distracting but when turn the light off can see the characters on the keys had to buy stickers for the keys so could use the keyboard without the light on this hopefully will help my second issue which is having to recharge the thing when it starts misbehaving wireless ought to mean no need for wires would prefer batteries easier to replace batteries every couple of months than to recharge every week otherwise the keyboard is fine update the mouse in this combo became laggy after about month taking second or two to respond when used it that lag has increased to the point that today am still waiting for my cursor to respond an hour after booting up new battery made no difference useless ordering different brand today 
1,this was great purchase would gladly buy it again if had to 
1,this is great value mouse purchased it to go with my new laptop so didn have to depend on the trackpad the design is nice and colors are great addition

0,wish hadn missed the return window on this one this mouse does not have range of meters as stated it has difficulty tracking at just meter or even couple of feet away this was supposed to replace mouse from another seller that also had trouble with it turned out to be the same exact mouse it disheartening to find out that multiple companies are selling the same useless products would recommend spending little more money on mouse from reputable brand

1,great for gaming and sound quality is great comfortable and easy to wear 
1,it has really good noise canceling very good for hearing footsteps while gaming overall great product for sound quality 
1,sounds great and is very portable
1,very good headset the surround sound is really nice and they are great at noise cancellation
1,it good keyboard with caveats in order of personal importance the key layout is different from the typical keyboards ve used in the past years the backlighting is dim at its brightest and goes out quickly maybe there way to make it persist till some timeout period the keys are tad squishy but otherwise they feel okay
1,i like the silent clicking and the smoothness and the ergonomic design but the wheel doesn scroll anything on the computer the wheel will move but won scroll anything on the screen 
0,literally bought it today it connected at first and upon turning it off after and turning it on it did not want to connect at all gave it full charge and the battery only lasted up for min very disappointed

1,this mouse is great ve been using it for month now and really love it was little unsure about the lack of battery power but the charge holds for long time ve only had to charge it once with daily use highly recommend 
1,works great but don like the lights going on when turn came computer on but does not go off when shutting down
1,i didn know it was possible to like mouse so much it is very comfortable and smooth the battery life is pretty long don like having to charge it because sometimes forget to plug it in and then it goes dead the battery life usually last around week as long as can remember to charge it it is fantastic 
0,i charged the mouse overnight and it died within minutes of using it tried to charge it again and it will not charge threw out the box so can return it 
1,i love this mouse use it on multiple devices and it uploads fast like it how sleep mode would kick in if you haven used it in while however it is easy to wake up as well like it how you can switch between solid red to rainbow colors its quite and moves smoothly did mention love it 
1,i bought this for my daughter who received new laptop for christmas she loves the led lights it was easy to set up and use works wonderfully 
1,awesome bass tested this speaker at my local electronics store and then bought it here didnt test the waterproof ability cause generally rather not do that satisfied 
1,i love using this headset for gaming everyday it is good deal for the low price to the quality of the headset recommend buying this 
1,i am very disappointed with this item had replaced it once and the same thing happened where it doesn hold charge after few months of ownership really like this product but the cool rainbow changing lights can only be enjoyed when its charged and working properly 
0,waaay to light flies off desk at angular touch and there is nowhere to grip if and when you want to move it without touching key and messing up processes 
1,this headset is one of the best have gotten for my son very good sound with noise cancel hes pretty rough on his things and these are sturdy enough that they have held up nicely love these 
1,ordered this for my new laptop works like charm includes charging cable adapter and usb receiver that can be stored in the bottom of the mouse the colors light up very nicely and customer support was lovely contacted them about activating warranty my only issue with this mouse is the shape which was more flat than the mice used to using but that is just personal preference and got used to it very quickly overall great product 
1,package arrived very quickly keyboard was charged when got it and just had to plug in the dongle and it worked just fine keys are soft but not too much so and pretty quiet the multi color backlight looks cool very happy with my purchase 
1,thought these were good deal volume out works great however the mic is an out of box failure no one can hear me at all tried on pc and xbox my old headset the cord was chewed in half by our cat held the wires together on our old set and people could hear me better than with this set do not buy 
1,the good part about it is very convenient and it saves lot in batteries and you can still use it when charging to the laptop also the lights lets you know when is time to charge it like it lot
0,nunca funciono
1,i like this headset lot because it helps me out lot with gaming and just using it for work it is really comfy and when it comes to gaming it is nice headset to use give this ive had this over months now and it is really great product nothing bad happened 
1,as said before got this for my mom for her birthday because she always uses my grey charge and loves it 
0,i tried to give this mouse some time tried it on different surfaces in all cases it skipped around and was very hard to work with unfortunately because of vacation and because tried to make it work missed the return window by one day that just frustrates me even more 
1,the mic is easy to use and have good mic quality my friends say that they don hear any static or background noises the earpad are very comfortable on my ears though so if you have sensitive ears the headphones wont be an issues the sound is good quality which is need for games like apex and cod in conclusion good headphones for the price and will definitely buy again in the future 
0,and it only wireless half the time the other half you ll have it plugged in and charging because charge doesn last very long that why they give you that little short charging wire that plugs in the front of the mouse that makes it hard to use when charging everyone knows it easier to drag chain up hill than to push it up well everyone but these people update the battery has completely gone dead it won even take charge anymore after only three months you have to keep it plugged into your laptop at all times and even then it goes dead occasionally if you use it too much or too fast you have to wait to seconds for it to charge just so you can use it for another seconds it even worse than the star rating gave it originally 
1,i like that this mouse has sleek look to it slim ergonomic good quality not cheap looking like the color options available very easy set up ve been using it for couple of weeks now and it works great have not used it for gaming great price and will likely buy my next mouse for different computer have from the same place 
1,no problems and work great
0,no complaints nice nice head set
0,stopped working already 
1,excellent for gaming incredible noise cancellation and great sound quality feels like actually in the game 
1,this mouse has been the best one that have ever used would purchase this again the fun part of the multi colors is another reason to purchase it again
1,definitely steal at dollars love black friday specials the jbl charge is just the right size to get good audio and still be able to take it on the go have the flip the extreme and now the charge and this charge is my favorite this speaker has pretty long lasting battery while not being huge and unpractical it has power bank feature but to be honest never use it the sound quality is amazing this one has lot more bass compare to the flip 
1,i feel like won this out of cheap gumball machine plastic doesn feel like it going to last long 
1,easy to use great on the hand good product 
1,this speaker has great sound quality and connects so quickly to my phone have used it lot and haven had to charge it yet

1,nice mouse worked great for my needs glides smooth holds charge well 
1,i bought this to replace logitech wireless keyboard used to control my htpc from the couch about feet away the logitech was not lighted and the signal was not very good from that distance this klim keyboard has completely reliable wireless connection and hasn missed keystroke yet and love being able to see the lighted keys at night the battery is pretty decent as well lasting around days before need to charge it again with heavy use it comes with usb charge cable that you just plug into any usb charger or pc usb port to charge the built in battery the only slight negative is the layout is iso vs ansi and takes bit to get used to overall highly recommend this keyboard 
1,typing speed increased makes me happy was struggling with logitech keyboard that held me back from typing my usual wpm very happy with this klim chroma keyboard 
1,i bought this for my year old son he loves it and uses it everyday haven had problem yet would recommend 
1,a great headset for gaming
0,easy to charge with usb cable lasts longer
1,easy to use great to go wireless 
1,i love this speaker great sound super durable and long lasting 
1,the only complaint have about this headset is the cord it gets very twisted up guess it the material wrapped around the actual cord idk but besides that for the price it great headset 
1,i really needed mouse because it is so much easier when working from my laptop searched on amazon and came across this vibrant mouse fell in love and decided to buy it it was the best decision because this mouse is fantastic and works perfectly love the color variations and the sleek look it is easy to setup use and also easy to charge it is also wireless which makes it even better 
1,i placed it under gentle stream of water and it continued playing 
1,my son law loves it 
1,works great love the quiet clicks perfect for school without being the annoying one when everything is silent
0,the voice not as high as excepted but it did the jop liked the design didnt like the yellow shade though 
0,beautifully produced and lovely to look at for mouse the lights are welcome addition to an otherwise drab workspace did notice that it tends to go into sleep mode quickly but takes longer wake up time than expect on screen busy with windows the cursor freezes in position until the mouse fully comes back to life it frustrating for anyone who isn patient 
0,the mouse only works if directly next to the usb port it is plugged into so it is useless if using it foot below on keyboard tray the instructions are not in english to try and troubleshoot 
1,we were using an amazon basic mouse and after couple years it broke we upgraded to this mouse and my teenage son loves it he uses it at school with his laptop and loves how the colors light up under it 
1,jbl always great product this is the rd one of their products we bought and love them great sound even in the smaller ones always priced right 
0,very good for gaming
0,using the type port as its plug in method does not work while plugged in my computer does not detect or accept the plug in if this is your main use in mind do not use it 
1,got these for both the hubby and kiddo they are pretty great 
0,i like this mouse but the battery literally died in day charging it now see how long that takes say 
0,this worked great at first but have to keep it on power or it will only last about hours after about months 
1,product loos great and it feels awesome however am experiencing huge issue when it comes to the keyboard not responding to me typing have to turn the keyboard off or plug in usb cable to it and sometimes it still acts as if didn enter key this is very frustrating ve checked to see if it was device drivers anything that not updated on my system manufacturer website etc still experiencing this issue does anyone know how to resolve this if so this product would definitely receive tar rating 
1,very good product sound quality is amazing
1,awesome product great for gaming 
0,doesn hold charge for even full day 
1,loved it 
1,so pleased with this device have had it for few years now and am constantly impressed by it sound quality is so good bass is strong when wanted and the battery life is unbelievable would highly recommend to others 
0,its so quiet and you dont have to click so hard its going to save me from arthiritus
0,this product has to be plugged into the xbox and controller at the sametime to work it has about inches of cord making it impossible to play any games 
1,i work from home and this mouse is very comfortable and responsive 
1,love this speaker
1,i like the sound quality my kids love it perfect for playing video games recommended
1, love it it so easy to handle give it out of to ll go for the for sure 
1,these headphones are comfortable and the noise cancelling is great the sound quality is also very good both through the headphones and through the mic the only issue is the wires it impossible to use the lights through the usb and plug in the headphone jack at the same time on my laptop because the usb and headphones inserts are on opposite sides and the wire isn long enough which is really irritating when the actual wire is very long and its just the split wires part that too short the extender they give with the product also seems cheap the sound through the headphones with the extender is completely messed up to the point of it being unusable none of these problems are with the headphones itself so still gave stars but it annoying that can use every feature included honestly the product is solid stars 
0,it works fine just seems little cheap and not real comfortable

0,only lasted hours when fully charged quite disappointed with this product overall 
0,right out the box you can hear perfectly but couldn be heard it said my microphone was on and making noise but no one could hear me did not glow blue at all cord was already lose and when you move it sound would jump and go in and out
1,love the mouse my only downfall is that it very light and used to little heavier one so it something to get used too 
1,arrived just like the picture lights aren as bright but they re pretty either way good sound haven tested mic yet
1,this was great mouse for schoolwork and better then using battery mouse
0,this was absolutely the worst headset ever received had bought the adapter and plugged it into my xbox controller the sound was so far away even on high volume the quality was bad it looks nicer in the picture than it actually is would not recommend this item at all
0,i bought this at the end of april and it already acting up have to move it in certain way for me to hear it
0,well worth it doesn disappoint 
0,i was very disappointed when the mouse stopped responding after few weeks of using it
1,pretty good for price works
0,stopped working within the first week of use
0,not the best quality ve seen but for the price it ranks pretty high 
0,has cool look and very comfortable but after just few days it stopped working it sucks because ordered this head of time for my son for easter and unfortunately the return window has closed so out and my son has no headset 
1,beautiful speaker love the dark green color the sound is crisp and clean just wish the volume would go just tad higher but that not really an issue 
1,great product
1, great product love the color and the sound quality is amazing perfect for gaming 
1,the scrolling wheel doesn work my daughter was so excited to use this but it won scroll other than that cute mouse 
0,nice
0,the wheel from the mouse not working anymore it only lasted for about months really nice mouse but doesn last 
1,comfortable and lightweight sound quality is pretty nice and bass is deep volume also not problem definitely as loud as you need 
0,careful it not bluetooth had to order my daughter new one an kept this one for myself 
1,the mouse is amazing you can pick out diff colors and love how it glows rainbow greatest purchase ever 
1, and differently from the alienware saved about dollars love the fact you can switch the leds off to save battery also good battery is rechargeable although in about weeks never had to charge it yet good quality and fun to use also awfully cheap which is always plus not sure if is good match for gaming ve used it in the new ms flight simulator and must say the response was fine not sure though if it would be fast enough for the kill em all gamestotally recommended 
0,i have two problems no matter how long you charge it for it dead in an hour that if it been works the usb plug in takes two people to get out and afraid it will get stuck and ruin my computer the appearance is great but it doesn work and could break the usb port because of this do not recommend since this posted the company offered to change review instead of just sending another mouse clearly they know there product does not work 
0,it had worked very well for me for about years and it very aesthetic 
0,this mouse is very quiet like it says in the description pretty the only thing worry about is it is very lightweight the quality seems cheap but it hasn proved that yet will only use it for office work so hopefully it will not wear out or go defective 
0,i purchased this keyboard in may and it now july use this keyboard for gaming so do use it quite bit which is why purchased it in the first place going off the reviews already having keys stick not working which shouldn be happening since ve only had it for less than months it worked great up until this last week but guess going to have to look into another keyboard now 
1,i bought it as present for family member but seem to have adopted it sounds great solid quality feel and look easy to connect and good range of connectivity ve only had it month so can attest to longevity may have to buy another one for myself 
1,my jbl speaker didn receive the charging cord or the carrying case that was suppose to come with it could and would you please send those two these to me thank you 
1,very light and sturdy keyboard that has some cool rainbow key lights the lights do this cool fade in and fade out effect 
0,this mouse is just trash it lifespan is days stopped working just days after the return window closed don recommend purchasing if you want something that is actually functional and long lasting getting tired of amazon allowing vendors sell junk without recourse 
1,my granddaughter loves it 
1,the sound quality is great but no matter what configuration of setting change on my council it still sounds like am talking from across the room the pickup on the mic just isn great 
0,i wanted to like this keyboard but months old and it dead battery life wasn anywhere near the advertised time be prepared for dead keyboard after couple hours playing time 
0,this mouse is ergonomic light weight and very easy to use unfortunately the color shown in the picture for rose gold was not very accurate it is much darker would still buy it again though 
0,battery only good for months only lasts hours now
0,the keyboard is very light and doesn feel too cheap but it never detected on my dell computer not sure if it my software windows or the keyboard but it would light up and then go dark when tried typing on it the manual didn explain anything because the keyboard is supposed to automatically be detected and work my other vic mouse and redragon keyboard work just fine returning for refund will stick with my wired for now 
0,loved this mouse at first had zero problems with it however now it will not stay on it has charged over night but as soon as take it off the charger to use it it dies it will not turn on and am not able to use it guess you get what you pay for 
0,beware this mouse did not hold up it wouldn charge correctly after week had to return 
0,the mouse is cute and light but it doesn consistently work throughout the day it will be working and then all of sudden it will be non responsive and has to be turned off and back on to get it to work again would not recommend 
1,i have tried charging this mouse with the original cables it came with did not charge then tried multiple cables and power sources already owned still did not charge left it plugged in for hours while was away from home come home to an uncharged mouse the blue light stays on for about seconds before shutting off the design and price were what attracted me to choosing this specific mouse would recommend spending bit more on quality mouse that can serve its purpose 
1,love this speaker can use it anywhere and in multiple ways great buy 
0,good
0,the different colored lights stopped working after week and it only had red light after two months the mouse stopped working entirely sucks because it too late to return it
0,it is hard to use and the sensation is not good 
0,after months the jbl charge will no longer take charge this is pretty frustrating issue as it new device we ve only used handful of times there are lot of articles about it online but fixing it is difficult for someone who not familiar electronics and there lot of trouble shooting involved 
1,highly recommend can believe waited so long to get one of these it game changer when listening to music great quality 
1,best speaker have ever had
0,it not the best nor the worst it just ok 
1,i ve had this mouse for less than month and now it won work loved this mouse at the beginning never had problem with it and it was super cute now it turns on and everything and is also fully charged fyi and it won move at all on my laptop just when need it for huge work project and can use it bummer 
1,needed wifi mouse for my hp chromebook liked the fun lights and the price was good set up was quick and easy via bluetooth works great 
1,first off this keyboard has been nice to type on considering the price at first the keys were bit too soft and required slightly more pressure to press but as typed more on it they loosened up and now feel great the keys feel clicky but soft enough where it not loud to type the space bar is bit louder but not as loud compared to other keyboards works great as an external keyboard for my windows and mac laptops do wish the max brightness of the keys was higher as it not as bright when the room light is on also it would be nice to have the option to change the colors of the lights like other keyboards that are around the same price range or cheaper lastly it would be slightly less annoying to have the option to use the media keys without needing to press the fn key for macs on my macbook pro with mojave was able to change the settings to where the ctrl key functions as the command key on mac you simply go to system preferences keyboard modifier keys and ensure that the correct keyboard is selected on the top next to select keyboard for me it was wireless receiver once the correct keyboard is selected changed the control key to command and changed the command key to control now the ctrl key functions as the command key however the windows key functions as the command key by default so these steps are not necessary if you re okay using the windows key overall would recommend it if you re on budget and don mind some of the drawbacks mentioned still great keyboard and battery life is pretty good 
1,i was surprised to find out how well these actually are they handle bass very well and the audio is clear and loud you can have the lights on or off and they look pretty cool if you re looking for good quality headset without spending lot of money these are great option 
0,its just literally not working at all charged it for three hours and connected the usb to the adapter and plugged it in to my macbook and it just does not work have turned it on and off put the usb back in the mouse and tried again and again and it just will not work instructions were absolutely useless since it just said to turn the mouse on and off 
0,this product was great when got it it was rgb however was expecting to be able to change colors this part doesn matter as much as the rest received the item jan th worked up until the morning of used it every day not sure what is going on with it as can flip the power from off to on and the red light flickers but doesn come on 
0,it barely works went back to the mouse was using when bought this which is on its last leg and it works better still skip this product 
1,i bought this speaker for any social events might attend and work work at fast food place and we love to listen to music as we clean up the store after close this speaker is perfect and actually loud especially for the size love this speaker to death 
0,i bought this mouse for work and gaming the first one that arrived broke within the first week of using it the scroll wheel broke returned it and got replacement now the scroll wheel on the replacement mouse has broken and the return window has closed if you re looking for wireless mouse do yourself favor and spend little extra for quality that won break after month or two

1,i bought this keyboard so could see the keys as write in the evening and at night this lightweight soft keys keyboard has great backlighting with multiple colors that flash the light gently in the background as you type when the keys are not in use the backlighting turns black off therefore sparing the user the time it would need to charge it there is also an on off button that is optional as well am able to use this keyboard swiftly and quietly with no problem

1,that is perfect thank you 
0,i love the clicky ness love the backlit lights but extremely upset that got keyboard usb plugin for bluetooth yet no cord to charge the keyboard came with it there weren any instructions just keyboard and plugin may have to return it so can set the time out setting on the lights very frustrating and waste of time

1,really amazing sound for the size my living room is about and it rocks it 
0,sent back
0,box was open and the mouse was dirty like really it looks used and has so many gross black hard spots 
1,this speaker has been nice upgrade from the standard dollar speaker you can get anywhere the sound is rich and it does have good bass can why others stated some of the voice gets drowned out at times but enough to deter me from not buying this speaker overall the sound is great and can get decently loud the color got was sand and it looks great one thing that does not make sense to me is they dont give power cord dont recall the last time ve spent this much on an electronic that didnt come with accessory that is as important as that all in all like it and very pleased with my purchase 
1,this is the best wireless keyboard ve ever bought know ppl complain about slow response of the keyboard but if you change the settings for it you ll get better results my boys play games on my laptop and this keyboard responds quickly to all the commands required to play the games amazing keyboard for an affordable price love the colors love the fact you can change the intensity of the glow 
1,i like it it very comfy and the ease of access is wonderful the sound is wonderful 
0,i use this for occasionally gaming with some buddies they constantly complain they can hardly hear me ve only used the headset few times and microphone does not work well wish could return but beyond the days 
0,bought this to use for my mac already on big sur turns out the mouse is only compatible with x
0,i bought this speaker for my boyfriend for christmas and the bluetooth button is already broken 
0,junk bought it for my ps and apparently you have to have the usb and headset jack plugged in for everything to work 
0,this is good for its price but if you want quality look for some higher costing ones 
0,good sound
1,klim chroma rechargeable keyboard is great don use it for gaming so cannot address that but for regular typing and daily usage it can be beat had defective key and contacted klim their customer care was superior and they truly value their customers replacement was promptly sent after few questions highly recommend klim for not only their products but for company that stands behind their products and that values their customers have purchased two klim keyboards and would do so again if needed to purchase another one 
0,it didn work for my xbox series put in the adapter and still didn work 
1,i got this mouse for friend and he loved it very sleek and the colors just overall look amazing awesome purchase 
0,very good
1, stars because like others experienced left ctrl shift does not register with all keys guessing they didn map all of those or something alternative use is left ctrl right shift if you don use this key combo often then this is fantastic product 
1,very comfortable and not too heavy as most over the ear headphones can get warm after while good sound quality 
1,i like too much this product great sound and good connectivity battery lasts forever

1,this thing gets loud it the best of both worlds because you get something light and easy to carry but still get amazing sound battery on the beach goes hours consistently and we like our music loud also like that my wife and can both sync our phones to it at the same time and switch from phone to phone with my old speaker we could only have phone synced at time and we always had to go through the process of disconnecting the current phone then re sync the new phone by putting the device in find new device mode now it simple process to turn the bt off on her phone and mine will automatically connect because it already synced vice versa to connect her phone back to it

0,i love these its comfy and works great downside is can have the volume max on xbox live chat and hear other noises but if in game then it fully cancels noise 
1,compared to bose and its prices this one is half the price but as good as the bose nothing to complain 
0,i got this keyboard because the crappy logitech wireless keyboard my office gave me was not as responsive as would like this keyboard is very responsive since it is technically gaming keyboard the keys are quiet except the space bar which makes click sound but it nothing major and is less noisy than my old keyboard 
1,works great and has excellent sound

1,love the color for sure liking the noise cancellation and the sound quality 
1,the best
1,i have no complaints about this mouse use it daily and it works great love the fact it has led lights recommend this product 
0,started off good about weeks in it wouldn move fully charged 
0,this headset is complete garbage the usb plug wouldn work only lights up the headset using the audio plug the sound is staticy and you can barely hear at full volume listening to music video to test the sound was chopping cutting out the artists voice all over the place worst headset have ever used opened return immediately 
0,im giving this because got one in black for my sister and she hasnt had any issues bought one in blue and the left click sticks not sure if it was dropped at some point prior to me receiving it or if there is inconsistent quality with the product at the price its not worth the hassle of returning it to get replacement 
1,easy to use lightweight and comfortable to the hand 
1,it pretty much works like it said it would wish the ears were little bit more comfortable better than that 
0,i like this mouse however after one week of use the scroll wheel broke 
1,this was my second purchase bought one in june and it worked fine the charging port metal liner part fell out so it couldn be charged got another and used it for about an hour without any problems charged it used it for another hours then it just suddenly quit when turn it off and on again the red lights flash once then nothing completely useless 
0,very good
0,made for people with giants heads who like really hard headphones 
0,this mouse is very slow in reaction not sensitive to the movement and make my hand tiring already after minutes usage too bad only start using it after the return window closed 
0,just spend the extra money on mouse that will actually last you more than two uses highly annoyed
0,like
0,works well when charged nearly impossible to charge though the port connection must be off 
1,works well my year old loves it for fortnite so he can chat with friends while playing 
1,nice size comfortable good battery life and plug in play 
1,i bought this mouse for friend he she loves it it is better than the mouse that comes built into he her laptop plus it was brought as replacement for it as for my friend she tells me that she loves that it saves her lot of money on batteries she also loves the cool extra lights it has features on it 
0,playing games get extreme key lag would not recommend it horrible keyboard tech support is bad too
0,i ve had several of these headsets over the years good product used daily 
1,usb doesn go all the way into the port it doesn work at all the headphone jack works for controllers but the microphone sounds like garbage it sounds staticky and muffled

1,they won hold charge
1,my son is happy with this headset setup easily and sound great 
0,we live the jbl flips small and large sound so much better and are louder than my bose mini sound link 
0,don waste your money on this mine stop working within the first month of having it 
0,noise cancelation is what my grandson liked
1,i love this worth this money 
1,amazing speaker honestly my only beef with it is that it doesn get quiet enough 
1,has nice feel to it very smooth and responsive like the changing lights around the edge very colorful 
1,the price of this mouse was cheap and you will get just that with this product it serves its purpose ok like the color changing led lights but this mouse is too lightweight for my liking and my hand is too big to fit on the mouse comfortably it feels like there is lag when moving the arrow just an overall not great feel compared to my mouse on my work office computer 
0,liked the colors and style east set up but after about weeks of use the scroller stopped working and fell off track only used it few times out of those weeks 
1,great keyboard comfortable wireless transponder is solid haven had any connectivity issues charges quickly can be used while charging as long as the charging cord is plugged into the wall not computer 
0,the keys are very buggy in response takes hitting the keys several times in some instances for them to work keyboard goes into sleep mode seconds after you hit key so it is constantly turning off forcing you to jam the keys to get them to work again it is pretty and the company sends you cute emails after you buy it but just garbage product overall have had to buy new keyboard just days after purchasing this one as it id border line unusable
0,mouse worked fine for two weeks shape took some getting used to since it low profile charge held up pretty well but the scroll wheel broke after few weeks of use so in the trash it goes 
1,great sound and comfortable
1,this mouse changes colors so tweens would get kick out of it love the sleep mode as it saves energy purchased the gold mouse and its very classy looking like the fact no battery is required and ve only had to charge once in day period 
1,this mouse worked great for the days it worked tried turning it on today and it wont light up or connect to my computer tried connecting with the cord provided but still wont work sucks because the outlook of the mouse was cool along with the led outlining 
0,this is how the box looked at my door not in box just the product box all smashed and bent looks like it was used was supposed to be gift but now am embarrassing to give it to them 
0,did not work at all with my dell precision laptop 
1,so far it works great
0,it very slow at connecting that one clicks on sometimes you have to tap few times to get it to connect 
1,the wheel roller makes click vibrations and makes scrolling take longer would love it otherwise 
1,really great keyboard gamer and have had zero issues it has quick response time can tell the difference between this and my wired razor black widow keyboard my only feedback for the company would be to provide some sort of indication software or hardware based of how much battery life there is 
1,this is great mouse to have if you are trying to have mouse that can be used on type only device while keeping the option of normal usb open love having it light up and it cool thing to have in my office if you want to use the type port it will need to be attached via adapter the adapter will stick out unfortunately so be careful as you can damage the adapter it does have slot so you can install the dongle not the adapter to the mouse itself the default plug is just normal usb port the mouse feels pretty nice it does feels pretty smooth there is no real lag or drifting with this mouse it does have built in battery which is super nice you are able to just recharge the mouse by plugging it directly into your laptop via micro usb was able to use it for quite some time before the battery died and initial charging only took about hours it does have sleep mode from what can tell to save battery life when you are not using it but it does have an on and off button if you need it the mouse moves pretty well across most surfaces and clicking is pretty responsive im not gamer so can give any recommendations on that the led light works pretty well with the color you can adjust the color via the center button the bottom has pads but they are not the soft silicone like pads it feels like hard material this is plug in play and works great with mac and pc it does not look like it has way of adjusting the dpi but it has pretty good default dpi already so do not see the need to adjust it overall think this is great mouse 
0,i has purchased one of this items but unfortunately it just stop working without reason it still looks on and connect to my bluetooth device but it doesn make any sound and unfortunately it looks like there is not way to fix or to be replace from the seller
1,beautiful 
1,it is very comfortable and does not hurt ears like others do 
1,it soft click which like love the colors and truly get about weeks of using it as my work mouse 
0,i use these headphones for my at home job as well as gaming and often get complaints from my customers that they cannot hear me actually bought these headphones to replace different pair of gaming headphones and do have less complaints about my audio with these headphones but even just one complaint is still pretty bad 
0,got of these they work really well but it has to be plugged into the usb in order for it to light up which is stupid you can use them on controller without also plugging the usb into something else but great for pc 
0, the ergonomic feel of the mouse is great and the battery life is amazing it is lightweight and feels cheap white matches my setup but it translucent and takes way from the aesthetic it is connected less than ft away and it still loses connectivity which causes it to lag it makes it completely useless to me don recommend you buy it at least not the white one and be aware of the lagging 
1,good sound and fit the extra hook ups for other counsel 
1,i like this mouse very much it moves smoothly and is small so there is no discomfort for my hand the only thing do not like is the on off switch it is very small and hard to make it move 
1,super
1,provides the best sound quality and noise cancellation for their price highly highly recommend
0,it does not bring the wall charger as the charge did minimum cost for manufacturer but big problem for the consumer hope they are not trying to put quality down in all components as well 
1, just opened it and connected everything and couldn be happier with them was skeptical but this headset couldn be better and the price made it stars for sure 
1,great sound 
1,inexpensive but the quality matches those of way more expensive mouses also this mouse has led lights which is very nice will definitely be recommending this to my friends 
1,these work great good shutting out noises they sound great you can tell the suround sound good bass only down side to me is they seem to be made for laptop cause the the usb cord for the lights is super short for controller use you could put one of those power bars on it button it just hangs there other then that great buy
0,won stay charged 
1,use the charger cable in edge of the box inside thin black box that looks like spacer do not use an apple macbook charger with its usb cable does not charge when connected to apple macbook charger with its usb cable sound quality and volume are great this speaker does barely squeeze into my bicycle bag that mounts to the handbag on my bike but after put the speaker then pack extra bubble wrap inside the bag because the speaker to round and tends to rotate while ride my bicycle when the speaker moves so the buttons are in the down position and hit bump on the trail then the speaker turns off 
0,mouse comes with converted bracket to convert your usb slot to regular usb slot so you can use it but the parts stick way out and are ungainly 
1,i use this on my playstation this is the best headset for gaming that have ever used great product 
0,i have my computer in the living room with the midi connections attached directly to with this wireless keyboard can now use my computer more effectively 
1,love it and works great good purchase 
0, 
0,stopped working in about an hour 
0,this product only lights up in red not multi colored as described or shown other than that that it okay 
0,they are very comfortable to wear and cancels most of the noise around stylish and practical for gaming 
0,i ve had this wireless mouse less than month and the wheel of the mouse has already broke not to happy with this mouse won buy this again
1,i got tired of using my laptop keyboard and decided rj invest love the led colors with the mouse although rarely change the settings love that don have to switch batteries and all have to do plug it in could tell after about week including me leaving my mouse on few times that it was time for charge my mouse began to lag and went ahead and plugged it up also the color of the mouse matches with the picture well
0,mouse only worked half the time then never held charge 
1,i like that you have the option to have the lights pulse in and out or keep it solid the keyboard does go dark if you don touch the keys energy efficient say the best part is how quiet the keys are definitely worth the price update lost the usb receiver for the keyboard and contacted klim directly they sent me new usb receiver for free amazing customer service from this company recommend 
0,usb receiver broke inside my son computer when he tried pulling it out the reason he tried pulling it out was because the mouse wasn responding this happened on the st time ever trying to pull it out he had to use tweezer to take out the broken piece now none of it is working 
0,nice
1,like design look feel soft touch silent click sleep feature single click to wake it up dislike it loses the charge bit quicker than prefer but works welledited from original review would recommend
0,this keyboard does not work properly am not sure if mine is defective or not but reading other reviews can see that other people have similar issue would be in the middle of typing sentence and it misses about of the letters in the sentence it appears to be battery issue the keyboard barely charges the blue light for charging turns off within minute of plugging it in and then minutes later the keyboard starts being unresponsive again and you have to unplug it and then plug it back in for it to work again properly 
0,mouse works great when you first plug it in but if you wait few minutes it will lag so much your better off using the laptop mouse disappointed in these high reviews because mine does not work 
0,the first one had defective charging cord connector very loose and the replacement sent promptly starts fine and gets steadily slower and more and more draggy and must be turned off and on again to start working normally both were returned under warranty and won be reordered again neat but not good quality 
1,my favorite thing about this mouse is how smooth it feels to the touch the colors are great addition and add to the experience of using it it feels sleek as you move it on mousepad and all other surfaces and textures the customer service has been splendid they replaced mouse for me and helped answer questions when inquired about getting replacement usb receiver they were pleasure to communicate with no complaints
1,i went through lot of wireless keyboards but this on is right on top of themthe lights are nice and non intrusive the battery life is long and the keys are quiet very nice keyboard for gaming and anything in between 
0,bad wireless don always work
1,love
1,great sound solid design easily portable should be able to enjoy it for years 
0,wheel stopped working after return period no mistreatment 
0,don waste your money it worked well for few weeks long enough to miss the return window but then got jumpy erratic and wouldn hold charge unless plugged in 
1,likes works good for the price and is pretty good for membrane keyboard the battery seems to last quite long time didn actually time it the keyboard goes to sleep pretty fast to conserve battery life also can be con cons this is why it is cheap so the cons are to be expected for keyboard at this price point the keyboard flexes the rgb is very limited would of liked an option for solid color the keyboard shuts off even when plugged in probably the biggest downside the space bar is clacky and doesn feel as solid as the other keys if you want decent keyboard that is fairly cheap and works as advertised this isn bad buy 
1, just needed simple mouse for desktop only use for watching videos in my living room its super quiet and lightweight no lag also using it for cricut designspace with no issues 
0,works real good and last long time

0,it broke only had it month and rarely used it the hell 
0,sound very clear
0,i chose this mouse because it lit up like the rest of my accessories however the lights are so dim they are barely noticeable it extremely light weight however feel it is going to break easily since the plastic is so thin so far for gaming ve had no issues with performance of the mouse itself

0,color 
0,everything about it
0,good
1,i like how slim it is and the colors are nice touch without being distracting clicking is responsive though the movement was little glitchy for me sometimes my biggest complaint is that the usb sticks out super far if you have to use the usb adapter 
1,this company has absolutely amazing customer service ordered this keyboard and it stopped charging after about month of using it so contacted the company and they sent me brand new one right away that works wonderfully without problem highly recommend 
0,colors are fun but it doesn react great charge doesn last long if you forget to turn it off over night when it low on battery it doesn work well overall it an inconvenience amending my review to include the following if you post bad review the company hassles you by email to take it down first by offering refund when you tell them not interested they then offered bucks you can pay me to take review down that the point of review just make better product you should just refund me

0,gift for grandson
0,the mic quality is more clearer than if you were to plug your plain headphones in it more decent sound quality the build is pretty light due to plastic structure but what do you expect from dollar purchase 
1,i purchased this mouse because was tired of having to uninstall and re install bluetooth mouse was using this mouse is very responsive fits nicely in my small hand and is an excellent buy for the price the battery lasts and turns itself off after no use for awhile

1,update from stars to was having trouble with the jbl connect app but now got it figured out do not have more than connected devices at one time otherwise the app will not work once the app worked could now turn off the audio prompt which was annoying when especially you don want to disturb anyone now the start up and volume either reached maximum or minimum does not give me the unwanted feedback nice note my experience with this speaker was less than hrs also it didn been through water test just so you guys know only single sound driver could tell sound was coming from more from the right side when had the speaker feet away from me and that my preferred use that was already little unpleasant next issue was the jbl connect app didn work at all it couldn find the speaker what lastly and most importantly used my speaker lot listening to audio book before go to bed when this speaker volume was down to say maybe or so could hear random breaking up background noise coming off it that was my last draw and unfortunately had to return it what would like to is that the light indicator can be controlled via the app but since couldn use the app wasn sure if the light indicator could be off or dim somehow it is way too bright and unnecessary also if possible led indicator to show the level of the current volume it does not have to permanently turned on but fade away after second or two that will be way better jbl jbl oh no 
0,the mouse stopped taking charge from the charger after months
1,the wife needed new mouse found this one she said she liked it ordered it she loves it very sleek works perfectly usb charging instead of batteries awesome 
1,i just got it today but very happy of what it look like thank you so much

0,this was great mouse until it stopped working after about months of use mine appears to no longer charge therefore do not recommend buying this product 
0,the clear sound
1,i love this mouse and the best thing about it is my favorite color sleep mode is great thing and very colorful it must have 
1,very smooth and easy to use just good all around product 
1,its good mouse and its different from your standard mouse like the fact it lights up 
1,son loves it 
0,the scroll wheel broke after weeks of minimal use 
1,quality of sound is great yet the loudness is not sufficient per price ve heard speakers that are sold for half the price with similar sound quality and louder volume considering return
0,i bought this for my home office usually had to change the mouse batteries once in months because always forget to turn off the mouse when am not using it now with this one don have to worry about all these things just recharge and use it 
0,this is the second time buy it it has everything no need for battery you hock it up to laptop for charging and that it comfortable while holding it moving smoothly and got very appealing look bought another one from another brand and stopped working after awhile this one is the real deal and no more exploring other mouses sticking with it 
1,just plug and play so easy to use and very sleek and slim looking like it when the light lid up its soo cool this is my st rechargeable mouse really like it am going to try it for month and if it work well will buy another one 
1,i really love my mouse have no issues at all thinking about ordering my sister one she saw mines and instantly fell in love with it order you one you won regret it 
0,i purchased these to use with my ps and the sound is fine and all but it has too many wires attached to it you have wire with the aux jack that connects to your controller and then you have usb wire that you need to plug into the console if you want the headphones to light up the lights are purely cosmetic but it annoying to have an extra wire attached to the controller if it not being used 
1,nice wireless keyboard bought to replace logitech wireless kb that got banged around for the last couple of years the only minor gripe is wish there was bit more margin around the edge often hit key accidentally when picking it up it is light weight wise and the lighted keypad is great for dark rooms 
1,they keyboard works fine able to maintain connection and battery life is fine the spring or what ever is supporting the space bar can be improved feels very weak and need to make sure space bar is pressed in certain area for it to register command this is fine for web browsing or working on word documents however this can be burdensome when playing games
0,not even two weeks cord has gone bad they reached out to me and shipped replacement free of charge
0,put one star because this store sent me bad mouse twice the first was working then not working the next did not work at all just wasted time and money 
0,this mouse is junk the battery charge does not last it is rechargeable but you can use your computer while it is charging 
1,have been using it nonstop since got it the look of the keyboard is super sleek and nice love the colors and the auto shut off of the lights when not being used has type charger so it works great with your phone charger if you have an android phone keys do not make noise which is nice connected quickly to my laptop no problems at all wish the company would make wireless mouse to go with this keyboard though 
0,it was great for the weeks it lasted after weeks it would light up as if it was charging but never would hold the charge 
0,i really like the rechargeable feature instead of going thru all the batteries 
1,super load and light fits in every bag worth every penny
1,i use it to teach classroom music in some performing venues the volume is loud enough great feel in the hand convenient attractive unobtrusive design beautiful sound one drawback jbl stopped providing charging cube so you have to own one already or charge through usb 
1,overall works ok ear cushions are too small have slightly larger than average ears guess oval shaped holes for ears are width height other than that seems to work fine audio and mic worked without problem 
1,works as expected like the colors they puts little sunshine in my work day sleep mode is too quick for me but it wakes up quickly after good shake 
1,works great
1,best quality best price
1,this headset is great for gaming and basically anything else it has volume switch so you don have to bend over your keyboard to press the volume button and you can change the volume as well my favorite part is the cushion at the top my last pair of headphones were very uncomfortable but now my head feels lot better because of it and it also has headset microphone so you can chat with friends the only downside is that the cord is very long and it so it can sometimes get in the way if you re playing game but all in all these are great high quality headphones for very cheap price this was written by my year old son who plays games on pc and other platforms he loves these heaphones 
0,the mouse was working good and out of no where in the middle of me working it clicker just stop functioning unfortunately purchase this item on the th of january and my return window is now close really felt confident about this product and it is was nice while it lasted edit was spent replacement and it has given me any problems 
1,great keyboard and even better customer service highly recommend
0,he hasn complained about them so it plus 
1,love this take it on my paddle board bring it outside when have people over and bring it all around my apartment the sound quality is amazing it can get pretty loud too love that it waterproof sine spend lot of time on the lake 
1,great headphones for my boyfriend mic and audio are on point 
0,second one same issue the mouse wheel just stops working do not order this product learn from my mistakes 
1,sounds great 
1,this is the second ine purchased purchse one for me as work remotly and it was really good this one purchase it for my dad as he teaches online he loves them noise cancelling is amazing no regrets
0,it only lasted days is not worth returning it 
0,batteries really have long life before needing recharge 
1,my son recently was gifted this headset for birthday he loves it an it fits his head perfectly he says he can hear is friends good an they can also hear him well highly recommend this headset 
1,i don like the fact that the mike doesn pick up voice very well its about half the reason why bought it the overall construction is not very sturdy the plastic is brittle the leds work as advertised but it takes an entire usb port so you need three open ports on the front of the pc just to have the headphones work with features the headphones themselves are uncomfortable and not better than the cheap headset was using before the audio quality isn great pros they look cool but that about it don pay full price for these glad didn 
1,perfect size and sound for small to medium size areas drive truck and use it to listen to podcasts and music on my nightly run from atlanta to nashville and back also use it out in my wood shop like having the same sound quality in the places spend the most of my time it super easy to pair up very durable just toss it in my backpack without any type of protection and it does just fine highly recommend 
0,worked for about week 
0,i have one and my grandson liked it so got him one for his birthday
0,it very slow at connecting that one clicks on sometimes you have to tap few times to get it to connect 
0,loudness good
1,solid comfortable headset that doesn squeeze your brain cheap and pretty sturdy and quality for the price could noise cancel better better sound quality than expected perfect gift for the youngins
1,the mouse is very cute and love the colors and the way it lights up went to use it one day and it was out of charge charged it doubt this will last long it was but really worth about 
1,my office desk has slide out tray for the keyboard and this keyboard is perfect for that because of its slim design there is no wasted space had to replace more expensive keyboard for that reason and actually like this one much better the only complaint have is that the caps lock key is apparently where my fingers and brain feel like the shift key should be hopefully will adjust to that 
1,i ve been using logitech marble mice for years maybe over decade just love that you control the cursor with just your fingertips but it weakness is that the marble mouse scrolling function is clumsy and jerky as it lacks legit scroll wheel that is probably the sole reason bought this led wireless mouse the led mouse seems to function well it has sleep mode that easily wakes up and had pretty color light around it don use it for general mousing but for scrolling once get the cursor in the right window the mouse can be on the desk in my lap wherever it makes up for what don have with my marble mouse the price was right and think if it what paid for it it good cheap addition 
0,iy works so what can one say about mouse 
1,for its size it pounds out the music with surprising clairity and volume bass is astounding for its size perfect size for on the go with bikes side by sides camping and not to mention water use on the boat or beach with being water resistant solid science behind this unit worth every penny 
1,my son loves these they are definitely noise canceling because he can hear anything while gaming 
0,poorly made
1,hands down best speaker out there it water proof yucky dirt resistant can take it anywhere in the world it the best 
0,i bought these headphones and they didn last week the speakers in the headphones are already shorting out and no longer working 
1,great quality value look sound 
1,i bought this for my year old and he loved it very easy to use and it automatically goes in sleep mode if you forget to turn it off we have had it and used it for months and haven had to charge it yet 
1,i love how cute this mouse is use it for work it goes into sleep mode pretty quickly but one click and you re back up and running charge it once week 
0,well enough
1,this is our rd one they all connect together great sound and easy to use 
0,cool little speaker but jbl straight up lies when they say it connects to your other jbl speakers they advertise that it connects to up to other jbl speakers but it isn true have another jbl which is why purchased this one it does not connect to my other jbl speaker called customer service and they confirm that it will not connect to my other jbl speaker it is complete bait and switch poor customer service and straight up lies on the part of jbl 
1,wished the keyboard was brigther but all is good 
0,family time entertainment we use up battery quickly
1,decent sound quality directional sound works well mic is little quiet but you can easily fix this in settings on the windows pc am using so no problems there the usb seems miscellaneous unless you want them to light up which is kinda cool honestly lol but would be nice if the usb extension was removeable
1,this is such great mouse it works so well and love the pretty colors it also doesn make any noise while clicking which was my priority would definitely recommend this 
0,this is the second time buy it it has everything no need for battery you hock it up to laptop for charging and that it comfortable while holding it moving smoothly and got very appealing look bought another one from another brand and stopped working after awhile this one is the real deal and no more exploring other mouses sticking with it 
0,i returned this because it was consistently laggier than wired keyboard my keyboard was about feet away from the receiver and half the keystrokes would not register 
0,make sure to fix your settings on your system
0,this headset is the worst for gaming no stereo so there is no difference if the enemy is on the right or left you can hear it as one sound the noise cancellation is amazing to the point you are screaming just so people can hear you talking normal sound quality is ok besides that useless hanging usb plug for lights don have small head and don have huge head and it slides down off my ears after some time it snug for about an hour super light weight plastic junk when received them thought what was in the box was pack of masks wait and save your money and buy something that is actually worth your money for years to come 
1,i didn even have it for day it stoped working it connects just fine but it doesn turn on and doesn play music at all 
0,i purchased this for daily use although the design and colors were neat ended up breaking this is not durable mouse not usb another downfall is the light in the mouse could be blinding at times the mouse dropped once and broke 
0,easy for my year old to set up and use after weeks the wheel broke 
1,this mouse is lightweight easily connects and transports well for those on the go it being rechargeable means no searching for batteries and the feel of the mouse is comfortable and not bulky the lights are fun and you have the option to turn that on or off all in all this is great mouse with great value for the cost 
1,signal works at great distance 
1,good for the beach back yard or picnic with hour play time 
1,love this keyboard 
0,this keyboard is great the keys are little louder than like but got used to it within few hours 
0,very comfot
1,bought for my sons bday thought it was wireless he is still happy with it 
0,nice quality 
1,honestly very surprised by the sound quality the noise cancelling would say is sometimes afraid can hear if someone calls me at home and the foam on the ear cups and the head part is really soft have longer head so these burly fit me but over all am really enjoying them now to see if they last long 
1,love the vivid color it has nice feature of the lights not staying on all the time so to save the battery life love that 
0,microphone doesn work useless

0,very quite clicking 
0,performs as advertised and is easy to plug in and use 
0,this mouse doesn work well at all ve had it about months and the mouse doesn respond it drags and is not worth the money paid for it 
0,this mouse worked perfectly for about months almost on the month mark exactly the scroll wheel stopped working it just spins and doesn move the cursor up and down the page looked to see if could return but the window closed month ago don be tempted by the cheap price should have stuck to name brand 
0,i have been using this mouse for about month it had been working perfectly only use it occassionally throughout the day after about month it stopped working while it was on the color changing mode it still works while on the regular red light mode but now not the color changing mode 
1,so bought two different mouse to use one for my laptop and one for my pc the originally bought this one for my desktop to match my rgb but enjoy using it with my laptop much better it is the perfect size for my hand you cannot go wrong at this price for what you get enjoy the noiseless aspect and the light weight feel 
1,nice mouse the battery lasts along time before needing recharged and like that do not have to use mousepad with it as it works great even without one 
0,it nice mouse
0,i love how this mouse looked and it didn hurt my hands unfortunately was able to only charge it and now it won recharge at all 
0,looks so cheap didn even work properly 
0,very cool keyboard works great but after couple of weeks after return window closed it will only work when plugged into power kinda defeats the point of having wireless keyboard 
0,worst wireless mouse have ever purchased the lag time to respond to movement is horrble clicking is even worse sometimes have to click three or four times before the mouse works tried on multiple systems just to be sure it was not an issue with one laptop do not purchase complete waste of money and time 
1,needed wifi mouse for my hp chromebook liked the fun lights and the price was good set up was quick and easy via bluetooth works great 
0,i have purchased two of this product in the past year one to replace the other on both of the the scroll button stopped working dropped the first one and understood why it stopped working the second one did not drop it just quit working after months cute and light weight but not long lasting enough for me 
0,gff
1,they work great my year old son likes them for gaming and virtual learning 
0,only problem am haveing is the end that plugs in to the controller the wire is coming loose
0,it simple yet sleek looking mouse ve been using it for almost month and have no concerns about it recommend it 
0,the keyboard literally worked for three seconds and shut off
1,i live in the country and host or go to lot of bonfires and outdoor gatherings we discovered while ago that having radio wasn good enough between lack of music selection and constant commercials the jbl charge is perfect party speaker solution and going to leave my impressions based on that use the speaker is plenty loud if you re on deck patio and it placed several feet away you ll even need to turn it down to have normal conversation it doesn do as well at our large outdoor fire pit because of the bigger distances and lack of surroundings to close sound in that space is about feet from bench on one side of the fire pit to the other and in an open yard the speaker is still good just not great if you like loud commanding music as do if there is larger group of people like speaking at once for example it will not be able to overtake their voices and will be reduced to background music it will also be affected by big bonfire the waves of heat will actually distort the sound on the opposite side of the fire the sound clarity is good bass is nothing crazy but tight and does not distort or sound hollow as noted earlier volume really depends on how small space you re using it in and how many people are talking but even in the big open outdoor area it perfectly loud with only few people most importantly when turned all the way up it maintains clear clean sound and does not get distorted like other sound systems speakers do when you push them see some complaints about it being mono speaker but it sounds fine to me for what it is if want unparalleled sound eq customization and other features ll buy true audiophile equipment bluetooth is easy to connect and lifesaver technology in general if you have cellphone with enough bars and this speaker you can play as much music as you want bluetooth will stay connected at good distance ve walked about feet from the speaker and had no issues not many people would be streaming music very far away from the speaker imagine but it will tolerate reasonable distance charge time is definitely optimistic it advertised as being hours but ve not gotten close to that fully charged and playing continuously at full volume connected via bluetooth ve squeezed probably hours out of it which is still plenty often just let it charge from an outdoor outlet while playing music the speaker is definitely waterproof ve left it outside in the rain couple of times also let it sit on plastic chair with recess on the bottom it rained overnight and came out the next morning to find it submerged about an inch or so in puddle of water where it had sat for hours powered right up with no issues glad tested its abilities but hate to abuse neglect any of my stuff like that if you re doing something similar to me gathering several friends around chimenea on the patio or sitting out back by the fire pit this speaker is awesome and will be louder than you want when cranked up if you re looking to entertain large group of people who are going to be noisy it not the best choice but who really listening at that point anyway 
0,nice mouse
1,i got of these for my kids to game with one on playstation and one on switch the sound and noise cancellation seems pretty good but the headsets won light up which is that they had wanted because the usb cord to make it light up isn long enough to plug into usb port 
0,cant hear that well doesnt light up as stated in ad 
1,it easy to charge and no batteries required really like it
0,needs to be louder rms lol also only last around to hours to full volume and if use bass mode speaker cant handle it at full volume
1,simply put it is great mouse for what it worth however had difficulty connecting the mouse to my macbook pro with the usb adapter that comes with the product have ports the manual grammar is terrible btw tells you to try different ports which they claim it will work normally in one of them none of them worked which was bummer then tried with my own adapter and it connected it right away the adapter they provide you is just useless so if you plan on getting this mouse to use with your macbook you should get separate adapter once connected it though it seemed to work perfectly smooth tracking silent clicks and the rgb lighting is beautiful just got it today so hopefully it will keep working the way they claim it should work 
0,this mouse doesn work well at all ve had it about months and the mouse doesn respond it drags and is not worth the money paid for it 
0,we use this on the boat and the beach brother has one too and they will connect wirelessly with no problem waterproof but will not float without an extra buoy 
0,i ve had my speaker for about months now the cord got really messed up and stopped charging the speaker and it would take days to get it to of the charging bubbles fully had it charging the whole day and it only got to bubble icon fully 
1,love this headset has great quality and never glitches like my other one it great price and has amazing features recommend
0,cool and easy to use at first but broke with in few weeks of use 
1,lights are multicolored and are nice goes to sleep on its own and is great smooth and works fine until it breaks had it months and days and suddenly while scrolling the wheel broke
0,initially thought it great piece but slowly am struggling to use it as it stops working or goes to sleep for long does not get activated by just simply moving bit has to moved few times or even hit it on pad at time 
1,absolutely love it
1,best portable speaker ve owned out of purposely tested the waterproofing in snow sleet storm overnight months later it works like new still use it at work the beach the backyard and anywhere don use my headphones really the sound carries very well in open areas the bass carries alright but it still has it limits as portable the battery life is at least hrs of nearly consistent music and think maybe half phone charge as well everybody that sees it wants one 
1,works well special features are fun
1,excellent product works great as well as being affordable along with having great customer service highly recommend for all people looking for new keyboard 
1,the headphones are great the sound quality is good and my son says they are comfortable very satisfied so far 
1,i saw all the positive reviews and thought this would be winner at first it was great loved the colors it is easy to use but after few months the scroll wheel stopped working dug little deeper into the reviews and realized this is common theme now have to buy another mouse already and it won be another one of these 
1,they feel like cheap plastic and the sound isn that great not fan of the cord either but that personal preference they work if you re looking for cheap headphones and don care edit bought these when they were at least half the price these are not worth dollars
1,great all around speakers pack punch battery life long great bass
0,just stopped working after the nd charge cycle it worked well at first but then just stopped working waste of money 
1,long battery life and great sound quality 
1,love the bluetooth speaker purchased nearly years ago and since purchased more and given them as gifts 
0,it works and it nice but the led are quite dim 
0,keep reading reviews that boast about the bass not true at all only provides mid bass and not low pass so it sounds muffled and offbeat when listening to music with very low bass that was important to me and the reviews were misleading 
0,i bought the wrong mouse to my computer it isn smooth and hard to control mouse on screen computer 
0,honestly waste of money didn charge after hours and just didn work 
1,works on phone laptop tv all that pretty cool and lights up so wahoo
1,it allows me to play with my friends hear clear and rhetoric bbn was reasonable 
1,honestly it far less heavy than would ve liked don feel as though this will be adequate for long term gaming but it ll be alright for web surfing or writing it also fairly small then again have pretty large hands for the price couldn ask for much more but do think it important to inform people of its cons regardless of how cheap it is also it does work with macbook air despite the one star reviews you have to connect the receiver to the adapter it takes good bit of force and then plug it into the computer wish the instructions could ve been more clear about that but it whatever 
1,i play lot of pc games and really enjoy the quiet clicking compared to my old very loud mouse
1,i use this headset mainly for playing cod great sound and very comfortable would definitely recommend 
1,love these products super good brand
1,this thing sounds amazing 
1,arrived the next day and the sound is great 
0,mouse is supposed to have setting which allows it to change colors the lights stay red on both settings no color changing 
1,pretty good for price works
1,the sound from the headphones are good however the microphone is barely picking up any sound ve adjusted sensitivity levels and microphone boost to no avail the only way it picks up sound is if by hand pull the mic closer to my mouth which kind of defeats the purpose super unfortunate 
1,great sound for price 
1,i got my order next day as promised but ordered the blu as you can see it not blue decided to just deal with the red don feel like going yhough the hassle of shipping it back plus work am to pm when am going to have the time it dos sound great and syncs very easy 
1,i bought this for the office to have as something different love that the keyboard and mouse are rechargable totally what sold me on it but would be nice the lights would stay on longer before timing out and if there were more options for the light like maybe blinking or running back and forth or even blink multi color or even different solid colors to pick from along with the different light options blink flash fade etc other than that overall good product thank you
0,bought in january it april and it won charge so it useless 
1,i love this works great and love the lights 
0,only have had this mouse for months and already have to replace it the charging port on the mouse no longer staying in place and therefore not charging the port is wobbling around not making contact to charge going back to battery operated wireless mouse 
1,i love that it lights up but have ps so to have it light up and plugged into my controller kind have to choose which want to use over all it nice looking headset 
0,love the sensitivity settingthe battery lasts long time between charges
1,the mouse is comfortable to move it goes to sleep while in zoom teams call however easily wakes up with one click 
1,i really like this bluetooth speaker jbl nailed it with this series can connect my speaker with friends speakers for the ultimate stereo experience highly recommend ive tried other brands but this is by far the best sounding and can listen all day 
0,not sure if the one got was just defective but the tracker did not seem to work very well as an analyst need something with smooth path and this mouse started stopped very abruptly had to return it 
0,i bought this for my son for christmas unfortunately bought it early and the return window is closed this keyboard will not connect to his computer have also tried my computer and it will not connect either we have tried every usb port on both computer and nothing the keyboard lights up but nothing else 
0,good thing it rechargeable because otherwise your changing batteries everyday instead of just plugging it in 
1,the mouse is very easy to use and automatically connected to the computer would definitely recommend this mouse to others 
1,i bought mouse for my daughter after she took my mouse while on vacation she loves it it has location to place the usb connector while not plugged in it has low profile which looks good with any computer plus it has usb to usb connect along with usb charging cable it also has solid color mode and changes colors mode good price for wireless mouse 
1,plugged right into my ps controller and works exceptionally well if being honest these are just as good as the pair was gifted that broke which is why purchased these and eventually when these wear out will be repurchasing them can beat the price for the great quality 
0,keys stop responding after few weeks contacted the manufacturer tried to fix but no luck received replacement and again within days keys don respond incredibly frustrating do not recommend this product 
1,it looks all fancy and awesome got it for my daughter she loves the looks it not noise cancellation awesome for big heads and not for petite young kids 
1,i love sound
1,my son love it good quality
1,i really loved them the quality is great and they even have noise cancellation recommended 
0,this mouse looks good but that it it works poorly finally gave up and went back to my old wired mouse it just doesn work well you end up wildly moving it around and getting the cursor to where you want it to click on something is struggle would not recommend this mouse 
1,works well but the cord is very clunky these are stylish and easy to use but the cord is very thick and heavy which guess is good thing for durability but not necessarily for comfort do like the option of the volume control being on the cord but it is already so heavy enough that it is cumbersome 
1,just bought near end of july already having issues battery drains extremely fast pointer has tracking issues won click most of the time have to repeatedly click on something for it to work 
0,used this mouse twice went to use it third time and it was completely dead the led were still working but the mouse light underneath flickers then shuts off after being turned on waste of money 
1,using this for gaming and music and stuff lights work and the mic remote works quality is ok quality could be better but its cheap you know how it is some things are good other things are cheap some things are both good and cheap but then they re broken so you know how it is life can be that way for many folks out here in america 
1,sound quality is great comfortable to wear while gaming would definitely recommend 
1,purchased for my friend to use with her zoom classes works great with ipad chromebook and computer so far love it
1,i got this for my sister for her birthday to go with her new laptop and she absolutely loves it very easy to use and adorable
1,i bought this to replace my year old ue boom there was nothing wrong with my boom just wanted an upgrade so thought it was bigger than my ue boom which was no big deal but after charged the jbl and connected it was very disappointed the sound was very muffled hooked up my boom to friend phone and played the same sound on both what huge difference in my opinion the ue boom blows this jbl away 
1,my son loves this headset he says the sound quality is great and loves the light up feature 
1,i can attest to how noise canceling they are or the sound quality my kids took them out of the box hated how short the mic was so returned them otherwise think they would ve worked just fine but we had headphones like these at one point in time supposedly bc the mic is too short it doesn come fully at the mouth others you re gaming with have hard time hearing you this is review from kid gamer who shouts at everyone so sure that if they can hear you bc the mic is too far away then that gospel truth in gaming land 
0,this was horrible purchase am returning this because it sucked 
0,i needed new mouse for my laptop and decided on this design based on its ergonomics however used to the taller mouse so it took some getting used to this design not completely sold on it but ll give it go 
0,the mouse wheel broke and just spins now used this for my work laptop and loved it but if this is the quality it is will not buy another
1,amazing noise canceling ability and one of the best gaming headset have ever used super comfortable and top quality sound 
1,i purchased one of these before and it was really nice like the way it looks and feels it pretty accurate and has good sensitivity and this one got card in it that said get this one for free don know how cuz can read chinese and the instructions are in chinese 
1,update one of the keyboards was dropped once and the spacebar ceased to function that was total loss the other one bought lasted years and worked great during that time then the spacebar also stopped working was not dropped paid for it and it now so opted for different model this time and like it very much it asin bmqhh if you want to search it previous review not sure if this is really gaming keyboard but needed something that lights up when all my lights are out this does the job do wish it ran on batteries but hopefully the charging connector won poop out on me one charge lasted quite while my favorite part of this keyboard is the light noise the keys make the spacebar is bit noisier but the rest of the buttons have pleasant tapping sound without being very clacky like some gaming keyboards waited about months for prices to go down and ordered to of these by accident when found the deal keeping both 
1,excellent headphones for the price great noise cancellation couldn even hear my dog chewing up new pair of shoes right next to me while had them on 
1,excellent for price 
1,i use this mouse for casual surfing and scrolling no gaming but it smooth and responsive and looks awesome 
0,i ordered the teal charge and was sent the camo one little disappointed and it only comes with charging cord not wall plug especially the money pay for this speaker
0,broke as soon as it dropped on the floor 
1,very nice mouse it super quiet exactly what wanted the lights are nice and change on their own haven had to charge it yet but it gets ton of time off the initial charge 
0,bought two of these and one broke after weeks sadly

1,this keyboard is great needed keyboard that was wireless and backlight am not far from my laptop so cannot comment on the orange but am extremely happy with my purchase would buy it again if need one for my other computer 
0,does it job looks pretty and is rechargeable
0,i don like the sleep mode if that what it is that makes me have to press the button every time want to use it again rather it just stay on also it has to be recharged every days and not big computer user so that pain because have to change the cord and usb every time 
0,everything
1,its cool little mouse got it for work reasons like the rgb on it works as intended not really pricey 
1,this mouse saves ton in cost of batteries because it is rechargeable it fits the palm of my hand very comfortably well worth the cost 
1,i ordered this mouse really liked it it was slim fit nicely in my hand and loved how the lights changed colors after few months there was problem with it when the company found out they gladly refunded me my purchase price with no questions asked great customer service would order it again after dealing with them if hadn already bought another mouse because had work to finish give them stars
1,very chic and love the way it lights up it has two settings either leave the lights totally on or have them cut on as you tap on the buttons works wonderful and have only had to charge it one time since ve had the mouse 
1,this small speaker has just as good quality sound as my professional speaker purchased for hundreds of dollars easy to use and bluetooth connect is rapid 
1,great mouse bought second one to take to work
0,it was the best mouse until charge ran out and it refuses to get charged it was pretty dainty and lightweight while it lasted for exactly month now it trash of no use buy something couple dollars more but atleast will last for months 
0,when got it was excited for the usb charging and the cool lights but this mouse has been lot of trouble it will lose connection easily and ll have to click or times sometimes before actually clicking on what want 
1,i wanted to just like it mean it worked but honestly it felt like kids cheap dollar tree toy just can imagine that it will last long should have known better with the price anyway returned it 
1,i was on the fence about purchasing portable speaker as typically underwhelmed with the sound quality but this dig out of the box it was lacking little but after eqing with my phone it is punchy and exactly what am looking for large enough to carry the tech needed to produce quality sound small enough to carry around or even throw in my bicycle bag to listen while riding not much can complain about here if save up the cash might buy second one to get stereo sound but haven honestly missed it that much buy one 
0,it stopped working
0,charge didn last all day and then delay kept getting longer simply don have time to hook it to cord and there no battery charge option 
1,this thing is total game changer my husband and bbq on the weekends and this magic speaker plays our music for the whole day not to mention it sturdy and easy to tote around 
0,pretty colors and does the job 
1,sleek quite cool light effect great price for rechargeable mouse no more batteries to replace 
0,the rest of the mouse is fine but the scroll wheel no longer scrolls took just over month for it to break so can even return it now 
0,it is exactly what wanted
1,super cute but it is really slow 
1,the mouse is super sleek and comfortable for people who like their hands more flat super pretty when all lit up and works perfectly but you better not drop it or drop anything you re carrying it in because it instantly will stop working every minutes you use it there after should have expected this from such cheap mouse but after one minor drop is ridiculous 
1,it all fun and cute at the beginning but after month in half past my refund window and it has stopped working tried charging it nothing extremely disappointed 
1,i love this speaker so many good things to say battery life is great sound quality is awesome and the think like the most is the bluetooth range have not seen any other device with such an impressive range am now building an abs pipe mount for my atv so that can just stop the jbl in and ride away 
0,stopped working after year it won charge smh
0,excelente
1,love the size of this speaker and the battery life seems to last forever use it every day around the house the sound is so clear great value
1,love it 
1,perfect just perfect
1,if you are looking for great quality gaming headset this is what you are looking for the sound range of the headset is great the noise cancellation is fantastic can see my fianc talking to me and just nodding cuz honestly can hear anything of what he is saying am very pleased 
1,i purchased two different keyboards and after trying both this one won hands down it is so comfortable to use and stunning to look at use it for every day use and it perfect highly recommend it every time sit down to use my computer when hit that space bar smile it really cool 
1,ehh it ok good hold me over
1,not bad sound but thought it would be something else better turned out to be same audio as off brand speakers stars for that and stars for bluetooth connectivity and battery life
1,got them for my boyfriend and he loves them 
0,stopped working after months
1,a gift for my grandson and he loves them 
1,this mouse is wonderful and easy to use without mouse pad which is big plus bought this to replace my old wireless mouse because the usb plug is shorter and does stick out the side of my laptop to far it is rechargeable and lasts for while thanks to the sleep function which is easy to exit from love that you can choose to have it light up and changes colors totally worth the buy 
0,sensor is all whacked out stopped working at days so out the money and have to purchase new mouse don do it
1,i ve had this baby for about year probably more sounds as good as day one perfectly water proof in the shower battery life feels infinite bluetooth connectivity is smooth and fast adore this thing only thing to note is that when you charge your phone with it the battery is drained pretty quick but it charges surprisingly fast it not gonna be enough volume for large party but for get together with friends its more than plenty you can hook up additional speakers if you need extra juice anyway so it not even problem the mono speaker doesn feel mono at all everything sounds on point
0,i ordered one to try out it kept disconnecting if didn press key for seconds won hold charge at all so requested replacement it came and same deal just disconnects middle of using it needless to say now have useless wireless keyboards in my house 
0,i finally pulled the plug and purchased this speaker and received april the sound was just ok it didn cover the whole house as would have loved the speaker when out october it didn even last year believe it was due to shortage in the port noticed earlier on that the flap to hide the power ports pushed up against the cord while plugged so my guess is that it finally got destroyed this is very disappointing given the fact that it is still fairly new now have to spend more money on new speaker the next time will go ahead and invest in the warranty 
1,it worked for month and half now it glitchy and won work pass this up and buy quality mouse looks pretty with the colors other than that it was waste of money 
1,works perfectly colors are fun still running on the first charge but do turn it off if ll be away from the computer for long 
0,nice headset
0,not working after just few months would not buy again 
1,i got this mouse to use with my laptop and it great glides easily holds charge for quite while and enters sleep mode when not in use to wake the mouse up you just right or left click the changing lights are great and fun touch
1,i loved this mouse until it stopped working after about month of use it is plugged in and charging but is not responding to movement after about ten minutes ve tried multiple ports and turning it on and off but the thing won respond it illuminating in just blue which it never done before don buy it
1,love it
0,nd one bought
1,great headphones 
1,i needed mouse for my laptop and so bought this the set up was really easy simply charge the mouse plug in the usb and done the silent clicks are indeed quiet but wouldn say they re completely inaudible but that totally okay with me when the mouse charges it turns blue and when it done charging the light will switch off when turn on the mouse to the color mode the colors fade nicely to the next the only nitpick for me is that wish the white part of the top of the mouse was more opaque so that the backlit colors don peek through it but it personal preference also like how it came with usb to usbc adapter just in case it needs to be used for mac overall great mouse 
0,ease of use and portability
0,i got these for my fiance cause he wanted needed new headset obviously he pick these cause he liked the color beside the color looking nice the quality of sound is very poor 
0,upon unpackaging the item everything was as advertised and instructions were simple and easy to follow however after coupe of uses the battery was no longer holding charge the light would turn on indicating that it was charging and couple of minutes later the light was off told myself that maybe the mouse was charging even though the light was not on so left it on to charge for couple of hours unfortunately the mouse was not charging as it was already dead after five minutes of use found myself using my laptop mouse more often then this mouse due to this ergonomic design and lighting is great but kind of useless given that the mouse did not fulfill its main purpose star 
0,after while month or two of using the mic no problems ve noticed when outside of discord call on my pc it would turn up the game playing like roblox and spotify to extreme extents and the sound quality would dip kinda just making me not wanna use them outside of call so now just close my laptop but always stay in call idk why this is problem for me maybe because it changes to mode when you are in social media call but otherwise the headset is greta for it price mic is bit loud tho 
1,great sound and battery life lasts ever
1,sounds awesome easy to connect 
0,liked it lot until it stopped working after only using it intermittently for couple months no longer will right click
1,great on the hand and adaptability to surface device
1,great keyboard the lights are bright and change colors the keys are raised and nit flat which the didn see in the description that they were but its still awesome installed right away wireless no issues would buy again

1,very good mouse recommend 
0,product worked as mentioned little uncomfortable over the ears after couple of hours for those who wear glasses good bang for your buck 
0,the mouse was decent for the price however now just about weeks out of my return window and the scroll stopped working on the mouse days ago was hoping it was random temporary issue but it seems it permanent disappointed that can at least return or exchange the item and now have to go and buy new mouse 
1,i purchased of these and they both worked great for month after month one the keys stopped working and the other stopped charging correctly spend bit more money and get something better 
1,i bought these for my brother he loves this headset 
1,i was so excited to receive this mouse chose it because the color with so nice bought it in mint green and the features of the multicolor led lights however to my surprise this mouse doesn hold charge after maybe two hours of use it done and needs to be charged for few hours in order to be used again naturally went back to my original apple mouse 
0,they are ok for the money
0,i liked that the colors really popped so almost never lost it but ultimately it just pair of headphones with really static ey mic 
0,bought one for my girlfriends birthday and bought one for myself we are able to pair to each others portable sound system the battery life was my concern for her and so fare its been phenomenal and the music is like you are at live concert 
0,i like the design of this keyboard the only question have is why do have to keep it plugged in to keep it charged 
1,i absolutely love this mouse great color matches my laptop perfectly love the color changing mode so fun 
0,i got this head set and the mic doesn work it barely comes to your mouth the sound isn too loud and the headset feels so cheap like cheap plastic can stress this enough do not get this headset worst product have ever bought on amazon

1,i was insanely surprised by the overall quality of these use them on my ps and they sound way better than headset very surprising 
0,we re very happy with headset except it stopped working after only months which was very disappointing 
1,great keyboard slim durable long lasting battery great connection bought other brands and returned them all this is the best wireless keyboard 
1,this mouse is so slick and smooth it is very quiet with the clicking love it 
0,it charged up the first time and didn charge up again after that and the replacement batteries for it cost more than the mouse itself very cool looking tho 
1,i bought this for gaming my dad said it will be total trash but he let me buy it it came pretty quick plugged it up to my ps controller and played some destiny the sound was stellar then plugged it to my brother pc and played some minecraft also good the only problem have with it is if you don have portable charger you can really use the lights unless you play pc lot on the back there is only one color light green the mic quality is really good compared to an ipad mic ve had it for few months really sturdy great for music great for gaming great for anything the noise canceling is not good but for say it epic 
0,the clearness sharpness of sound also that it came in camouflage vet 
0,the charge for this mouse only lasts day very annoying and it isnt the most quiet either feels cheap performs meh dont waste your money 
1,there was nothing disliked about this mouse it is very nice
0,i like everything
0,bought this and it stopped working within year terrible product don buy and save your money for better product 
0,my son liked these so far 
0,the scroller broke within week and the material looked greasy and worn after about week of very limited use 
0,does not do that great and the mic doesn really pickup your voice well you have to talk really loud checked all my settings 
0,just over month old and the roller no longer functions realize these are cheap but month use exclusively for work not heavy use 
0,would buy again
1,i love this product its quality it came in really fast and love the sound take it on my paddle board all the time 
0,good quality
1,was my daughter birthday present she is extremely pleased thank you very much 
0,i bought this because it is gaming headphone and the reviews looked to be good quality however plugged it into my pc and at first only the audio output was working and recognized on my computer when unplugged it to see if that would fix the microphone not being recognized the sound stopped working ran troubleshoot program and the pc doesn even acknowledge the headphones being plugged in with the jack looked online its very common problem 
1,this is very nice headset for ps the only complaint have is that it only lights up when the usb is plugged in which can be difficult when you already have stuff for gaming plugged in the sound works great being plugged into controller overall it has worked great and my son likes it would not suggest buying based on lighting up unless you have an extra usb slot to plug it into usb on ps 
0,worked flawlessly for few days then the left button became unreliable not worth the hassle to return update seller emailed me saying that they had corrected the problem and offered refund if took down this review replied rather have corrected unit which would then review they replied they weren fixed yet and offered to my refund ignored it 
1,my son loves the keyboard as an extension of his school laptop he thinks the colors are cool and the ease of use is great we had slight problem with charging and contacted the company real person responded to my inquiry very quickly their solution was efficient and thoughtful and my son was back to using his keyboard in week this was good purchase made better by the good customer service that backs it 
1, the mouse is low profiled easy to use it connects instantly and is ready to use as soon as you plug the adapter into your computer it is very comfortable to use and the video shows it extra cool light show 
1,love it 
1,the mouse worked great for just over month then the charging port detached from the mouse yes came right out no longer have the ability to charge it this was probably glitch with my individual unit otherwise would have given it stars 
0,no dislikes
1,it was perfectly fine
0,it is little bit but the sound makes up for it
1,this mouse is slimmer than others since have small hand it is very comfortable to use great buy 
1,in short you get what you pay fori am currently traveling and needed cheap mouse could use this one definitely does the trick and looks nice with the colors on the side but also has couple downsides the dpi change button doesn work on mac the colors at the border aren really bright and even the red light of the sensor always shines through it also is bit small if you have big hands which is upset if you re traveling since it will fit in small spaces in general it is good mouse if you do not want to spend lot of money but there are things that could be better if you want to spend bit more 
0,they re just cheap quality and they re not really comfortable mic isn that good and they literally snap crackle and pop when you go to put them on your head 
0,its nice mouse good size but the scrolling wheel doesn roll anymore ve only had it for month and it broke 
1,such cool mouse surprisingly good especially for the pricepoint 
0,i love how long the wire is as well as the ability to not use the led light there is also knob on the device to lower or raise the volume wished the mic would go bit closer to the mouth area but seems to be all right for now 
1,use this for gaming and its awesome 
0,i even purchased new controllers they went dead after weeks 
0,yeah no the roller fell inside had barely used it
1,has good sound for portable speaker bluetooth hooks up good works great for golf carts 
0,battery life is terrible and mouse stops working from time to time no idea how this product has such high reviews 
0,the battery of this mouse works well haven timed it but have left it on overnight and it stills has battery not gamer but imagine the gaming quality will be affected depending on how strong the bluetooth connection of the mouse is to the pc setup recently switched from laptop that had the standard rectangular port usb to one that needed the adapter usb the adapter that comes with the mouse worked for about minute before it stop functioning so brought out my own adapter from different device and the mouse now works also tested both adapters with wired mouse it suffices to say that it was the mouse adapter that is not working could have gotten faulty one so the problem could be exclusive to me tl dr mouse adapter didn work ur screwed if urs doesn work either and don have an extra one 
1,i like that its wireless and the keyboard works like charm 
1,the sound on this speaker is absolutely great for its size long battery life and being able to plug my phone into it is very nice option 
1,very slim easily fits in my laptop case led lights work great and add fun touch to the mouse no connection issues 
1,easy to set up and use like the slim design 
0,i ordered this mouse because was tired of using my laptops track pad at school it arrived on time charges quickly has very satisfying and quiet mouse click sound and overall is great mouse for the price the only issue face is that the rgb on the front of the mouse is almost completely broken and there are small sections around the edges that are broken as well it doesn prevent the mouse from doing its job though and often find myself using the mouse with the rgb off anyway overall good mouse just don expect the rgb to work amazingly it is only after all 
1,it was great mouse until it stopped working and charging literally only used it about times since buying it and when put it on the charger this last time it just completely stopped working the charger light wouldn come on and it wouldn charge even switched usbs to see if it maybe had short in the wire and still nothing now that reading other reviews see the problem wish would have read them thoroughly before buying it buy this only if you want something short lasting with pretty colors other than that don recommend this at all 
0,my son goes through headphones quickly not certain what he does to them these are holding up well to the abuses of kid they have good noise cancelling because he can hear me when try to talk to him the short fixed boom is wired well and seems to be holding up 
1,i use it plugged in as the battery life is ok but not amazing but does what it supposed to do great addition to my workspace and very comfortable on the hand
0,this is an update to my last review it has been months and it stopped working bought this because of the price and color next time will go with more reputable company 
0,loud enough for any home activity and kids parties in public pavilions can be connected to laptop via bluetooth to get more volume and bass 
1,i been looking to upgrade from my old headset these are everything been looking for they re comfortable and the sound quality is fantastic 
1,overall great keyboard and rechargeable too the computer doesnt give you any warning whatsoever when the battery is low or dead so it might cut out mid use similarly the battery life isn stellar but that to be expected of light up keyboard overall good value at its price point 
0,i bought this keyboard because it seemed like deal with the backlit and silent key features found the backlit features to be almost irrelevant when using in the dark because the alternating and dark colors made it difficult to see put silent keys in quotation marks because they re not really silent the keys felt no different than basic keyboard that you can buy for if you re looking for good quality and can spend more suggest logitech that why immediately unhooked it and returned it so can go back to buying the logitech 
1,easy to use and love that it rechargeable 
1,it an excellent keyboard the keys have great texture with very sense of comfort the layout is eu enter key so you ll uncomfortable until you get used it for while especially if you are using usa layout keyboard during the day 
1,love it 
1,love it and the colors 
1,after about two months mine stopped holding charge although it works plugged in also noticed that space bar has gotten to be really loud compared to the keys it looks super cute with the rainbow lights though 
1,i bought the gold it soft brushed color and it very quiet during use the brightness of the color change is soft also it fits comfortably in my palm good purchase 
1,beautiful and ergonomic the only thing would say is the battery doesn last longer but in general it great product
1,i just used this mouse for work few hours day and it inexplicably stopped turning on when flipped the switch after just days plugged it in to charge like done few times before and the blue light came on when the blue light went off unplugged it and switched it on but it flashed red couple of times and wouldn work repeated the process with the same outcome know it cheap mouse but wow got less than one day of use for every dollar spent 
1,very cool my brother loved it
0,lasted months
0,replaced my boring mouse with this one wanted something rgb and rechargeable love it so far 
1,this worked great for months then it just stopped working it fully charged but won work tryed changing adapter and still doesn work not an expensive mouse but not worth anything if it doesn work 
1,awesome

1,awesome gaming headset 
0,i only used this mouse few times and the wheel scroll broke after months would other wise be stars
1,this was good mouse got as gift and really liked it until it didn work anymore after while it stoped working and looked at some other reviews that said they got defective one well guess did and they are kinda common to be defective so would only risk buying it if you want the mouse decent amount would say you re chance of it being broken is like also it only stops working after like days so you won know until then if you buy it also did like that they added usb adapter in the box use they adapter for something else now 
1,i ve only had this speaker for week but it left great first impression played it all day long doing work around the house it has good sound and good bass for little speaker battery life is amazing 
1,love the light up mode super quiet highly recommend
0,don walk run from this keyboard and company they say there is year warranty but there is not keyboard will stop working less than months from purchase
0,stopped working after two months
0,it is sleek don care that it hass to be charged every night my other mouse rarely has to be charged went back to that one so do not care for this mouse
1,i have been looking for wireless keyboard with back light and came across this one am really enjoying it no am not gamer am using this for work like the lights on the keyboard it really light weight and it does not take up lot of space the only issue is one of the shift key is loose but it not that bad to point where it needs to be returned for me that just my opinion the keyboard only lights up when it in use then after few minutes it goes into sleep mode and that not issue for me 
1,this item exceeded my expectations it is good size but not too large to handle easily the sound loudness and clarity is excellent we own the smaller version that we have been pleased with but this one is great for outdoor use would purchase this again 
1,i love the jbl speaker brand and this speaker lives up to the name and brand of jbl 
0,bass is weak volume is low no way to adjust this was more than the oontz angle bt speaker that got three years ago and it not better at all holding down the bt button with the button simply causes the speaker to unpair and power down these are not helpful don waste your money on this if you re looking for anything other that very poor bass and it overheats like snowflake in the sun so if you want to take it to the beach don just don buy this 
1,i really enjoy the feel of the mouse it slick which has put less strain on my wrist but ll still be getting wrist support the colors don need to be turned on and when left in middle it keeps the mouse on with only the red light from underneath 
1,love my headphones for ps very good in anything play
1,nice clear loud sounds great quality 
0,good
0,nice packaging counts for little when the instruction manual tells you nothing about how to use it had to go to youtube also for touch typists you may find it too soft quiet returned
1,great for gaming and everyday use 
1,awesome product 
0,great keyboard for room with low lighting
0,sadly it is not working 
0, nice for the price would buy again 
0,i purchased this keyboard in nov and have really loved it it is quiet and well back lit and just fun to use because of how colorful it is sad to say it less than year in it will no longer hold charge so it is only usable when plugged in still good buy but just sad that it didn last year
0,works very well
1,nice quality beautiful cards 
0,cord don take beating at all
1,this is an awesome speaker great sound
1,the usb adapter is ill fitting and won keep charging the mouse unless it is held and tilted just so luckily have another adapter and that is working fine so the mouse itself is good 
1,just bought this mouse and was really excited to use it but even after charging for multiple hours the mouse will turn on briefly and then immediately stop functioning just goes to show that items this cheap often are too good to be true save your money and buy better mouse 
0,only holds charge for minutes 
0,do not use this keyboard if you are programmer and need the backslash key often typically this key is to the right of the close bracket key instead its row lower this requires you majorly change how you code you can even remap the key to something else simply because theres no other key to remap it to 
0,this mouse feels good in the hand looks cute as all get out but did not last month after charging only once have had issues with it being sluggish and not holding charge 
0,i had my mouse for about week and after using it maybe times it completely stopped moving around only things that works on it is the buttons and the wheel
1,i am not very hard on this mouse use it to work from home but this morning after only using for months the wheel of the mouse broke not sure what happened as am very gentle on the mouse it nice design and love the lights and the fact that it rechargeable but it is pretty cheap and can break easily so keep that in mind when purchasing 
0,i work from home and work hours day depending if do overtime or not so needed mouse because my wireless mouse of years was dying now got this mouse in hopes it would work great because of all the reviews the first day got this mouse it was very uncomfortable so right off the bat knew didn like flat mouses because it was cramping my hand second the cursor was glitching unfortunately cannot attach video because it would be on company property and don have personal computer ll have it on one side of the screen and automatically it will go to the other if you like mouses like this and can deal with the glitching then that fine but for me hated it very frustrating 
1,mouse works well and is good value for the inexpensive price 
1,had them for while use them with ps awesome for the price
1,worked great at first after about month the sensor stopped working too late to exchange or return now use this for work might be worth it to invest in something of better quality looks nice that about it 
0,i had no issues with the mouse but dropped it from not even ft from the ground on accident of course and the spin wheel and the left clicker broke ve ordered another one and hope it lasts longer than this one did 
0,so far so good was suppose to be christmas present for my son however it came boxed with lb bag of dog food and keyboard box was smashed also the seal was cut open so had to have my son make sure everything worked not much of present surprise but at least it works so far 
1,fits well and comfortable for my year old great price too the plastic seems little cheap but looks like it will hold up well enough to my rough year old boy 
1,works great
1,my first jbl speaker and plan on buying more after purchasing this one the battery on this thing is amazing excellent sound as expected from the jbl brand and great sound for the size phone always connects easy and charges it fast as well just want to buy more because hear jbl speakers connect fast and easy with one another 
0,the lights on the side of the mouse are not as bright as thought they would be but still like the mouse none the less quiet clicking charges quickly 
1,i like the mouse it operates excellent and the light show is great everything wanted when bought it thank you very cool and functional 
0,the micro usb to usb adapter does not work you are better off ordering mouse that connects directly to the computer via direct bluetooth that does not need receiver 
0,the design is pretty but the functionality is crappy my mouse censor keeps glitching in and out which makes it impossible to work with definitely will be returning which is really annoying because it took forever to arrive and it was supposed to be replacement for my previous wireless mouse that fell to its death from the nd floor last week 
0,easy to use and light
0,roller ball broke after weeks of use 
1,easy to set up like that it is rechargeable and don need batteries 
1,great product and powerful sound easy to use and very portable recommend getting hard case for it 
1,much more than expected sound is awesome and built very well
1,not really ergonomic but don have an underlying issue where this is problem for me love the color changing aspect conversation piece and the charge lasts couple of days also turn it off when leave so really don know how long it really lasts but have not had any issues its mouse if you want it get it if you don don 
0,i use it for my daily concerts in the showers haha even on low volume it still loud 
1,after few months the connecter is picky if it wants to work or not was great when it worked perfectly but with unplugging and plugging in it has gotten weak and no longer likes to work would recommend if you don have kids that like to play with your gaming set up lmao
1,certainly helps to look at instructional pictures and to try to translate what the instructions mean
1,my son loves his gaming mouse
0,it sounds amazing at low price
1,thankfully didn buy this from amazon bought it from walmart it sounded great and jbl has always been favorite brand they had it for the same price as amazon so took it home and opened it up as amazon states it does not come with charger which is problem because it does not charge with standard usb charger plug it also comes with no instructions or documentation returned it for refund too bad because it really does sound great for its size guess you really have to go to big box store so you can hear it and check out how to charge it gave it stars for battery life because really can judge battery life since never got to charge it and use it gave it one star overall rating because if you can charge it with standard plug it useless 
1,for the price you can complain super low profile led lights works really well no lag 
1,looks good works well
0,not good enough sound quality was just ok 
1,i bought this mouse for work it was great at first it supposedly rechargeable was able to charge it once fine it died again days later and now won charge or turn on ve tried different cords blocks and outlets so confident the problem is the mouse this is useless 
1,working great plugged in or wireless have no problem so far
0,i picked this up because was looking for quiet wireless keyboard the reviews and product information said this was the one for me but it disappointing the keys are quiet but the space bar is so loud and rickety that it more than makes up for the quiet keys and since using this to type all day and not game the space bar gets hit lot ll deal with it and the other features of the keyboard are fine but this is disappointment to me 
1,what like everything what dislike nothing this review is actually the first thing that typing with this new keyboard the keys feel little spaced out but ve been stuck with tiny bluetooth keyboards using my phone as my computer which this works flawlessly with the samsung galaxy note and with the dex setup which currently utilizing feel like purchased much more expensive keyboard than what paid for this the packaging and items inside are esquisite the glow of the keyboard is bright and fantasticly appealing wish this had bluetooth format but maybe the next note will feature connectivity to ghz devices 
1,this mouse has become my new best friend have arthritis which has severely affected my hands its extremely ergonomic in shape and usage the mouse is absolutely quiet as promised plus is easily used without huge amount of pressure from my fingers hand or wrist the mouse also moves very easily on my mouse pad with no glitches or hesitations my hands are grateful and so am another feature is the light additions which means it can be found anywhere in the dark also the aqua was an excellent choice in color for me as it does show against many darker colorsonce charged the battery is good for quite few days do use the mouse from four to eight hours daily and sometimes more have only had to charge the mouse once in the past week after using continuously for eight days actually it was still working but had become bit slow to react rather than wait for it to quit completely charged it during the night so it was ready in the morning for the next week am very glad chose to try this mouse my next purchase of mouse if or when needed will be repeat of this one in different color this is an unpaid and unsolicited review from grateful owner

1,i love the color looks kinda gold tbh

0,this is not good product we all know the number of good reviews online for this item are inflated by bots was feeling cheap and ordered this headset as replacement and it was even worse than expected the fit is terrible the materials are hilariously cheap and the mic was broken out of the box the joke is on me for ordering these be smarter than am

0,i purchased for our office the mouse looked nice and the colors were pretty but mine started having problems just few days later it was unresponsive and jerky for few days then it stopped working despite charging overnight tried charging on different outlets to make sure the outlet wasn bad but it wouldn hold charge and died again within minutes when asked the other employee about his identical mouse different color he said his never seemed to work right and wouldn hold charge used the included cord and tried charging with the computer with hub with power strip and with charging block not included plugged into multiple outlets when returning packaged the items as requested and requested the pick up slip we found the return slip face down on the ground on the sidewalk several feet in front of our office few days later not stuck to the door or in the mailbox mounted next to our front door no one knocked to let us know it was delivered and we wouldn have found it if staff member hadn gone out to sanitize the outside door handles now we have to take it to drop off location because return pickup is going to cost despite the package being ready to send before the return sticker was dropped off am unhappy with both the item and the return and have already ordered similar replacements from another seller

0,sux stopped working after month of use will not charge 
0,thumbs up
1,works on phone laptop tv all that pretty cool and lights up so wahoo
0,the mouse only worked if it was plugged in not at all wireless like it says
0,works well light weight
1,i love this it is very portable waterproof and awesome 
1,great for gaming excellent at noise canceling
0,the box came opened and smashed the microphone barely worked at all and now simply does not work the sound is fine the microphone was just an important part 
0,battery doesn last long maybe hrs at time 
1,the mouse was surprisingly lightweight am accustomed to the wireless mice that are battery powered and it makes huge difference it is super sensitive too was able to use it on fabric and on wood directly without issue my old mouse required mouse pad the lights can be left on or turned off but you still see the red glow of the sensor when lights are turned off the usb receiver was easily found underneath it was bit difficult to pull out but using my nails it came out pretty quick it also comes with the usb adapter which you don see often but believe it would work with chromebook or maybe with usb charger it has everything need and it is crazy how lightweight this thing is 
1,it seems to be working just fine to me when it came also like the glowing effect from the led lights
1,sound quality is amazing you don even have to turn up the volume all the way up to hear the bass 
0,i hate this product
1,super easy to use and transport works with my pc
1,it really good in my opinion use it to play rust lot and it great 
1,very good considering it pretty cheap had mine for almost years and just now having to buy another definitely recommend sound is clear and microphone is pretty good as well 
0,i loved this but ve only had it two months and it stopped working 
1,i like the way it produces quality sound and enjoyable 
1,i love this speaker had it for years and its like its still new
0,worked great at first but now the right click button does nothing am back to my track pad avoid this device cheap components
1,headset was good while it lasted just over days wrapped cord for better durability clearly not resilient and that was with fairly mild kiddo 
1,feels very comfortable to use lightweight compatable with mac 
1,works well as described slim and easy to use even came with dongle for usb if your computer has it lights can be turned on and off 
1,with teenagers its hard to buy expensive equipment knowing how it will be treated but the price of these headphones was good for the value my son is very happy with them and they didn put huge hole in budget 
1,i really like this keyboard haven had to recharge it yet and after almost weeks have to say it pretty nice
1,please for the love of god don waste your money on this headset mic quality is terrible and audio cuts in and out straight out of the box spend the extra and get mic that is worth it 
1,overall the speaker is great it is quite bit hefty but that is to be expected with all the rubber keeping it waterproof as well as the rest of the hardware inside the battery life is pretty spot on with about hour of constant usage and the sound is clear and loud very much worth the purchase and if you catch it on sale even more so 
1,i actually use this keyboard for my workstation and it super awesome love it and don know what else to say about this product it super fun and it lights up when you re typing and it awesome
0,product broke after one month of using 
1,love it
1,i bought this keyboard to replace my old one because my daughter spilt her drink on it this keyboard has worked out perfectly it keeps long charge and is easy to move around have my home office set up at the kitchen table my daughter also uses it for school love that it is not too bright but lights up just enough to see the keys when needed would recommend this to anyone with kids and those who needs to move around their work area frequently 
0,definitley bigger then the last one we had
0,i recently bought this mouse because have used it before but my previous mouse broke after having it for around months no big deal the new mouse bought does not hold charge for very long at all can charge it for an hour or two and it dies after about minutes next time will buy another product 
0,worked great while it lasted the roller wheel stopped working first week back to school after summer break the roller wheel just spins in place one of the arms snapped it has been kept in protective pouch 
1,this product is really great comfy cushion for ears comfy design on head not professional gamer so this is great in design and price would highly recommend
0,everything was good on except for the fact that the battery went bad really fast like within hours of use it would not hold any sort of charge after that 
0,we purchased two of these and the scrollers broke on both of them in less than two months there was no trauma to them they re just junk 
1,it great headset overall my son loves it 
0,microphone broke months after purchase
0,this is decent headset if you re using it for pc gaming there is no noise cancelation the loudest volume is not that loud to be honest the led lights needs the usb to be plugged in which is on the wire next to the plug you would put into your controller you can use it for playstation or xbox but you can use led unless you have some sort of attachment on your controller with usb port guess should have expected this since it wasn too expensive although for this product think the price is lot this is equivalent to dollar headset based on sound quality no noise cancelation and the led lights not being able to be plugged in especially if you re playing on playstation 
1,i love the quiet click no more obnoxious loud clicking 
0,i expected the earmuffs to actually fit over my ears but these are too small and just sit on top of my ear pressing then down which with long gaming sessions causes fair amount of pain an discomfort edit today may the seller bengoo contacted me directly and offered me as an incentive to remove my negative review which is violation of amazons sellers policies 
1,i love how you don need battery just recharge it great and colorfull 
1,great mouse sleek and fun great price 
0,got mouse for my son the light look cool and it was comfortable no complaints until the trackball quit working after about days contacted the company they communicated well and replaced it very quickly about week later the same thing happened again great communication and no issues with refund so good communication but not the best mouse 
1,it days past the return deadline and this item is not working any longer wow
1,honestly it far less heavy than would ve liked don feel as though this will be adequate for long term gaming but it ll be alright for web surfing or writing it also fairly small then again have pretty large hands for the price couldn ask for much more but do think it important to inform people of its cons regardless of how cheap it is also it does work with macbook air despite the one star reviews you have to connect the receiver to the adapter it takes good bit of force and then plug it into the computer wish the instructions could ve been more clear about that but it whatever 
1,ill start with cons unresponsive sometimes doesnt tell if the battery is low there is no indicator so if youre playing intensely and stops all of sudden it will pissed off little keyboard sound is like so and so its not mechanical it will make sound depends how heavy you type you can customize the rgb its fixed pros keyboard lights wont bother you if you play while the lights are off keyboard lights has modes which is cool steady pulse and no lights you can also adjust the light from low to high rechargable and has its own usb type cable and has its own bluetooth connector to pc when charged it lasts quite long if you play casually it can go up to to days without charging it goes on sleep mode if not in use lightweight always put this on my lap since my pc is connected to my tv and always play from my bed budget friendly its good keyboard if youre not ready for razer and corsair type of peripherals and looking for budget friendly one then give this keyboard try update am returning the keyboard as it is faulty the and quotation mark got switched its becoming more and more unresponsive got this days ago and its not doing so well update on battery it lasts days max if used casually am changing my review to star and dont recommend this now better look for something else or really invest to good brand gaming keyboard instead its waste of time and money for just little feature 
1,absolutely love everything about this speaker the battery life is insanely long if you re debating between this speaker and another one get this one you won be disappointed 
1,i ve had the flip for years just started going out so hope the longevity is the same for this one obviously the sound quality between flip and charge is way different but instantly impressed love that now able to charge in the truck now definitely makes some great sound in about sq ft we use these as kitchen speaker while we cook it amazing have had this for about hrs if any severe inconveniences come along will update this jbl has been long favorite of mine btw an audiophile and have installed at least car audio systems 
1,works great for home office and gaming
0,didn work
1,not to many wireless mid range bluetooth speakers can hang with jbl maybe braven but that about it bose is great but jbl got them on the bass in mid size speakers 
0,it is decent for its price although its really tight on the head very good vendor got faulty one and got it replaced 
0,good quality
1,works amazing we have house full of various jbl speakers but wanted big one for our shed easy to use holds charge awesome super easy to pair and the blue color is perfect love that it has flat area on the bottom for stand with the controls on top ports have nice sturdy flap covering them to keep out dust and dirt
1,works perfect connects easy long rechargeable battery
1,bought this for an office laptop it works great 
0,the cord going into for charging doesn fit exactly right seems cheaply made wouldn buy this brand again 
0,failed to work in months
1,great speaker had second version ue boom this blows it out of the water
1,you get very good quality mic for solid all around and the sound noise cancellation was better than expected only problem is the mic isn that maneuverable and sometimes my friends can hear me that good when have it close to my mouth
1,i love the colors that it shuffles through also like that it is virtually sound proof no more hearing click from across the room only thing wish could pick stationary color instead of that feature always being red 
0,the first one had defective charging cord connector very loose and the replacement sent promptly starts fine and gets steadily slower and more and more draggy and must be turned off and on again to start working normally both were returned under warranty and won be reordered again neat but not good quality 
0,piece of junk already broken irritated
1,i love this thing the sound quality is good for the size and it very portable obviously you can just max the volume on it and your phone it gets distorted like anything else for the price pay this is absolutely worth it use this mainly in the bathroom while showering since it beats phone music out of the water even carry it to the garage and place it and jam out while working on my car considering getting another one of these for family member 
1,i love how the sound response on this headset 
1,i got this because love playing different games ranging from first person shooters to indie singleplayer story games it works for everything if it does happen to run out of battery then you can easily plug it in and keep doing whatever you like 
1,usb connection is weird for ps doesn work for anything but charging comfortable ear piece and good price but sound quality on highest setting is mediocre at best decent treble and bass levels too but output is garbage 
1,this keyboard was awesome for the price keys feel really natural and it is quality product the batteries don last super long but keep it plugged in would recommend if you are looking for an affordable gaming keyboard 
0,great product but little too flat for me 
0,everyone should be mentioning the radiation this speaker is emitting keep it at least two feet away don carry it around it emits high radiation even when it off 
1,it extremely comfortable and you can hear everything 
0,i charged it once few months ago still waiting for the battery to die and it get used pretty regularly nice thing is that it only uses battery when it in use 
0,broke within two hours of using it you really gotta watch the amazon return policy on electronics have tendency to buy it and leave it sitting in the box for way too long bad me because this is the second or third time ve gotten burned on crap like this 
0,my mouse worked for months and on the third month it wasn scrolling anymore and the mouse itself was just falling apart don spend you money on this item 
0,this mouse works for mins or less at time then has to be powered off and on it starts lagging charged it all night so its not battery issue and it only works when its all lit up not in the mode
1,this is perfect for gaming 
1,it honestly awful it won charge and ve tried four different chargers 
1,i bought this for my new laptop because really don like the finger pads on laptops it is truly plug and play and works awesome plus it looks really sleek 
0,i was kinda disappointed with this keyboard on one hand it great and affordable wireless keypad it feels bit cheap but it serves its purpose thought it was backlit but it not really hence the star review not sure if it me or the description of the product but was really disappointed in this regard overall though it good little wireless keyboard not great if what you re looking for is keyboard to use in dim lighting though even on the best setting it seems to go dim over very short period of time 
1,awesome
1,great product as advertised works really well very nice 
1,this product was definitely worth the money it equipped with every function desirable for wireless mouse being rechargeable is alot better compared to constantly switching batteries personally the rgb lights were nice as well 
0,the mouse only worked if it was plugged in not at all wireless like it says
1,great for people who game alot
0,hearing was phenomenal but static here and there
0,garbage colors on keyboard go in and out and if you don touch keyboard for seconds it goes completely black waste of money cant see the keys when am gaming at night terrible one star for usability 
1,great sound quality volume bass and superb bluetooth range battery lasts forever
0,it was going well for few weeks then my son dropped his macbook and the usb type connected broke its so easy to break and would not recommend
0,wired good sound
1,it comfortable it has mute and for you to control the volume
1,this is my third try at wireless backlit keyboard the first two were from different manufacturers the first two consistently duplicated and omitted many keystrokes finally found one that does what expected it to do the adjustable brightness backlight works fine and all keystrokes are accurate the key profiles are not as tall as other products in this category which is good for me wouldn think that should matter but found the taller keys on some of the others to be annoying like the somewhat minimal footprint for full feature keyboard as space on my desk is limited don use this for gaming but sometimes have to get up in the middle of the night for work call and the adjustable brightness backlit keyboard is welcome feature so don have to turn on the room lights for two minutes of computer work at am overall am very pleased 
0,bad quality 
1,wish it was bit louder works amazing though
1,this mouse has become my new best friend have arthritis which has severely affected my hands its extremely ergonomic in shape and usage the mouse is absolutely quiet as promised plus is easily used without huge amount of pressure from my fingers hand or wrist the mouse also moves very easily on my mouse pad with no glitches or hesitations my hands are grateful and so am another feature is the light additions which means it can be found anywhere in the dark also the aqua was an excellent choice in color for me as it does show against many darker colorsonce charged the battery is good for quite few days do use the mouse from four to eight hours daily and sometimes more have only had to charge the mouse once in the past week after using continuously for eight days actually it was still working but had become bit slow to react rather than wait for it to quit completely charged it during the night so it was ready in the morning for the next week am very glad chose to try this mouse my next purchase of mouse if or when needed will be repeat of this one in different color this is an unpaid and unsolicited review from grateful owner

1,i use this headset on my ps and it works amazing 
0,this is well worth the money 
1,update after six months the keyboard has died won hold charge any more my whole experience with this thing has been negative and would strongly recommend against buying one even if it is cheaper than when bought it original review when gave it three stars bought this primarily because wanted wireless backlit keyboard and this one lights up well only it goes off after only about minute and leaves me in the dark you of course only have to punch key to bring the lights back but it still interrupts my whole process when working it has nice touch which was why bought gaming keyboard even though don play games and would otherwise like the keyboard but this feature leaves me contemplating buying different brand drives me crazy 
0,the speaker is powerful
1,my niece loves this fur her college dorm 
1,this product fits like dream compared to the razer kraken line of headsets the mic isn as adjustable but prefer fixed mic as it won wear as badly and the mic quality seems comparable if not superior the cord is high quality as is the included adapter for being stock part they look just as cool as the photos aesthetically as well 
1,i happy with my purchase it wasn an expensive mouse it wireless and rechargeable all things was looking for it is slim mouse which took some time for me to get used to only use it for office work tasks so can speak to other uses however don notice any lags delays or other issues do wish there was some way to control the colors but it not big deal also the top clear button clicks but haven figured out what that does 
1,works like charm you can change the mouse speed right from the actual device love it

0,its cool mouse till had to recharge it plugged in the cable that came with it and it started getting hot until saw smoke ripped it out almost burned my self regular phone charger works fine tho 
0, update after left the below negative review the company contacted me and offered me to remove it would assume that several reviewers have taken them up on this offer and have removed negative reviews so not only is the product junk but the company has shady business practices skip it go somewhere else this is the second pair bought for my son guess didn learn my lesson the first time first one worked for two months this one worked for less than two weeks it ish for reason don waste your time 
0,last me long time never have any problems

0,i have this speaker for months and used it total of times it stays in case in my room always somehow it has stopped working it is not charging and switches off after couple seconds one light blinks consistently during charging but it isn charged will not recommend anyone spend this amount of money on speaker that will just stop working

0,disliked
0,i just use it as regular mouse 
1,great headphones for gaming highly recommend 
0,it came on time looks nice and is very light weight

0,would recommend 
1,the sound is fantastic control buttons are convenient and work easily with little effort love that there were so many colors to choose from 
0,it stopped working after falling on the floor 
1,cord gets super hot when trying to charge using my lap top and not charging
1,speaker sounds realy good clear with good bass 
0,you cannot turn the speaker off without it making loud noise they know it annoying it meant to get you to install the app if you install the app giving up more of yourself to them in other words they let you turn it off think it meant to be annoying because even if you turn the volume down to and cannot hear anything else it will still make loud noise when turning off they want you to not be able to turn it off quietly for example when you were listening to some thing in bed and forgot to turn it off and later on want to turn it off quietly works fine otherwise the one star is just cause think it fair to penalize such behavior 
1,everything works great on the headset
1,product is awesome very soft and silent great for gaming 
1,lights are multicolored and are nice goes to sleep on its own and is great smooth and works fine until it breaks had it months and days and suddenly while scrolling the wheel broke

1,great for gaming and work from home very silent and waterproof accidentally tested but the rgb could improve more modes or disable the sleep mode could be great
1,its slick well made mouse and will be buying another one thanks to manufacturer for nice creativity in build 
1,i expected it to be lot louder had it outside for party and it wasn as loud as thought more for indoor for sure but still love the sound quality would still use it outside but just not for party
1,the mouse doesn work the reason they have good ratings is because they ask you to rate star and promise refund don buy 
1,i really enjoy this product and am very happy with the quality of it the only thing dislike is that can listen to music without getting buzz out other than that very good headset highly recommend it

1,a sweet ergonomic mouse with good responses 
0,i do like the mouse but the usb connector does not go all the way in to my macbook which is frustrating

1,ok so gave star for gaming because do not know if this is good keyboard for gaming just use it as regular keyboard for my mac book pro my friend has one he uses for gaming and loves it the reason why bought this for regular usage was because went to my friends room to print out some documents and used this keyboard it felt great looked cool and was super comfortable to use plus liked the backlit lights of course so this is my reasoning for buying it and it did not disappoint have used it for few weeks now love it and will stick to this brand and style of keyboard from now on 
1,the mouse looks nice however the instructions are in chinese struggled with connecting but once figured it out its working awesome so far will do an update in few months so far so good 
0,bought it for my year old lil bro for his xbox one he seems to like it
1,these headphones are great for gaming with my friends like that the microphone folds up and it works perfectly with my ps would say that the passive noise cancellation is just due to the thick memory foam earmuffs which are nice but wanted to make it clear that they aren active noise cancellation headphones 
0,this mouse is just trash it lifespan is days stopped working just days after the return window closed don recommend purchasing if you want something that is actually functional and long lasting getting tired of amazon allowing vendors sell junk without recourse 
1,this thing worked great the first time used it then wouldn work at all won charge won move the cursor total crap 
1,my son loves this and think every kid that games should have one works great
0,could be louder when connected through the xbox controller
0,was very hard to click not worth

1,great keyboard feels and looks good and comes with nice little note quiet and little small about inches by inches but connects quickly and holds good charge too customer service is outstanding very happy with their warranty policy and they gave me brand new keyboard when mine stopped working if you need gaming keyboard this is the one 
0,a very well made mouse responsive with no lag only issue is the lack of adaptability no buttons so all procedures are what manufacturer has set in like the wireless operation and the lack of batteries 
1,the mouse feels alright in hand but mine has an issue of pulling the cursor to the top left looks of the mouse are good though and the lights are subtle yet cool 
1,nice looking mouse beautiful colors and comfortable hold for any sized hands the battery on this thing is surprising charging does take time but seriously that won be problem because this thing can last long do suggest turning this off to make sure the battery doesn drain sleep mode is brilliant but do turn it off so you won get caught off guard for when it does lose battery 
1,i recently bought this for my son it perfect we ve had issues with soo many head sets being cheap quality this one is must love the color options as well his favorite color is orange so he loving this please order if you are considering buying one

0,had to use different type to usb adapter because this one did not work 
1,love it never disappointed with sound 
0,i have only used this shirt time it alright it does take minute to get used to the low profile my biggest complaint is that it didn come with charger as stated now have to find charger that will fit or spend more money to purchase charger just to ensure can recharge it 
1,this is an awesome mouse it is slender build so it fits small hand the lights are totally fun when you click the buttons it is strong click so that you know you have clicked on something it also has quick response on the computer it has an off on switch plus an automatic shut off so you won use up the batteries will be buying one for my daughter it is awesome

1,worked perfectly
0,i like the charge this is my second one you can pair them together for stereo sound using the jbl app 
0,i was so excited this mouse looks beautiful but it was one of the most frustrating devices have ever used when clicking to wake it up it would click on whatever may be on the screen at the moment including email or im drafts that have not yet been reviewed or perhaps written in anger and did not mean to send lol when you wanted to click on something you had to click several times overall frustrating very good return process no questions asked and quick refund that why stars

1,love everything about it
0,this item was returned the one time it worked it was awsome 
1,good price cool lights conveniently comes with usb to usb adapter 
0,these headsets bought pairs didn even work right the first time either were used clicking the sound button does nothing to shut the sound off nor does switching the mic part up there are just time while playing cod where everyone does not need to hear my background noise one of the pairs got stuck all the way extended and can get it to go back in all in all say invest bit more money and get nicer pair 
1,i love that this model still has the aux port with all the great things of the newer models 
0,disappointed that can connect with phone calls otherwise great
1,i like to keep office lights turned down depending on task at hand and appreciate the illuminated keys this is just for my personal office use would actually prefer the option to use battery power but charging by usb now and then is fine personally was looking for keyboard with larger letters as my eyesight has gotten worse but sny option saw was wired not offered as wireless would also have preferred all one color but for my personal use this is rather pretty 
1,the user was not expecting rechargeable keyboard and has been pleasantly surprised by this one the bells and whistles haven been main draw past the first day or two fiddling with the colors performance wise this keyboard has been standing up well to normal business use and the recharge at night is not onerous it just one last thing to do before heading out for the day no big deal 
1,i think this is the best mouse have used really love it 
0,my son wanted these do hear loud buzzing when the volume it up high 
0,i wanted product that thought have for at least the semester since ve purchased it the ball that scrolls down up is no longer working makes mouse almost pointless to have seems am going to need new mouse 
1,exactly what wanted great sound battery lasts forever 
1,i love this speaker and love can take it anywhere and charge my phone when at work when have no outlets the sound is clear and so loud love it 
1,the wireless mouse worked well in the begining it was small but it fit in my hand well and the lights were nice though not necessary feature received it in september it wasnt something used every day about once or twice week in february the scroll wheel just broke it spins loosely and no longer scrolls on the screen do not use it often and am definitely not rough on it am dissapointed in the quality of this product 
1,i got this because our child sleeps while work the mouse is super quiet pro quiet lef right buttons adjustable sensitivity micro usb is easy to charge and doesn interfere with mouse use color changes usb doesn disconnectcons middle button click is louder color can be set it rotates it be cool if could lock it in for this price it pretty good purchase 
0,literally will not charge or hold charge
1,ive had this about year the key board worked great if the receiver is infront of my pc my keyboard is only ever ft away it has slowly come to thiscurrently foot and half away and have to pick it up to type while it plugged in to bring it closer ths sna sewt rendem is what was received while trying to say this is only somewhat recent development 
1,i pretty happy with this keyboard except for one thing the enter key spans two lines and the pipe button is moved down line this small feature really slows down my typing especially in unix environment just can seem to get past that hopefully in time will but switching between keyboards will likely be an issue other than that they key board lights up nice holds charge is fairly easy to type on wish the keys were like bigger and haven tried swimming with it so can speak to the water proof part can exchange it because already recycled the box ll make it work for now 
0,mouse is very pretty aesthetics of it is nice it handles well but it broke within couple days of getting it the button stuck wouldn click anymore unfortunately liked it so well this was the second one that ordered and the first one that ordered the rollerball stopped working but it too late to return that one so now have two broken ones the lights on at really cool the battery lasts really long time in between charging but now have two of them that have broken and six week think
1,the attached picture is for review of the stickers the letter that had to buy for this keyboard if you look at the paint that outlines the key it wearing off other keys are wearing off too and once they wear off you can see the letters you just see globs of colored light what use is an illuminated keyboard if you can see the keys what more if you don touch the keyboard for seconds the illumination disappears and the keyboard is completely dark even when it plugged in the only way to wake it is to touch the keyboard again so now you have keystrokes on your screen in your document on your game etc that you didn want know keyboards wear out but ve only had this one for few months very shortly after submitted this review and after took the time to add all of the stickers to the keyboard it began to malfunction and add characters that wasn even typing gave up and retired it after about months update never contacted the seller about the keyboard when they saw the feedback they reached out to me and replaced the keyboard for free without having to return the defective product four stars because will have to see how the keyboard works out for me this time but must give klim technologies usa six stars for outstanding customer service 
1,i like the mouse originally thought it wast great for the price and glad to be wrong the mouse is little sensitive because dropped it once causing it to freeze somewhat however after re installing it it seemed to fix the issue also am enjoying the colour changing which helps me relax almost overall highly recommend as it is compatible with pc and mac just plug and play 
0,the keyboard won connect ve tried to many times ve contacted amazon support with no assistance save yourself the pain and get something else 
1,love this little bullet for the money it the best thing out there 
1,very happy with this bluetooth speaker sounds great and easy to carry around seems to have bit more bass sound than some other brands 
1,i like that it has flat bottom that let the speaker be more stable now we got one for my husband and my son they love them 
1, so far so good does what it supposed to do worked right out of the box like that don have to buy batteries for it it charges quickly lasts looking time and is compatible with my hp chromebook it has two settings solid red color only when mouse is moving and slow changing rainbow when mouse is moving and or at rest the usb tucks away into the bottom of the mouse which is where you ll find it when you open the box for the first time also comes with an adapter and short charging cable 
1,works well nice bass
1,for gaming its good and the audio is amazing would recommend to friends 
1,the mouse is slim lightweight and has beautiful colors the paint has started to rub off and have only used it for maybe weeks can tell it will not last too long 
0,easy to use and lite weight will purchase another one soon
0,very nice sound 
1,i really like this mouse it is low profile and fits my small hands perfectly the only thing really don like about it is all the flashes of different color lights on it need to check to see if there is way to disable the light feature otherwise very nice mouse 
0,really liked it at first especially since it charges and doesn need battery but the courser jumps everywhere have accidentally closed out my browser and all my tabs several times once during meet with my boss where was presenting of course now that have definitely decided this mouse sucks and want to return it the window is closed don buy this mouse 
1,love this keyboard but couldn figure out how to recharge had friend who is much smarter than me don throw out usb cord connect this between computer and board simple yes holds charge for long time
1,this speaker is the best ever had the smaller version of this speaker prior and the battery life was basically nonexistent even with full charge so needed to upgrade decided to go with this speaker and so happy did the batter life lasts forever literarily never charge it or very rarely do and have yet to have it die on me the sound quality is outstanding it gets super loud without compromising quality and you can even charge your phone with it amazing speaker 
0,it is exactly as pictured works well 
0,bruh this headset worked for few months then the light started to not work and then my input was all messed up can get corsair headset for just dollars more and it would be better
0,the mouse just feels odd in my hand it serviceable but when it dies not buying another 
0,it takes as much time to charge the mouse as to use it not practical otherwise the mouse worksand it is ergonomical
1,would totally recommend can be used for personal listening or with bigger group for chill hangouts parties
0,this mouse would not connect to my compute despite multiple attempts following the instructions given as is typical of many amazon products this product is cheaply made and not worth wasting your money on would suggest avoiding making purchases from this brand in the future and strongly suggest not buying this mouse unless throwing money away on broken pieces of junk that don work is past time of yours then knock yourself out 
0,max volume is still very low you can barely hear

1,won last not even year this is garbage
1,i don like the fact that the speakers came without charger not happy because will need to spend more money to buy charger for the speakers 
1, when opened my mouse noticed there were scratches on the top of the mouse towards the area where your palm would rest when in use also noticed that the adapter that arrived with the mouse did not fit the usb that would make the mouse compatible with my macbook so had to use different adapter considering paid for new mouse was expecting to get better quality gave the mouse second chance and this time received one that didn work 
1,great sound and last for long time without needing to keep charging it 
1,i can believe didn purchase this bluetooth speaker sooner it sounds sooo good perfect amount of bass too for the bass lovers battery life is excellent as well

1,low profile feels good in the hand responsive
1,i bought one to use outdoor around my pool and loved it so much got second second one to use in stereo mode battery life is incredible and lasted over week with or hour swims the fact that they are weather resistant is big plus as mine have both been splashed quite bit put under the diving board on end to keep it out of direct sunlight and heat and the other one is at the opposite end of the pool under pool chair these have bass crisp highs and they will really crank up the volume but don annoy my neighbors takes less than minutes to turn on and connect to eithet my phone or tablet the tablet option is nice on stand if want to watch football game while taking swim star highly recommended 
0,i like the feel of this keyboard the back lighting works well it solid keyboard the only reason didn give it stars is the back slash key is next to the enter key all my other keyboard have it above the enter key frequently hit the backslash when intending to press enter ll get use to it and would probably them give this stars after do 
1,gaming headset was perfect for boys that are not always careful
0,the keys start to fade and you can see the letters numbers after repeated use

1,so light and love it being rechargeable
0,the price point is good but these are functional hut not comfortable 
1,it good speaker don get me wrong but the jbl flip is better in sound quality and louder you can save money if you get the flip

1,good sound good headphones
0,wire is broken within month contacted seller and got refund immediately now they are changing vendor to get good quality wire 
1,quality on it is great although it doesn fully cancel out noise great for your first set of gaming headphones
0,not sure why but this keyboard worked fine for about months and then poof no more just wouldn connect to my windows pc at all before that would have given it stars as it had the return button in weird placement compared to standard keyboards and it did seem to need charging more frequently than would have liked 
1,great sound
0,these ended up being bit of disappointment we got them for our son for christmas and we didn realize that in order for the lights to work the cord also needs to be plugged into usb port he was using them mostly with tablet so this was bummer now only three months later the cord has completely severed and they don work at all these have had extremely light wear and tear never leaving the house and only used for couple hours day 
1,love it best choice made its clean and has bass as well 
0,after month the connection became very finicky constantly cutting in and out of the time typing is nightmare constant unread inputs look else where if were you 
1,love this lil speaker sounds great
1,i bought this for my son birthday and he absolutely loves them would definitely buy again 
1,update received replacement pair after the mic on the first was static my son uses these for gaming so the mic is really important the mic was exceptionally clear sound is great too very pleased especially for the price 
1,the sound quality is decent but the mic doesn work that well so if you need mic to play with friends wouldn recommend this 
0,already stopped working exactly after the return window closed 
1,this mouse is of good quality am very satisfied
0,received broken couldn hear out of both sides returned
0,sometimes the keys work when click sometimes they don it get really annoying

0,this was pretty frustrating to use it kept shutting off and the tracking was pretty awful ended up throwing it away after about two weeks worth of use 
0,doesn stay charged
0,this mouse quit working after weeks poor quality returned 
0,my son received this for christmas we ve had it for months and the sound goes in out he constantly saying that it doesn work 
1,i bought this speaker for our pool in our park its just enough to carry great sound for everyone to enjoy
1,honestly feels bit on the cheap side and compared to other similar makes the main difference being led lighting so it adds wow factor to it clicking is also smooth and feels nice and the top down view is pleasing the lighting itself is mostly smooth but blotchy at some points where the color is abrupt rather than seamless transition performance wise it does the job but ergonomically doesn feel as form fitting as gaming mouse really use this as backup work mouse or home mouse where its just to surf the web also the cursor sometimes randomly jumps first time this has happened on mouse so it seems like they really cut costs and marked up the price if were to guess the price if seen the product without price tag probably say its about bucks 
1,excellent sound
1,someone gave me charge bought charge thinking could pair them nope so bought another charge pairing is difficult if you desire stereo sound as opposed to two mono speakers had to get second jbl app and attempt to import my music into it some of which won play when do get it to play in stereo it doesn stay that way for long the hardware software combo has been finicky and temperamental for me also amazon is not letting me add an informative photo 
1,works great looks cool microphone works on laptop and gaming
0,sleek good battery backup auto sleep led lights silent clicks
1,convenient quite excellent connection with computer
0,i like how the colors lookit is not recognized brand but it does the job 
0,despite the description saying it was macbook compatible it wasn have the macbook air with the chip regardless it nice mouse and it quite as described and does work on pc was able to test it on my pc 
1,i love it iv had it for two years and it great lowkey spilled coffee on it yesterday and the light and everything still works ve spilled multiple things on it and it still good so it is granted waterproof also bought this cover for it to travel with and it fits 
1,update tried charging more often and making sure turned it off seems it doesn last as long as hoped switched back to battery operated bluetooth mouse worked well for the time being bought and the other is still working for now as of now ve tried to use it on notebook tablet and desktop to ensure it connection issue maybe it the battery but not sure if sleep mode is active the battery shouldn be having issues in such brief time of having it it should last few days after full charge overnight 
1,my son enjoyed it used it for gaming
1,they work just fine nice price
1,works great comfortable and smooth 
1,works great and connects instantly wish the lights were bit brighter and had an option to let them stay on they turn off after minute or so ve had this for months now and some of the buttons stopped working maybe have faulty one but prior to this it was doing it job great for price but it is cheap 
0,i like the shape and the way the mouse works unfortunately can even make it through whole day of work without it needing to be charged again 
1,outstanding customer service had question and received an immediate response and resolution love this mouse and would recommend it to others 
0,i only had this item for month if that and it has already stopped working it will not hold charge and it is not the cable shouldn have ignored the other comments about it not working don make my same mistake 
1,just like the head states the windows key no longer functions also don particularly appreciate that the lights on the keyboard do not stay illuminated for more than few seconds work on three monitors and need functioning windows key to move you guessed it my windows around using the shortcut windows shift arrow key figured it was my pc so changed to different pc in the house had the same issue then went back to my wired keyboard no problems another keyboard for the junk pile

1,outstanding speaker with amazing base for the size linking to second or more speakers is fun party favor 
0,no usb only type c
0,it doesn work
1,good quality mouse very easy to pair and it feels nice in your hand like the led touch
0,didn work
1,i ve only had this for week but love the clarity and bass sound used to play from smaller but loud speaker and the sound of this baby is just astounding like true sound system but with the benefit of taking it everywhere with me 
0,i loved this mouse used it for few hours of office work once every week or two so very light use in the scheme of things for computer mouse received it end of june and it is currently middle of december so about months until the roller scroller part of the mouse broke 
1,this is very user friendly modle very light weight silent rechargable and easy to move around just one suggestion it will be better if the instruction has english version 
1,for the price it works fine and is comfortable can wear it for hours and it doesn hurt have no idea about noise cancelling not an audiophile or anything but it sounds fine to me for my needs have asked people on the other end if the mic sounds good and they say they can hear me fine it is loud enough but do wish it was able to get even louder for some uses rating it stars for filling my needs but stars on the gaming scale because while can hear footsteps and surround sound sure it must not be as good as turtle beach or something ve also had it for years and no issues no idea about the lights because ve never plugged that in 
0,wasn terrible but prefer gaming mice with at least the two buttons on the side
1,love it
1,my daughter use it for her laptop an plays few games on it the battery life is fair since she does use the mouse alot say about to hours countulessy
0,lightweight easy bluetooth connection the glow adds an extra pizzazz

0,changed the batteries out twice the keyboard must be plugged in to work once you unplug it from the wall it dies 
1,i love the headphones they allow you to change the volume and mute the mic without touching the screen would like if the mic was adjustable 
1,great packaging quick and efficient shipping and came in great condition good bang for your buck highly recommend 
1,love this mouse
1,this speaker was great addition to my back deck it provides just enough volume and bass to make music enjoyable without being too overpowering the charge port is great for friends who need to charge their phone while it plays our audio love it 
0,its not wireless use the mouse for my hp elitebook and the only way can use it if have the charger connected
0,when bought this mouse loved it it took me few tries to get it paired right but it is game changer for my laptop the rechargeable battery life on it is great found that if the mouse stopped responding quickly that it was time to charge it purchased it late september and at the end of april my roller has stopped working randomly it worked and then went to use it an hour later and it no longer does the scrolling wheel is an essential feature for me with my laptop disappointed 
1,i like the portability of thecharge sound quality and the easy connect ability to blue tooth 
1,i bought this mouse for my macbook and it would not even turn on charged it all day and it would not work or connect to my laptop it just flashed red color like the battery was dead and that was that happened save yourself some money and look for another mouse elsewhere should ve just gone to best buy or target

1,make sure you keep an eye on kiddos with these headphones overall they are great in sound and support
0,does not work at all and will not connect to laptop dont waste your money
0,wouldn work with xbox one returned for refund 
1,on the pricey side but well worth it for my needs it great for filling the backyard with tunes podcasts while gardening or playing with my two dogs pros loud clear sound simple operation excellent build quality available in variety of colors cons could use an eq in the app or even simple low mid hi curve control to optimize it for different listening environments can be powered on off remotely from app summary we were sufficiently impressed with the charge that we bought second unit for garage basement use 
1, aesthetically this is very enjoyable to use because of the changing colors of the rainbow like how it wireless and it can even work from small distance away on another table from separate from my computer it works very well it has an on and off button for storage 
0,feels very cheap wouldn charge on my laptop had to plug it in on my desktop to charge it finally got it charged just for it to die after hours of non continuous use it getting returned 
1,well am not gamer but am coder and was looking for good keyboard tried variety of them but this one is the best its ideal for typing and the light does not pinch you eyes in the dark it has the option to adjust the brightness level and you change the colors according to your need all in all love it and would recommend it 
0,good headset
0,i bought this headset few days ago and this is by far the worst headset have ever owned the sound in game is horrible and my friends can hear my in game sounds though the headset also it hurts my ears the padding is not very good can stand this headset threw mine in the trash and will be buying different one 
1,the fact that it has quiet mechanism no sound whatsoever during clicking was great but even though only used it for my desktop computer at work days week it is not working right now did not carry it around or used it for more than hour during each day basically because use my laptop most of time months is pretty premature time frame to not function 
1,this is top quality and the sound is very good battery last long and charging other devices is easy
0,when it worked it was good now it no longer connects to the dongle or stays on ve made sure it is charged both through wall outlet and usb port 
1,it works and it cheap so there that not great mouse by any means but then again it was also like so not mad
1,cool mouse slim and comfortable 
0,do not buy this it doesnt connect or show up on my laptop to pair it dont suggest anyone buy this item
1,works very well best part is charging the mouse through power chord rather than batteries 
1,a well engineered mouse with long battery life good design and cutting edge wireless connectivity very easy to set up and use recommended 
1,i wanted to love these headphones because saw so many good reviews fresh out of the box those blue lights were super cool appreciated that they came with the adapter for headset jack or mic headphone jacks the headset itself was comfy and fit well could hear everything else great except myself default couldn hear myself at all knew to change my windows settings to increase the microphone volume but unfortunately the mic quality is just not there tried to use them to game with my friends and they said sounded worse than the last much cheaper headset that had update returned this headset over months ago and the company has directly emailed me five times claiming their product has since improved and keeps offering me compensation to update take down my amazon review read into this as you will am not interested please stop emailing me 
0,good colors fast shipping
1,really good sound quality comfortable for hours because the ear pieces fit over the entire ear instead of squishing it down 
1,i love the wireless mouse it hold charged in month even though using hours per day it is quiet and work great thanks for good product 
0,excelente
1,the volume is not to low was expecting better sound
1,rechargeable beautiful features long lasting hours for use on off switch 
1,the thumbnail makes this look like it is class headset and to it credit the sound quality is better than any set of earbuds or headphones that have ever used however the build quality is very poor it feels cheap the plastic feels like something that would be purchased in dollar store purchased something that looked similar on here about year ago and it surprised me in the complete opposite way leading me to believe that you do not need big brand name or tons of positive reviews to get good decent product but guess lightning doesn always strike twice kept these since it didn seem worth the hassle in returning them and it is still good to have backup set especially one that don care about but if had choice to purchase different pair would and am advising you to do the same 
1,don buy these they won last more than two months 
0,the bluetooth crackles and disconnects constantly think it came defective from the factory also sound quality isn very crisp overall wouldn buy this again looking into swapping the product out or getting refund if possible 
1,love this speaker great quality sound and battery life worth every penny my only small complaint is wish there was some type of hook to secure it when on the river 
0,for the price you absolutely can beat these the brand name was very odd twist on more notable brand but very solid product 
1,it really lives up to the silent clicking making it comfortable in way the batter also seems to last quite few days if you turn it off when it not in use it also has various light patterns when you click the button in the middle the silent clicking is what really gets me 
1,i bought refurbished one but it looked brand new and untouched so saved few bucks and that was good the green color is cool much cooler than black which was my second more expensive choice it connected immediately almost to my ipad iphone macbook the sound is great it very loud but don play it that loud yet bought it to use outdoors for music so expect it will work well paired with an iphone it simple compact device but it delivers great sound could not be happier and it waterproof which hope never to test but it nice to know because it will be outside and might get left outdoors overnight on occasion battery life seems fine so far but have only used it for few hours time will tell on that one 
0,i got this in june and it now the end of september it was great at first and lasted multiple days on charge but now the battery dies after just couple of hours and it dies randomly without any warning so it always in the middle of using it frustrating this lasted maybe months in total
0,they are not loud at all even turned up all the way on the headset and you can barely hear it
0, 
0,i was told that the speaker makes two sounds before playing audio from the other paired device one for when it turns on via pressing the power button and another for once it connects to paired device got no sounds from either of actions turn the fully charged speaker on from this point am supposed to hear sound notifying that the device is on all see is the power button light light up then press the bluetooth button and that lights up too then connect it to my phone which has connected to other bluetooth devices perfectly fine get the notification on my phone that it is connected to the speaker but no sounds from the speaker notifying that it is connected to the phone even reset the speaker and it still gives no sound very disappointed will be returning 
1,i am old school when it comes to navigating the screen work much faster with wireless mouse everything about this mouse is great except you gotta to charge it mouse that require batteries work for very long time months in fact the charge on this mouse doesn last long have to remember to turn it off when not using it also have to remember to plug it into charge after long use starts acting sluggish as power runs down my old mouse is years old wanted cool new one to match my new laptop this one has soft smooth click the led lights are really fun however threw away the box before tried it out would send it back if had kept shipping material ll just keep the old one close when the new one is charging so much for progress i
0,good
0,well it mouse but doesn recharge has stupid little white old tech mini usb looks like it charging but it not this mouse was so thin it hurt to use for long periods but only lasted till the battery died has charger but it won recharge used multiple cables
0,bought this to replace my destroyed jbl flip sound quality is awful compared to the flip also the flip had lanyard attachment to hang it which you can with the charge and the charge function takes hours to charge my samsung overall save your money and get the flip its less expensive louder better quality

1,it was great and on time delivered 
1,i love it the battery last decente amount of time
1,awesome keyboard perfect for late night design work in the dark 
0,the scrolling wheel is already broken and havent even used the mouse for month 
1,i used these headphones for gaming and they were by far the best headphones especially considering it price the earmuffs fit nicely on my ears and are very comfortable what would make these headphones even better would be the ability to change how high low you want the sound of the game versus the sound of voice chat and vice versa like ps headphones 
1,great sound and design of mic 
0,cool header comfy too 
1,plain and simple this is good quality loud and portable bluetooth speaker think if you want to get the job done the jbl line is it in the year ve had it ve inspired few friends to get their own after hearing and enjoying it don fuss with eq or other features because this is my portable party speaker and out the box it tuned just fine for that if you want the best sound quality with stereo and more settings you should will probably need to spend more than what this is to get notable improvement 
1,gaming for fun
0,i had high hopes due to all the positive reviews but this mouse became virtually useless after just weeks would move the mouse on the mouse pad back and forth and it would barely move on the screen every task on the computer began to take the amount of time it used to had to resort to using the trackpad on my macbook which not fan of definitely don get this mouse not worth it 
1, so out of boredom ordered one of these gaming keyboards this one from klim and got into the head of the gamer must say there is tangible cool factor to battle ready keyboard everything is in the spirit of the gamer there is an air of science and fantasy as you email your coworkers something really mundane aside from that here what else the klim offers the keyboard is nice and quiet accuracy is the same as with my old keyboard turning off the lights in my home office and typing from colorful keyboard is cool 
0,this mouse is ridiculously cheap do not buy garbage 
1,this mouse did not work from the get go which is why am certain was not it first owner this mouse was missing the one part it needed to operate usb receiver which is customarily located securely under the unit itself the mouse was halfway in sleeve as if re stuffed back into it original packaging returning this immediately
1,i like it good it shine keyboard functions reliably and has long battery life like that it auto sleeps to save on battery it especially beautiful too there is some latency but it not noticeable when playing games like the sims or planet zoo 
0,one drop to the floor it broke 
0,its cheap made useless keyboard range is horrible sleep mode activates way to soon lights turn off only after second or so leaving you guessing what key to press if using in the dark battery is horrible lighting is horrible don bother with this one unless its for year old 
0,i got this for my laptop and it does not work very well it skips or just does not move at all gave it to my grandson thinking that since it says it for gaming that maybe it would work better for him but he does not like it at all he says the feel of it is off and it does not stay connected 
0,falls asleep entirely to quickly midtyping and the keyboard is asleep horrible for gaming as the lag is sometimes to seconds between key being pressed and actually recognizing it was pressed customer support page contact seller brings up an atv page and they dont help 
0,this is quick responsive and easy to use mouse it can be run normally or with it built in lights sleeps after short period of unuse but wakes with single click micro usb charging cable included charges the mouse in no time light is on when charging and turns off when done with the sleep mode the battery lasts longer than expected 
1,the headset is comfortable and good for the money only complaint is how large the volume and mute button is compared it to roku remote and as you can tell it is fairly large for only things on it good product tho 
0,don buy scroll not working
1,this is great the jbl charge sounds fantastic with clear crisp sound and bass that will keep even the hardiest rockers or listeners quite happy and it lasts forever on full charge we ll not literally but longer than any other chargeable device have ever owned it won die in the middle of your beach party four thumbs up from this music lover 
1, haven had this mouse for more than week and the left click is already broken it won snap back into place loved the mouse in the beginning which made me order replacement hopefully this one doesn let me down 
0,have used this mouse for more than month now the cursor jumps around unreliably on the screen making it difficult to navigate battery life is not very long before needs recharging feels very cheaply made in hand do not recommend 
1,alright purchased this product about years ago and it has gotten regular use over all for what it is it is good product for good price do wish there was an option to dim or turn off the led lights when using the keyboard but that fairly small issue my one frustration is this there is no place on the keyboard to store the wireless dongle the slot it comes packaged in is just rectangular hole in the back of the board with tape over it once it is unpackaged and getting used regularly not having place to lock the dongle in to the keyboard when transporting it creates risk of losing the tiny little bt dongle which is exactly what happened to me when moved my home office so was without use of this keyboard for about weeks the good news is that when contacted klim they were happy to mail out new dongle free of charge in fact the first one they sent got lost in the mail so they happily sent second replacement free as well and tracked the package this time so the product is middle of the road and could use some engineering improvements but it worth the money and more importantly the customer service is star 
0,terrible quality after weeks no good will not recommend buying at all its waste
1,great sound
1,just got it today and started using it few hours ago so far so good like it 
0,i an very unhappy with this products uses less than year the wire on usb adapter is broke and the mouse no longer work not happy at all can send back so you can look at it

0, works well until it goes into sleep mode when you wake it up the cursor is incredibly laggy and skips around the only way to get that to stop is to turn it off and then back on which seems minuscule but it gets really annoy the longer you use it maybe just got defective one it got some really high marks but buyer beware video shows it being woken up then turn it off on and it works fine

1,i have had this mouse for almost months and use it at least hours day haven been paying close enough attention to amount of hours until it needs charging but in the time have had it have only had to charge it times and was able to continue to use it while charging do use it for gaming but my games don require fast and accurate like rpg etc so can say yes it does gaming for me but unsure about speed games pros it slim and long so it feels good in my hand even though it not ergonomically built and it fits nicely in my carry case the colors are soothing you have options for either standard usb or usb for chargingthe cons the on off button is teeny weeny and sits flush with the hole you need nails or stylus to turn it on the sensor underneath sometimes has issues with the mouse pad and it skates over the pad good shake usually gets it right all in all it priced reasonably for what you get update like everyone else just few days past the day return cutoff my mouse also died no power wouldn charge dead contacted the manufacturer mototo inc and they said they have year warranty on this mouse and they would be happy to send out new one 
1,love this mouse for my laptop glad chose this one not only is it comfortable slim and sleek in my palm but love the rotating fun colors that it emits which can also be turned off for the single color mode

1,the colors are really neat and the keyboard is an awesome fit with my setup

1,it puts out great sound easy to connect with battery life is great it is really hard to say anything bad about this speaker well worth the price 
1,works great would highly recommend
1,these are exactly what was looking for and got then half off as well would definitely recommend have seen that people were having issues with the mic on nintendo switch but it works for me it works for my pc nintendo switch and even my phone the price is cheap but the quality is high they are also very comfortable hate using headphones but these gaming headphones are great for just about everything stars hands down 
1, update to prior review this mouse started out great was so excited about it at first then after couple months in all of the sudden the usb that goes into the computer just snaps breaks and ll add did nothing to it one day while working from home moved the laptop to start work and noticed the mouse wasn functioning looked to see why then saw the usb had just cratered into couple pieces so now paid for nothing good lord my own money too not something my office will reimburse me for either nice work 
0,the scroller broke and only used it about times in total the rest of the time it sits in my bag the lights are dim don like how small it is it does not have the best tracking the clicking is louder than expected it also just feels cheap would not buy it if could do it again go for more quality one somewhere else 
1,amazing sound
0,i work from home and purchased this keyboard for my work computer prefer the backlit keys for work and usually the letters don wear off as quickly this worked great for about weeks and then it was no longer quiet keyboard my kids complain about how loud it is even rooms away and it misses keys when type or double types letter when pushed it once so if you like purchasing something that works for weeks and then sucks this is the keyboard for you otherwise keep shopping lol
0,disappointed with this product stops tracking after few seconds of usage regardless of how have it charged faulty product 
1,i have had this headset for month and half it very good headset love it so much big fan with how many different color choices for the headset there are too thank you guys so much 
1,for the price you can complain super low profile led lights works really well no lag 
1,i ve had this headset for over year now it good headset to use if you re on budget and just need basic use the sound is pretty good the only complaint have is the mic sound quality was told by my friends that sound muffled but that is to be expected for headset for this price still highly recommend buying this though because it definitely is great headset for its cheap affordable price it easy to use and for me has been quite durable normally cheap headsets will start to degrade and tear from excessive use but found that this material has held up good for my uses have big ears and found it to be pretty comfortable for my ears over long period of use definitely recommend buying it now as the price has dropped when first bought it the price was around 
0,lasted barely two weeks wire disconnected from the prong lights don work needed cheap set well got it 
0,didn work piece of crap
0,home pc
1,i recently bought new chromebook and wanted wireless mouse to match came across this mouse and after reading the reviews figured id give it try cant say how good it works yet because never recieved the usb adaptor with it and for some reason cant get it to connect wireless im sure ill figure it out but it wouldve been nice to have the wire option as well otherwise its slim which is what wanted and like the lights on it
1,very comfortable great sound quality
0,i do have to charge it about once every couple weeks or less that better than needing batteries suppose
0,i only had it for week and it quit charging even tried other charging ports it would not take charge waste of my money
1,these are great we use them on an old xbox one for fortnite and also on laptop one of the better headsets we have gotten 
0,it states that it has usbc converter but it does not work
0,i just bought this plugged it in and nothing my computer won detect either the headphones or microphone stay away from this product 
1,the headphone cord seems little long but other then that they get the job done would definitely recommend 
1,this little mouse works great for my needs it charges straight away from my laptop and functions as expected would buy it again and recommend it to anyone needing an inexpensive wireless mouse 
0,great sound however stopped working with no sound after only over year contacted jbl only one year warranty they only offered discount code to buy another speaker no thanks 
0,i would not recommend this mouse as it feels like the plastic will break on you at any second it very cheaply made and the light shines through the top layer of plastic which makes it look way worse 
0,it came quick
1,my husband loves his gift quality sound from his jbl charge he is trying to sync to his jbl charge please send email how to do 
0,this is the bang for your buck but before you get too wild about it there are some things you should note after some use the keyboard gets little squeaky dont know if got defective product but for me whenever was trying to press while holding spacebar the would not register leaving me stuck with another inventory slot this makes it really bad for action games because if you were to switch to the second slot you would have to let go of spacebar if those things dont bother you buy this keyboard its amazing 
1,i have tried charging this mouse with the original cables it came with did not charge then tried multiple cables and power sources already owned still did not charge left it plugged in for hours while was away from home come home to an uncharged mouse the blue light stays on for about seconds before shutting off the design and price were what attracted me to choosing this specific mouse would recommend spending bit more on quality mouse that can serve its purpose 
1,easy to setup and use nice addition to my studio setup in progress 
0,love the slimline appearance and the changing colors the colors add sense of fun to normally mundane piece of computer equipment also love the ability to keep it one color red or allow it to change colors and the ability to change the speed of the cursor good product well designed make sure you are aware of the button on the bottom as it is not just an on off switch but has three positions this is now october this mouse broke after little use while traveling the scroll wheel broke inside the mouse making it useless this appears to be poor design and weak point in this item and would now not recommend it have had other computer mice for years without this issue 
0,this mouse feels good in the hand looks cute as all get out but did not last month after charging only once have had issues with it being sluggish and not holding charge 
1,i got this in the mint green color and like that color the only issue is that it broke in about month so if you really need mouse for your laptop but if you want cheap one then don really recommend this product 
1,we just purchased these headphones yesterday received prompt next day delivery the packaging is nice headphones look great easy use sound is good has good base noise cancelling is also good will be using them for gaming today 
1, love it love rose gold so this was perfect you can have the lights like did or just solid color or off it is wireless and comes with charger and love the quite clicks
0,mute button does not work
0,camping fishing yard work 
1,my daughter loved her new wireless keyboard
1,i bought this product because we are family of gamers that like to play on different consoles these headsets have been awesome and were easy to use the sound quality is great and really drowns out all outside distractions would definitely recommend 
0,easy to setup just plug in the usb and it works smooth cursor movement and clicking but the wheel does not scroll very well only moves the screen few lines and then it quits scrolling all together 
0,sound quality is surprisingly good just make sure you have the front facing you the battery lasts long time and the quality doesn turn to gsrbage when you turn the volume up this product is expensive but you get what you pay for 
1,i received the kotion each by bengoo headphones last christmas as gift thought for sure these were headphones when tried them on my ps they sounded great and gave my girlfriend peace because she now did not have to hear rdr constantly could fish ride horses hunt and have shootouts with outlaws all day long do not play online so cannot say to the microphone quality but have used it few times on zoom calls and no one had issues hearing me am also musician and filmmaker and am very picky about sound quality let be clear crystal clear get it these are not sennheiser headphones but they are very good quality for the price for casual use could not believe the price when looked them up would edit an album or film with these yes for rough cutting but would grab something more reputable for sound final mixing for video and definitely not use these for sound mixing music the mix coming out of these is little on the bass side for me but not enough one couldn get used to in few minutes and only know they are slightly bass because my ear is trained to hear that stuff most people will not notice this at all they have lasted just fine for year and are still going light plastic body but nothing has fallen off it yet also take very good care of my things and do not toss them on tables couches etc so cannot speak to how robust they are for people who like to throw things across rooms do not ever pull on the cord etc mine came with split connector mm usb which does come in handy sometimes but the extra dangly cord not being used can be annoying also the cord is waaaaay long feet ish which is great and also annoying depending on your usage but would take more cord than not enough any day the in line volume knob is great for when different streaming services like to pump out different volumes and your ears get blasted when your show starts no need to get up and change the computer volume just lay on the couch and adjust the dial on the cord reversely the dial is great to pump up the volume bit for those highly compressed videos on the web that are too low to hear overall it gets stars if it had treble bass adjustment knob it would get cheers to your ears 
1,works well easy to use stays charged for long time connects easily definitely good buy for the price
1,i don like using my mouse on my laptop so having mouse is helpful and then it lights up 
0,i have had for month and the roller broke what bummer

0,was nice until it stopped working after only few weeks wouldn buy this again not worth the money 
1,excellent product works right out the box
0,i really liked the keyboard used it for work and some gaming but it died on me few weeks later 
0,only complaint is they re slightly unconfirmed uncomfortable and doesn cover the whole ear especially when you swear bit but with every penny
0,i returned the jbl charge for two reason first to my ears the sound has too much bottom music sounds muddy and the higher end is lost due to too much bass unfortunately there no way to adjust the bass and treble what you hear is what you re stuck with the second reason for my return is the awful electronic sound effects that play automatically when you turn the device on or off regardless of your streaming volume these sound effects are loud and completely unnecessary 
0,hmmm
0,all the buttons are smooth but the space bar for some reason is loud and gets very annoying when you are typing sounds like it is loose 
0,i like it
0,don waste your time horrible quality and does not work with macbook air
0,not good don waste your money
0,while working with macbook pro frequently mouse is getting disconnected need to take the dongle out and then attach for reconnection wouldn recommend if you are using type port 
1,its great headset an very good for gaming love it
0,jbl uses non standard charging port if you misplace your cord none of the hundreds of other charging cords you have laying around will work knew about this and no surprise still managed to misplace it my tone is polite but actually seething about this tired old engineered money grab tactic thousands on thousands of other manufacturers chose standard readily available port and cord to hell with you for not doing the same at this stage in the game it just good sense and basic common courtesy 
0,don waste the time on this product yes the sound works and is okay but the mic came broken straight out the box don let the thousands of reviews fool ya
0,second one same issue the mouse wheel just stops working do not order this product learn from my mistakes 
0,i ve bought this headset multiple times now it is very good for the price but it has few problems the sound quality and microphone are good but the headset it not very comfortable for long gaming sessions and it is prone to breaking after constant use would recommend to anyone looking for cheap headset 
1,my great granddaughter likes them

0,it very cute but it lags and skips around lot unfortunately 
0,works fine nothing special and not quite as smooth as standard mouses you can get at big box stores for 
1,depending on what you want like in gaming keyboard this keyboard fits in well my husband loves it and have seen an improvement in his gaming it also has nice authestic with the lights the lights do not get crazy bright but are bright enough to notice and creates an atmosphere 
0,the mouse is fine but the scroll button started squeaking almost immediately and is pretty annoying 
1,this mouse is of great quality
1,great speaker love that can use it outside easy setup 
0,after few months of use obviously past the return window the scroll wheel on the mouse does not track any scrolls and spins almost like wheel on skateboard the led also stopped working if were to purchase again it would have to be considerably less with the frequency have to buy them 
0,i have never used it because everything is in chinese even the machine it self 
0,i like the quality of the microphone and the braided cord bought one of these about years ago and had no issues until accidentally cut the cord 
1,it perfect for me thin need gps tracker though the kids want it 
1,really in photo it looks more beautiful and of better quality than when you have it in personthe color has disappointed me since expected it to be more stylish and with better finishes 
1,good good good 
1,it is just ok product for me it could be more finished product but its not sometime it seems like its not clicking at all lights are good but for performance give it three stars 
1,i bought these for me and my boyfriend since we video call lot they are really good quality sound distance background noise but doesn silence it which like looks pretty cool however am returning them bc my boyfriend doesn like the extra usb cord for the light and it too bulky for his liking after seeing them in person saw complaints about the mic it works pretty well you just have to turn the volume up sometimesthe reason deducted stars was because got those for my phone and you can use them unless you take off the case the metal is not long enough otherwise

1,i travel for work so this wireless mouse is perfect it small for packing away and the sleep mode keeps it going longer charge it about every days 
1,this model is more so for bass if you love bass this speaker is perfect for you in every way however the quality of the actual sound could be improved it exactly like the reviews on youtube videos and the company videos explained with all of that said it worth the money and is loud if you are in middle school sized gym and it playing on apple music volume turned up completely it heard just saying it loud loud for house outside activities especially apartment bluetooth connects with no problem battery life last as promised for hours with non stop playing

1,great headset for cheap price 
1,at first this keyboard was everything wanted in wireless keyboard have always been skeptical of wireless keyboards it worked wonders at first but as started to work with it there would be very random connection issues where it would not register my typing this seller was kind enough to send me second keyboard even and the same issue was happening really do think it was an issue with my very many wireless electronics nearby but never found out what the issue was however gave this star rating because of how well it worked when it did and for the customer service don leave very many reviews but this seller really does deserve credit for great customer service experience as well as making great product however unfortunate it did not work for me they were even kind enough to send me gift for the inconvenience and gave me coupon voucher for their other products excellent service

0,product will not charge tried multiple outlets boxes cords product turns on for seconds has red light then shuts off junk 
0,worthless to spend min trouble shooting every time need to use it 
1,it is the loudest mouse have owned so far it makes weird internal noise that is high pitch hum the clicks are super loud the scrolling is loud it works great with macbook and does what is is suppose to but way too loud for me overall not fan and wouldn recommend 
0,worked literally for couple of minutes then stopped probably wouldn trust it with your apple products 
0,see title junk feels poor in your hand if no star button would rate it disapointed
1,i have been using the keyboard for several months now for occasional gaming absolutley love how quiet it is the connection is very easy battery life long have only charged it once and very comfortable to use wish the backlight stayed on longer though just bought another klim keyboard for work 
1,you could hear everything that is going on in game and the noise cancellation is amazing 
0,these do not work waste of money no sound at all 
0,shown new work with ps works barely but requires cord to be plugged into usb port for lights sound was terrible box condition showed headset had at best been repackaged at worst repaired sold as new don wast your time or money on these 
1,awesome speaker that plan on purchasing again for myself the one bought was for my girlfriend but hours battery life is straight up lie did mention the speaker sounds great with great bluetooth range and controls love this thing so much also my girlfriend probably doesn know the best practices of maintaining the longest battery life possible 
0,ok so am not super tech person and am not sure if this is fixable problem or not but only one side of the headphones work that was the whole reason on buying another pair of headphones because my first pair of different brand started to break and lose hearing in one side just opened mine and yet it has the same problem other than that they seem great just wished mine worked know 
1,quite cute and very portable
0,if you are like me and have trouble using usb to usb converters somehow always end up with flaky ones that don maintain connection be warned that this mouse uses the same method to support usb it comes with usb and usb adapter however you have to plug the usb into the usb adapter to use it you cannot use the usb adapter on its own which means have long double adapter sticking out of my computer just waiting to get knocked off had known up front that the usb adapter required the usb adapter to work would not have made this purchase 
0,scroll button stopped working within weeks
1,only worked for three days now won charge
1,i just purchased this mouse to use with my new laptop and am impressed with the quietness of the buttons and it has helped me win on my games
1,i bought this mouse for my work laptop the right click on the mouse is constantly getting stuck and the left click seems to take several pushes before it recognizes what it is supposed to do overall wouldn buy this again would definitely recommend spending allitle more and getting better mouse to get the job done 
1,my son loves these he said they are very nice and comfortable the sound is great he would give them stars 
0,for starters the box came cut up dont know the reason anyone would have to cut pff part of the product box maybe im being paranoid dont know also as you can see on the pictures the keyboard was totally dirty with dust stains some minor scratches here and there and what seems to be food crumbs under keys leads me to think this was being used already by seller previous to selling as brand new lights look cool amd it conmects fine to my laptop but the lack of hygiene is what got to me dont buy 
1,needed quality headset for good price works great 
0,update the company contacted me and sent me new headphone with mic it arrived few days ago and it works they mentioned they are sourcing their mic parts from new supplier hopefully their quality will improve my son used this for few hours each week for months then the microphone quit working the product has pathetic useful life put your dollars towards another headset this one is worthless 
1,i was looking for another headset because the one was using wasn working how it should and when saw this one with all the good reviews decided to try it and this headset rocks for the price love the sound dial and the mute switch use it for ps but the lights would be cool if were on pc pretty light weight and it overall seems like it decent quality headset would definitely buy again if something happens to this one 
1,he loves them
1,i loved this little mouse it looked great it felt great in my hand the wheel was nice for scrolling the battery even held charge for what thought was reasonable amount of time would categorize my usage as light moderate use and no abuse then came the day about month after arrival right after the return window closed that it started glitching now it drops off not responding then will work again then drop off again and not talking about sleep mode this is during active use back and forth back and forth it frustrating probably more because so desperately want mouse instead of my laptop trackpad all that said didn spend whole lot of money on this mouse so get what pay for just wish had gotten little more than month before the glitching 
0,it works okay but my scrool wheel doesn work and it never jad
0,sleek looking with lights but scroller on one did not work

0,the speaker or mic did not work 
0,the slim design fits well in my small hands
1,the wireless mouse worked well in the begining it was small but it fit in my hand well and the lights were nice though not necessary feature received it in september it wasnt something used every day about once or twice week in february the scroll wheel just broke it spins loosely and no longer scrolls on the screen do not use it often and am definitely not rough on it am dissapointed in the quality of this product 
0,used this mouse twice went to use it third time and it was completely dead the led were still working but the mouse light underneath flickers then shuts off after being turned on waste of money 
0,good job
1,i bought this mouse to replace an older one that had just cracked love the feature of charging them by usb in place of batteries so much more convenient easy to setup mouse clicks are completely silent which is also nice feature the changing led color light on the inside is just bonus that makes it looks cool comfortable use slim design and really like the no slip material of the mouse 
0,this speaker was great while it still worked kept it primarily in the same spot used it maybe minutes day was never rough with it and one day it just died on me doesn charge doesn power on ve owned bluetooth speakers that lasted me years and still work but this was complete waste of money

1,it good but for gaming don recommend this slim one it ok for normal work 
1,this is an excellent product it lightweight has very smooth rolling actio and love the way it looks highly recommend this mouse 
0,i was looking at this mouse when my cat jumped on my lap and hit the buy now button turned out to be pretty good mouse true story but she can write reviews so she may be little disappointed
1,i was skeptical at first that such small ergonomic mouse would work pleasantly surprised and have really enjoyed using it forgot to recharge it but it lets you know before it goes out by slowing down or moving from one screen to my other got it plugged in immediately and it kept right on working while it charged highly recommend this mouse and plan on buying another to have as backup for when forget to charge really love the color changing sequence the colors are bright but not overly so just enough to make it fun 
1,love the lights that shine thru very light and easy to pack for travel instant setup very pleased with this wireless mouse 
0,mouse does not take charge when it dies do not recommend this product to anyone 
0,i used this mouse for laptop it slowly stopped holding charge disappointed and happened after return item window closed

0,low quality and barely can hear anything had to get return cause it was worthless
1,the mouse clic is silent it feels very ergonomic at hand the battery lasts pretty good my daughter loves itthe lights are so nice specially at night with the room lights offgive it try
0,the usb receiver got stuck in my laptop usb port ended up having to get it out with pliers fortunately this didnt cause any damage to the usb port very disappointed in this product as the keyboard no longer works at all and it almost damaged my laptop the usb receiver came out in pieces at time and not sure if it even functioned properly to begin with it most definitely doesn function now 
0,if you are like me and have trouble using usb to usb converters somehow always end up with flaky ones that don maintain connection be warned that this mouse uses the same method to support usb it comes with usb and usb adapter however you have to plug the usb into the usb adapter to use it you cannot use the usb adapter on its own which means have long double adapter sticking out of my computer just waiting to get knocked off had known up front that the usb adapter required the usb adapter to work would not have made this purchase 
1,the mid and high range is bit lower than expected however the bass levels help compensate to deliver good sound this is fantastic for the back patio and beach battery life span ha snot been fully tested but in uses has thus far drained my cell phone faster than the speaker the port in back can help charge as well
1,i got these for my boyfriend birthday he loves them they for sure noise cancel because have to scream at him for him to hear me you would have to connect the light usb to power source if you re not gaming on computer but works great for his daily use 
1,bought this to use at work and absolutely love it not only are the changing colorful lights pretty cool it works really well however the best part about this mouse is that it is rechargeable bye bye batteries 
1,love love love 
0,my friend has one of these and they sound great never had any problem with fedex or ups but everytime it usps something gotta go wrong giving it star because never received mine 
0,battery last about hrs
1,they work as intended but sometimes they re weird you do get what you pay for the cord is obnoxiously long the microphone only works if have the switch perfectly in between the muted and not muted setting very odd the headset covers your whole ear so it doesn put pressure on them which is nice the headset itself is pretty big and clunky though definitely good purchase if you re casual gamer who just needs cheap headset had it for couple years and it works 
0,i like the headphones but they just don have the volume expected 
0,cheap easy to use and keeps up with your needs
0,many functions in many programs use ctrl shift ctrl shift does not work in any way on this keyboard this is unexpected and totally unacceptable behavior in keyboard these key combinations are intrinsic to many functions in windows it is time to return for refund darn liked the size and feel but functionality is compromised and need working keyboard not crippled one 
1,this product does what need it to do and does it perfectly super picky about stuff and can honestly say am very well pleased do believe have to turn it off for moment when it hibernates but that is whatever to me haha
0,use it for the video games 
1,absolute garbage day of using if you have it on the multicolor setting the mouse will not work should have known something was up when the instructions were only in mandarin it went straight to the trash can after couldn get it to work it also feels super cheap please if you re reading these reviews we re not lying do not buy this mouse 
1,product worked great and has good sound quality so far used mostly with ps and it connected easy and setup was straight forward 
1,easy to use and charge works with my chrome book any special effort plugged it in it works
1,i ordered this keyboard and used it for about weeks and then it just stops working would charge it for hours and it just won turn on it would turn on for like minutes and then immediately shuts off then emailed amazon and got replacement the replacement stopped working days in and it is the same issue it just somehow turns off and then would charge it and it just won stay on for more than mins returning both now and thats it 
1,works well hooked up immediately love the feels and the look 
0,i thought this mouse was really cool but then it broke the scrolly wheel thing doesnt move anymore it lasted like week and its not my main computer so it didnt get used much in that week 
0,it didn work with the switch had to return it
1,i really like this wireless light up keyboard have been searching for for awhile and glad decided on this 
0,don waste your money it worked well for few weeks long enough to miss the return window but then got jumpy erratic and wouldn hold charge unless plugged in 
1,this is cool wireless gaming keyboard love the fact that it lights up however it has an internal battery that needs to be charged too often 
0,repeatedly and without proper functioning my mouse turned on for second then turned right back off again after being plugged into the laptop overnight searched for power issue reviews and found am not the only one cannot recommend this product and feel it should be taken down due to this 
1,i have small hands and my old mouse was too big for my hand this mouse is lower so don need to move my wrist and fingers higher to click it not cure but it great that it fits my hand much better and doesn put as much strain on my hand 
1,i liked the she sound quality and how comfortable the headset overall feels 
1,bought it for my son great headset 
1,these made my grandson so happy right out of the box he loves the feel color and thinks they are the coolest ever love when can make my grand babies happy
1,love this mouse and the fact it goes to sleep of forget to turn it off even better don have to worry about batteries 
1,the mouse is slim and lightweight love the way that the inbuilt led light in the mouse changes its colors it is very easy to install the mouse on the laptop the day bought the mouse have been using it without charging the battery for days after surfing the mouse on amazon thought found the right mouse for my computer 
0,the mouse worked fine for maybe or hours with my pc laptop tried it on another laptop and desktop with same result the cursor moves intermittently and is not useable fully charged the mouse and tried with and without usb adaptor and no change 
1,great quality
1,i was tired of buying little cheap speakers that weren worth the money didn last very long and had terrible sound so decided to spend lot more for quality speaker got this for use by the pool it linked very easily to my phone the sound is great with plenty of bass can use it for several hours few days in row without worrying about the battery running down it seems to charge back up fairly fast too so glad spent the money on this totally pleased with my purchase 
1,this is the best purchase have ever spent 
1,it started out great for about days now it works for minutes and won move the cursor around 
1,i am old school when it comes to navigating the screen work much faster with wireless mouse everything about this mouse is great except you gotta to charge it mouse that require batteries work for very long time months in fact the charge on this mouse doesn last long have to remember to turn it off when not using it also have to remember to plug it into charge after long use starts acting sluggish as power runs down my old mouse is years old wanted cool new one to match my new laptop this one has soft smooth click the led lights are really fun however threw away the box before tried it out would send it back if had kept shipping material ll just keep the old one close when the new one is charging so much for progress i
0,it looks good and like the lighted keys when need to use my computer at night for short time no longer have to turn on the light 
1,the mouse is really pretty but the battery life is super short it doesn even last my hr workday after full charge 
1,happy with this speaker not too heavy and the bass is just about right for me similar in sound to sony old mega bass option 
0,i used this product to listen to music
1,i bought this headset in may and loved it up until now in august and the mic barely works seems as though the internal mute switch is stuck on worked great up until this point so very disappointed 
0,ergonomic for gaming
1,not extremely loud but bass is good pair and its worth the buy 
0,the keyboard when it lights up makes strange high pitched buzz hearing that none stop would definitely cause headache in addition the keys are very loud especially the spacebar it does look pretty cool when lit but there is no way could have handled the buzz none stop 
0,trash for ps doesn even fit all the way in to the controller and you might be wondering why are plunging it into the controller cause the damn thing for the ps for itself doesn event work
1,i was initially in love with this mouse however soon after while scrolling the mouse stopped scrolling you don realize how something so small you really see crucial everything works for the scroll to just stop literally want to throw the whole mouse out and probably will decided to hold on to it cause it just so cute and matches my laptop however soon after the sensor and clicker stopped working as well now forced to get new mouse 
0,the noise canceling is false at first when used them they were good owned pairs of these and the same problem happened with both after while the sound only goes to one side you have to mess with the volume adjustment to get both sides to work if you move it even little it only works on one side again will not be buying again
1,great sound quality 
1,i ve had this wireless keyboard for almost month this is my first one because my brother was the one that recommended this to me had get used to the backlit lights not being on all the time but overall this is an excellent wireless keyboard and have not had an issue with it it came undamaged and it arrived quick and the customer service at klim has excellent customer service 
1,perfect just what needed 
1,the headsey is very good for gaming the mic works great people on the other side have said they can hear me more clearly and can hear them more clearly with the amazing sound quality and when put it on and play something can almost always only hear whats in the headset over all would definitely buy this again 
0,battery life is horrible on this mouse won last more than minutes thought it was fluke and got replacement because the mouse is comfortable and cool looking but the second one they sent me was even worse with whopping minute battery life after full charge 
1,it is my son gift my son love it very much 
1,great headset for xbox gaming
0,when leave the mouse alone for couple of minutes and then start using it the mouse is really slow have trying everything to fix it need new mouse now
0,upon receiving the mouse charged it with the charging cable used it for considerable amount of time and plugged it in upon plugging it in there was an odd smell the smell was the cable starting to melt unplugged it and will not be using it again lucky that didn walk away or my place could have caught on fire what disappointment 
1,great sound
1,i love this keyboard use it for work connect it to tablet to type my reports it works great and love the different colors of the back lit keyboard 
0,my son uses it for gaming and he likes it 
1,work well great value so far
0,i haven used the sleep mode and don do gaming
1,i love this keyboard can easily see the keys in the dark and the lighting effect is calm and inspirational 
0,these are pretty good headphones but for some reason others can hear me when speak
1,i bought this for my year old he goes through headsets like crazy this one was incredibly affordable hopefully it will last great customer support from the company so far 
0,so good 
0,light up can be used unless its plugged in so it can be used with the gaming controllers
1,i bought this keyboard for my software engineering job and it is great for emails programming etc its also great for gaming as well highly recommend this product also great customer service 
0,the cable has fault near the volume control this leads to one side not working didn expect much from cheap set of headphones but come on 
1,nothing these speakers are as good as if not better than bose speakers for the price these speakers sound absolutely amazing other than saying very happy with my decision to buy these speakers for the quality sound and price people highly recommend you run out and buy yourself jbl harman speakers bought two for myself one for my boat by the way the other morning was fishing listening to my favorite pink floyd dark side of the moon while inside this little cove the sound just exploded it was like the acoustics was all around me people just one little speaker sitting on the console of my boat sounded like had thousand dollar set up for the money highly recommend this little gem promise you won be disappointed 
1,i purchased this speaker over other portable options specifically because it had an aux input when using this input the speaker has the brilliant design of shutting off when the signal falls below certain threshold this threshold is very high and the the shut off happens basically immediately the result is continuous stuttering of whatever you re listening to which is absolutely unbearable searching online many people experience this some are able to solve it by cranking up the volume all the way up this didn work for me apparently you can remove resistor on the circuit board to disable this built in feature but just returned my unit instead jbl was useless when it came to customer support won be purchasing any products from them in the future and don recommend you do either 
1,the mouse itself is great works well however the roller ball on the top of the mouse broke and no longer works it has only been weeks since purchase do like that the lights have an on off function so you don need to have it lit all the time which makes it more appropriate when in work environment 
0,my first internal battery mouse liked the ergonomics but the charging was more frequent than would have liked the mouse was thrown in landfill mere months old because the wheel broke mouse not really going to miss you 
1,it was so pretty for the first few hours after charging with the changing lights and standby light mode then the next morning after turning it off it would not turn back on so put it on the charging cord for days and nope nothing save your money and purchase something else and make sure it takes batteries this is garbage that has pretty face on it if still had the box it came in would be getting full refund and send it back 
1,i have had it for almost month and it sounds great was nervous because other reviews stated that what they received was not real well this one was and it sounds great plenty of sound to do the job charges quick and is very portable 
0,lightweight nice looking wireless fair price but it stopped working after less than year really liked this keyboard but dealing with keyboard that is outputting constant characters to the computer and can imagine how to fix it if turn this on it locks up my computer and tries typing numbers and odd ascii characters shame 
0,stays charged
1,love this very sleek very quiet and actually love the lighting on the sides have had no issues plug and play 
1,perfect my son loves them
0,excellent feel but no warning when battery about to die which negates it for competitive gaming enter key also has horrible design and placement for work the dongle does not work if using kvm switch or if direct line of sight is not allowed if you can snag used one for less than new price it may be worth it but would not buy again 
0,mine stopped working it doesn work on mouse pad and freezes when use it on top of flat surface 
0,your telephone sound quality is better then this speaker before you do mistake and waste your time think to get something else
0,this didn last months before it stopped taking charge will not be buying another one 
1,great
0,lights doesn stay on
1,love it and the colors 
1,fantastic
0,he stated it was sooooooooooooo gooooooooooood
0,just wished it ll light up without being plugged in
0,the top is not opaque like the photos it translucent there is only one lighting mode there is no rainbow effect on the edge like the photo 
0,scroll wheel broke after very light use would not recommend would have been nice mouse otherwise 
1,love it
1,excellent thin size prefer this new wireless for its thinness and rechargeability 
1,i ve never used this as game if mouse but did use it for my kindle fire hd and it was perfect used it just like would for labtop and it worked out so well
0,it good size weight and shape but it bothers me that you can turn the red light off when you move it if you have the rainbow light on the red light still goes on when you move it so you don really get the rainbow effect
0,i use it on the golf course and boating
1,works great only use the usb to connect it to my ps and no problems so far using the wireless 
0,it really waste of money bought it in august and started falling apart end of sept and completely broke in nov not worth the money 
1,this is user friendly works well and holds charge for long time would buy it again
1,it nice product but expected better sound ive looked at them in best buy they were awesome had known this wasn what expected wouldn have bought it 
1,really nice headset the only note ve got is if you are using this for ps the usb placement to power up the lights on the headset is right next to the audio jack like connected away not very practical and you have to put usb extension on it if you want to power up the lights could care less about the lights so ve got high marks for this great noise cancellation sound is crisp and headset is very comfortable 
0,a rechargeable cordless mouse is such good idea and invention you don have to deal with batteries and this mouse seemed not to need recharging for over day great this one bought worked well even though it did something odd and am not sure if it was the mouse or the inexpensive tablet computers that use or maybe the usb splitters that use however it was probably the mouse but after using the mouse normally for few hours the mouse would then not show the arrow on the screen and found that would have to turn off the swatch on the mouse and then turn it back on again it was as if had to re boot the mouse periodically it seemed to have nothing to do with recharging this would happen even after the mouse had been fully recharged it would be unpredictable as to when it would happen but overall even that was minor flaw but then one day actually the date of this writing march put the mouse receiver into different receptacle to use different tablet computer and it would not work no matter what tried to do then decided to take out the receiver from the usb receptacle and found that the metal square part on the receiver stuck into the usb receptacle so this leads me to believe that possibly the mouse receiver became faulty with regular use over few weeks since bought it otherwise the way that the receiver was made was not in the best possible way not rugged enough maybe however though don know at this point if this is the way that all these rechargeable mouses are this brand or if this particular one that bought just did not actually pass quality control at the factory it seems the company should give me replacement am going to see about it but guess will be told that the deadline for returns had been reached will update if am able to 
1,i have bought the clips speaker for working in the yard and to put on my golf bag also purchased jbl big and jbl charge all are excellent speakers can connect and large speakers not available for clips 
0,i had this mouse for about week use it for work and once it died used the cable it came with to charge it left it plugged in for few hours and now it wont turn on at all it flashes red and turns off waste of money

1,bought this for my son for christmas and so far so good honestly it times better then what expected sound bass and battery life is actually great very pleased with this purchase 
0,this is the nd set we have purchased and they both stopped working within months 
1,wonderful product best key board have ever used dont spend hundreds of on other ones 
0,the mouse does well use it daily for work it lasts long time between charges and puts itself to sleep when am not using it so battery is not wasted sometimes can go weeks without charging my only complaint is the wheel have had it about months and the wheel started squeaking recently people can hear it in my calls and it sometimes drives me nuts this is my rd wireless mouse the other were different kinds and the wheel stopped working at all was common complaint on those 
1,we have this speaker in blue great speaker gift recipient wanted yellow not even close gold at best maybe basketball orange didn go through the hassle of returning 
1,absolutely love it
0,it hi quality
1,it is great product for what paid for it is more durable than thought and give the extra boost was looking for 
1,super good 
1,perfect for gaming watching shows on his kindle or listening to music 
0,when first got this keyboard noticed that my passwords were often wrong though knew had typed them correctly missing keys started showing in browsers and and applications alike there was no rhyme or reason to it about of key strokes just didn appear sometimes angrily pressing the same key or times in row produced no result thought that it might be low battery without the warning light even when left the usb cable plugged in all the time performance did not improve if you use this keyboard for gaming you will suffer lots of premature death if you use it for work you will suffer crippling frustration am using mine as paper weight having switched back to an old dell keyboard that came with my tower pc years ago the battery life did not impress even with the brightness somewhat muted the tactile feedback is poor too it just always had an un satisfying feel 
1,finally sleep mode that is done right all my other wireless mice when they go to sleep you have to click to wake pretty standard well when wake those other mice with right or left click it is active click which means it acts as if it was never asleep and either opens menu or activates what clicked always frustrated me lol well this one is super nice you click and it awake without doing an activation or selection have been looking for this in wireless mouse and have finally found it also it has nice feel not super ergonomic but nice the color selection is nice chose the grey the rgb lights are very pleasant to the eyes haven had it long enough to rate the length of the internal rechargeable battery but will update soon the cable that comes with the mouse is very short but that isn problem the dbi variety is nice as well very happy with this mouse 
0,i ve had for lass than month and it already doesn work anymore left it on for couple hours while was away fully charged and working perfectly when left and when came home it refused to work have charged it have taken out the usb and reinserted it and have turned it off and on million times and it just doesn work anymore am so incredibly disappointed and upset that this broke after less than month and cannot return it as don have the original packaging anymore would give negative stars if could wish could get my money back to buy different mouse but unfortunately can anymore don waste your money on this

0,wish it was bigger using it out by the horseshoe pit and in my room at night it sounds great but it not enough sound to rock the block battery life is shorter then what they say but probably lasts long enough to get thru whatever your doing 
1,i just recently got into using mouse and keyboard for fps games such as cod and this is my first keyboard overall good keyboard keys are firm but press easy some buttons are shaped different than usual but that makes it easier to use them ie the enter button sweet color display goes into sleep mode after about minutes of not use to conserve battery but shoots right on as soon as you hit button over good keyboard works with xbox one

0,i wanted to do stars on this but do have slight issue with the design of the keyboard itself it may be the best keyboard you have owned really ve just broken so darn many it unfunny not this model yet my main gripe is the whole function key is right side only which wouldn be horrible for me if wasn consistently used to handed volume and media controll may have just bought the wrong keyboard there are other options this is the one bought and it was bucks and not pleased with it due to this again may work wonders for you non media junkie

1,perfect size for small hands
1,great for price 
0,mouse worked fine for two weeks shape took some getting used to since it low profile charge held up pretty well but the scroll wheel broke after few weeks of use so in the trash it goes 
0,wireless rechargeable keyboard
0,mostly good but can move the mic any closer to my face 
1,the reason why got it is so could do party chat on the ps since my earpods didn work at all with my ps tried it out and the audio works brilliantly and it easy to adjust and turn on and off the mic although did want it also for the light up function that it is and it was bit disappointing when needed to also plug it into usb port so the lights would turn on just glad that have converter for my macbook so could plug it to my laptop as well as my controller although wish could make it longer the spot where the two plug ins are so won have to sit so close to my laptop just to get both features that want 
0,gets insensitive very quickly and it so hard to use light and small and not ergonomic at all dont recommend buying
1,i bought the keyboard for my boyfriend it awesome great to use in the dark although when the lights are pulsating the keyboard does make ringing sound other than that it was really easy for him to adjust from his old keyboard to this one and we ve charged it once for like minutes and it been working for days of use so the battery life is great definitely nice product

0,mouse is very lagging even after full charge 
0,this item shuts off and on while you re using it have to smack it onto my desk to get it to wake up piece of junk
1,a little difficult trying to tie to of them together finally found the trick turn both on let them automatically connect to phone one connected hit the stereo mode buttons at same time for me it worked every time have to buy two atleast because in stereo mode they sound great bass is decent not as much as like but they have great sound quality so if your sound quality and not bass person these are good

1,klim customer service is amazing first keyboard got wouldn connect and became dud within weeks of use they sent brand new one and it been perfect still use it and it good for generic typing however after continuous everyday use for hours week ve begun to choose to only use it on days may be less busy typing less quickly the longer use it or the more have to quickly type it will glitch out it adds unnecessary keys know did not hit or will duplicate key stroke hello looks like heelloo all in all good witless keyboard love that it can be charged with cord battery life is great wakes up quickly and has good response time after sleeping it just can be expected to put up with long intermittent time frames of over wpm typing 
1,amazing value was worried about the input delay playing games like dota or tarkov but there is honestly no delay it could also be that not pro gamer by any means and just not good enough to notice it either way 
0,excellent sound good build quality supports aux in annoying feature turns sound off if volume low but acceptable workaround turn up volume on device app is only to connect multiple speakers no other features for me not an issue 
1,for the price product is good does what it says it will do easy to use recommended good quality and stylish
1,i always wanted mouse which is similar to the apple one and found this to use for my windows laptop its very stylish rgb light looks pretty cool like the sleep feature it goes to sleep pretty quickly saving the battery and also that the mouse is rechargeable

1,i got this when it was on sale for off and consider myself to have been ripped off this keyboard sucks it sometimes works sometimes it doesnt even keeping it plugged in defeating the whole purpose of wireless keyboard doesn guarantee it will work the lights are cool or whatever but they don make up have unconscionably awful it is even something as simple as writing this review is taking three times longer than it should do not buy you have been warned keep looking there are better products from better companies do yourself favor spend that extra thirty seconds spend the same money and get working product 
0,had for less than month and will not work keeps turning off
0,stopped working after month
1,great quality
1,i love this mouse cause it has really cool lights and really like that it petite and lightweight 
0,i would not recommend this keyboard to anyone in humid environment after few weeks or single small water spill many of the keys start typing the desired letter with number in front at no control to the typer 
0,i would not recommend this keyboard loved it at first until the keys started breaking just from typing broken keys in the first month alone
1,the sound is amazing for such smaller product it produces lot of sound 
1,don know why they just stopped working after month can still hear and but no voice and they aren really that comfortable nor are they that bright 
1,i love this mouse got the pink gold rose one it first of all so elegant and the best part is that it mute the clicks are soft and smooth 
0,the there is only speaker facing the front and its reall small battery life is not hr maybe on lowest setting with an aux use this at work on volume when using bluetooth will last only hr
0,got mouse for my son the light look cool and it was comfortable no complaints until the trackball quit working after about days contacted the company they communicated well and replaced it very quickly about week later the same thing happened again great communication and no issues with refund so good communication but not the best mouse

1,the headphones work very well and are comfortable to wear 
1,outstanding product and customer service thanks 
1,i got this for my daughter for school it is perfect and appeals to her teenage likes
1,i wanted to find slim wireless mouse similar to mac magic mouse without the high price tag while this certainly isn magic mouse it pretty good substitute for fraction of the cost there are some tradeoffs of course due to the slim nature of this mouse it is extremely lightweight not built like tank and sometimes the buttons require sturdy click to ensure response but all in all happy with my purchase it looks nice works well and it has gone about months so far without needing recharge speaking of which leave the mouse on all the time and it goes into sleep mode no big deal just realize you need to click button to wake it up once you power on your laptop or desktop otherwise it will seem like the mouse isn working also ve had couple of instances where had to reinsert the usb adapter to get it to reconnect but that was maybe times in the past couple of months in short recommend this product the company provided great support when received the wrong color mouse and they ve been top notch to deal with they stand behind their product 
1,i use it for work time keeping and it does everything need it to light for caps lock ease of inputting shortcuts comfortable for typing since it has two stands in the back lights up so can see the keys when don feel like turning on the lights in my office great product
0,works right out of the box has the charging cable and both usb options so you can use it on different comps older and new the lights are really cool too 
1,i am fan on jelly bean type of mouse had previous jelly bean mouse that ended up giving to family member and was searching for another one to replace it and came across this one the lights is the one that did the trick for me here just love the lights other than that its nice light mouse could have been little shorter its longer mouse compared to my previous one but other than that very functional and light and can be carried in the pockets to meetings in offices which is what do primarily with this one 
1,i think this is great price quality product
0,mouse worked fine for months charged it every week or so then wouldn charge via usb not good option for those who need something reliable 
1,my son loves these headphones
1,nice feel and touch fits the hands properly hopefully there will be type upgrade to these things
0,could not have been wrong in ordering this speaker
1,this speaker works good enough for me unlike most bought this because it was directional speaker use it while welding in the shop and don want everyone to have to listen to my music too it stays away from me and can hear my music just fine the battery will last all day even at high volume unless you try to charge your phone with it got hrs with my phone plugged in for half that time without using it to charge my phone got hrs out of it and it was only down one dot out of overall the sound is decent worth the money if you get it on sale 
1,the product is very good for gaming the ability to plug into your controller is helpful 
1,worked great for months then deader than hammer will not charge tried everything resets cables everything buyer beware 
1,overall great 
0, and on time
1,keyboard is directly as advertised it responds fast with no lag the ability to change some of features using fn is just an added bonus keys are very comfortable honestly like gaming on it better than the expensive gaming keyboards works very well for me 
0,i have this mouse for days and now it just doesn charge no idea why and ve tried everything do not buy it cheap 
1,i originally heard this thing at christmas someone else got one as gift listening to them test it out it put out some amazing sound from such small device it does sound great but there are technical glitches that are really irritating the first second of sound cuts out until it wakes up from its bluetooth soft sleep like state guessing it to save battery life it supposed to have an app to tailor all kinds of controls but after installing it it refused to recognize the speaker no matter what did it paired fine can play music to it from my phone but communication with the app nope little bit of user oriented testing would ve gone long way here 
1,i bought this speaker for our boat it works perfectly we take it lots of places now love the sound quality and it is so easy to use 
1,it was given as gift because already own one and she loves it 
1,ok tried everything in the world to get this keyboard to work plugged the dongal into the usb port charged it up overnight and finally restarted the computer looked at the bottom of the keyboard and saw nothing but there is very tiny button that blends in with the rest of the keyboard which is in the off position when it first arrives turn the button on this message is for people who haven had to buy new keyboard in million years like me hope it helps all the non techie people out there love the colors on the keyboard and because of my set up the keyboard is in fairly dark area in pull out beneath the desk so this is really really helpful very light to the touch as advertised not gamer but you don have to be to appreciate this keyboard 
1,great quality for the price 
0,doesn stay charged long and some functions don work 
0,it was very helped
0,not great battery life and not for loud listening 
1,love it you should get one great battery life ve had it for months and use it everyday and have only charged it twice 
0,was working fine then surly the clicker in the middle stoped working
1,keys were really nice and slim the letter inside was also delightful it been months and still haven had to charge it it great 
1,i use this with my desk top mac like it way better than the glass apple mouse can actually utilize more features with it too on the right click glides easy and have had no problems with it which is more than can say for the apple mouse years with apple products which love but their mouse is crappy design looks good but who cares this one is reasonably priced great price actually for what you get give this mouse two thumbs up 
0,it charges very fast battery lasts long time they still haven designed better charging port the flap pushes on the cable causing weakness in the charge replaced my for the after the sound started getting strange the has the same issue 
0,my speaker wont charge and just purchesed it owned other jbl speakers but this is the first time get defetive product
0,it stopped working
1,i am very happy with this mouse the colors are interesting and the fact that don have to buy batteries is an added plus 
0,i used it for about six weeks and it stopped working
1,works great in laptop very aesthetically pleasing ready to use and install
0,this is by far the wosrt head set ve yet to get only two weeks in and absolutely despised it the mic is way to far away from your mouth even with sensitivity all the way up my friends could barely hear me it fixed mic all it can do is go up and down far to stiff feels like vice around my head mic quality is garbage sounds canny and fuzzy honestly you can buy better headsets for the same price not as good but better than this dumpster fire of headset at least it ll make decent target practice
0,i took chance and bought this headset cause of the many good reviews but it by far the worst headset ever gamed with walmart headset was better then this crap it hurts my ears there only sound from the left side the right doesn have any sound at all and it extremely loud and staticky and if lower volume to try to hear people better in the game it just goes mute 
1,i love these headphones they re perfect for my ps thanks 
0,loved it while it worked yet here we are two months later and it literally just stopped working ve tried multiple usb ports to no avail guess you get what you pay for
0,for my laptop and received it the next day 
1,they are great
0,the sound quality far exceeds the price of the speaker battery life is exceptional and the bluetooth connectivity could not be easier highly recommend this speaker 
0,works well worth it
1,i wanted wireless mouse and this one fit my needs it is rechargeable and can be turned off which helps save battery power it can also be used while the charging cable is plugged in if necessary the colors are great touch and use them depending on the mood in at the time also like being able to choose the resolution on the fly with the button on the top have already recommended it to couple of friends 
0,so there is no way to turn off the sleep mode the point of lit keyboard was to see the keys after sixty seconds the light turns off and have to hit random key to get the light on that makes the entire purchase waste asked for lit keyboard because needed keyboard that would be lit this is not lit for more than minute at time it an unlit lit keyboard 
0,i like that can cancel out all the background noise and distractions when play on my ps 
1,pretty flimsy but still good mouse for the price 
0,two stars because the ear cuffs are soft volume key doesn do much at all for the volume literally played audio through my projector because couldn get any games sound loud enough on the headset 
0,broke after months we were satisfied untill they broke 
1,i love the speaker but it didn come with usb cable like the description says nor did it have the manual the only thing got in the box was the speaker and that it 
1,works great surprisingly it is also durable my year old used them and throws them around 
1,this mouse meets all my needs and it looks so cute among my setup love the rgb lights it projects and how smooth and quiet the clicks are definitely recommend 
0,bluetooth connection of the speaker is very annoying it gets disconnected often times and also delivery of the music is slow

0,just by the logitech and skip the savings from this cheap import bought this to replace wired mouse on my kvm switch and it worked great for two months would plug in to charge using an open usb port on my switch was super convenient turning it off every night while it charged the next day unplug and flip it to the middle setting so lights were not on constantly and was able to use for the whole day hrs no problem then about two weeks ago same usual routine go to use the next day and completely dead revert back to wired mouse and let it charge until lunch hrs later swap back out lights come on for about seconds and again completely dead now out of the return policy not even months later and screwed 
1,love our new speaker but downsides it not as loud as we figured it would be good sound indoors but not nearly loud enough outdoors also sometimes it connects to phone first try but other times it takes much longer and is very hard to connect same with pairing it to another jbl speaker

1,update seller has contacted me asking me to remove my review and attempting to bribe me with money to do so expected this as several other comments say they too received the same bribery they even went as far as sending me here how to remove link purchased this as an upcoming christmas gift for my sister as it was similar to one she wanted that is not available right now the box for the mouse is mostly in another language and paired with the price that prompted me to test it before wrapping it up and giving it to her come the holiday let me just say am glad that did while the mouse powered on and worked fine with the usb dongle that it requires be plugged in to use decided to test it other feature of being able to charge it while using it everything worked fine until unplugged it once unplugged the micro usb cable from the mouse my entire pc turned off thought maybe it was just fluke so tested it again nothing happened the second time so plugged it back in for little bit to make sure it had full charge on it for her and when unplugged it to re package it it happened again as to say am now running virus detecting software to err on the side of caution and this product is getting returned as defective moral of the store don buy cheap products

0,i ve been throwing pair of these in pools hot tubs the lake my favorite party trick is the bass spraying water off the sides when you take it out of the water yes these are mono thats why you buy two and they pair up with just single button press on each you do have to use the jbl app to marry them into stereo mode but hell you can even sync bose speakers without an app my only complaint with these they don play music under water lol seriously get two you won be disappointed the battery wore out in my renewed one bought for can complain because it owes me nothing and ordered an upgraded battery for it for which brings it to the full price of one of these after beating on it for years literally beating on it taking them everywhere

0,the keyboard lights up beautifully it just never works with the computer complete waste of money 
1,got these as an intended upgrade for previous headset got from walmart wasn expecting much but wish had kept the walmart headset now that ve tested these they work just fine for video playback no real complaints there my main issues are how incredibly cheap they feel and how crummy the microphone is the store page claims it has noise isolation to better pick up your voice but from my basic voice recording tests comparing my laptop and this microphone my laptop consistently provides louder clearer results compared to this headset there was still quite noticeable background noise in the headset recording as well there also some design flaws with how the microphone is implemented it is completely rigid peice of plastic that only rotates vertically so it just ends up hanging good to inches from your mouth when deployed yes got out ruler and measured it that off this is compared to other headset mics which can be adjusted as needed to sit much closer and in front of your mouth instead of beside it the cheap feeling is the next biggest flaw simply put the glossy plastic used on the exterior of the muff housing reminds me of cheap toy the case on the connecting band is bit better being made from matte plastic but not by much the only things on this device that don feel like they were slapped together for as low material cost as possible are the ear mouths and the braided cord which comes with nice plastic protectors for both the mm audio jack and the usb that powers the contractually obligated gamer lights have honestly forgone the lights for better build quality on the muff housing and microphone that actually somewhat flexible so can actually hear myself speak overall average playback quality nothing that would impress an audiophile but nowhere near terrible it painfully average and unfortunately that more than can be said for the rest of the device bad microphone design and quality just don bother got better results from the built in microphone array in my thinkpad from than did with this thing el cheapo feel like toy from dollar store verdict if you care about quality in your headset don buy this they sell this thing for at regular price got it for about half off with the amazon prime discount even still somewhat regret spending money on this thing and be leagues more disappointed had paid the full asking price for it it barely worth it weight at ish dollars and there no way it worth the normal if you just want something for discreet audio playback go find better headset or just settle for some earbuds there plenty of decent options for the latter under both in retail stores and online this one isn worth your time or your money the only reason even keeping this is because returning products has always been pain in my experience and because the headset itself technically works but that it it not even worth the hassle of chasing down refund 
1,this is the perfect headset for gaming 
1,super quiet keys and great feeling makes my setup up look extra clean without all the wires
0,gift for teen not sure how to rate it 
1,works great for work super comfy even with my glasses

1,so far my husband is loving it would prefer non colored mode 
1,when bought it expecting it to last more than month then last week noticed something wasn right sure enough the end oof the wire that plugs into the pc was breaking and really was happy with it at first not having to buy batteries for it 
1,i bought the white one and at first it was only lighting up red and thought the picture was misleading then realized the on off switch on the bottom actually serves two functions one click on will turn the mouse on and glowing red two clicks on and the rainbow colors appear will say the white mouse is almost translucent the rainbow colors illuminate the whole mouse not just the sides it plug and play very easy to use and comfortable 
1,really amazing headphones for beginner gamers it has really good sound quality mic quality and overall good quality in general definitely would recommend to anyone for cheap bang for your buck headset 
1,update lost my favorite mouse today bought it on jun reviewed it aug and it died yesterday aug so the mouse lasted appx weeks two and half months is pretty disappointing lifespan the battery died so plugged it in as always yet it doesn connect anymore ve tried removing the usb transmitter rebooting the computer plunging it in and out and turning it off and on but nothing even tried re charging it but nope it lost cause bought this mouse to replace the wireless logitech was using for my laptop it died and decided to try this rechargeable mouse from okimo never heard of the brand but impressed this first charge lasted so long that almost forgot it was rechargeable bought it in mid june it aug today and just on my second charge the first charge lasted over month this mouse does shut off after it idle for while and sure that is the secret to the long battery life just quick left click and it back in business almost immediately love the slim feel of this mouse it works beautifully thought the changing light would bother me old but it doesn it more like pleasant subdued highlight effect ll probably buy another one for my desktop but in another color so don get them mixed up

0,these headphones are awful static every time you move not worth rather spend and get something decent
1,this is the best wireless mouse ve ever used the flat profile keeps my arthritic hand from getting stiff and sore after long use the colors are subtle enough to be fun but not intrusive if you plan to use it with desktop computer be aware that the charging cord is very short so using the mouse while charging may be problem use it with laptop where this is not an obstacle the mouse appears very well made and sturdy

0,the first day received the product it worked very well though couldn get seem to get it to charge it had enough juice to get through the first day so wasn too concerned by the second day though something had happened to the optical portion because moving the mouse often wouldn move the cursor and never moved it as fast as it should the buttons all seem to work fine still but without the ability to actually move the mouse as want to it pretty useless 
1,didn buy this for gaming but it smooth mouse which love work from home and utilize this while on my work and home lap tops 
1,got two of these with colors that matched out tablets easy to transport and just right feel in my hand so far they work perfectly and at what would consider great price 
1,received on time and enjoyed chatting with friends while playing ps these headphones are awesome no hiccups work as intended and am super satisfied with my purchase and will recommend this product thank you bengoo 
1,i should have got this long time ago now feel like can keep up with my gaming group without driving my partner crazy super comfortable and stylish definitely grateful to have received this as gift 
0,really needed new headset and this was exactly what needed
0,not worth the value
0,not the greatest but works
0,you get about hours use time on this and then you have to charge it up separately not worth the trouble 
0,noticed that after long period of wear the outside of my ears start to hurt 
0,it was fine to use at first but it stopped working after about month of using it consistently not impressed with longevity 
1,to charge have to press down on the cord where it plugs into the mouse and hope for the best scroll wheel clicks are loud 
0,owned for month and spacebar is already sticking 
1,when turned it on and the back lights appeared in beautiful rainbow pattern was blown away it is such nice keyboard am definitely impressed with this product upon first receipt what love best about the product is everything really the keys are soft and comfortable with the exception of the space key love how quiet these keys are can type discreetly without being too loud love that the lighting is adjustable both in pattern and brightness the breathing mode is very neat feature and like that can adjust the speed of it it has calming effect but also like that can keep the lights on all the time or even turn them off completely if don want them on the wireless feature is neat because can take it anywhere and position it anywhere and don have to worry about plugging it in like the little legs on the bottom so can raise the keyboard up or leave it flat if want it to be more or less ergonomic the battery display is great feature because can tell when need to plug it in before it loses power also like that the dongle that plugs into the computer has little nook on the back of the keyboard so they can stay together when not in use on the instructions pamphlet at the very end it says thinks for reading it should say thanks for reading it obvious that great care was taken to create high quality product so it disappointing to see such careless error one other thing don care for is how loud the space bar is all the rest of the keys are soft and hardly make sound but when tap the space bar it makes loud plastic sound that seems to resonate throughout the room for how often it gets used was hoping it would be bit quieter other than those two things wouldn change anything this product is very easy to use the instructions were incredibly helpful and well written it nice to see the instructions written out in so many languages it gives the impression that this is worldwide company and because of that very successful it gives the company lot of credibility the instructions were easy to read and follow like that the function keys are explained and there is even an illustration of the keyboard with keys labelled so they are easy to find on the real keyboard absolutely love this keyboard and would recommend it to all of my friends whether you have laptop or desktop computer this keyboard is not only great to look at it works very well there is an incredible value for the money here have several klim products in my office and love each one am satisfied with this company and will definitely purchase products from them again

1,mouse was great for about hours when it stopped working mouse even snake would not like worthless 
1,great device
0,overall it is good keyboard but it runs out of battery really fast my own does not hold on for more than or days would expect to hold the battery for or weeks or even months every week have to connect into the usb port to recharge when connected to usb port still have to connect the bluetooth adapter which makes me use an extra usb port why not just use the usb cabe to also communicate with the pc why do have to use both while charging the keyboard

0,all good
1,is great 
0,this mouse quit working after weeks poor quality returned 
1,great
0,i have already ordered the black one and liked it so much orderer another one for my laptop 
0,its pretty it ergonomic its rechargeable no batteries but and its big but the charge wears off in about day and it takes to hours to recharge and you have to keep track of the charging cord the charge dissipates without warning this is very annoying glad kept my old mouse not sure keeping this perhaps its matter of habitually charging it overnight like phone guess glad not gamer having it quit on me at crucial time in the game would be disaster 
1,i was scared to purchase this speaker so glad did the this speaker works great sounds great 
0,worked when first charged it once the charge ran down it wouldn charge again 
0,haven really used it much yet 
1,very bright sound quality and feedback is on point no lagging voices recommend 
1,the sound is great and totally meets my needs
1,i like that it recharges and doesn require batteries it doesn last that long though but seems to recharge good enough after only being plugged in for even minutes wish it came with longer charge cord since you could then use also with charging cable plugged in still can but very short cord 
1,great speaker exactly as described new sealed from factory super fast shipping 
0,i bought this mouse twice because wasn able to return them in time due to mailing issues thought the first one must be an error since it broke after hours of use guess how long the second mouse lasted hours absolute crap product and wasted my money
1,ergonomic would also like to have full size for desktop use multi color led adds nice decorative touch mouse wakes up from sleep mode with first click 
1,great
1,after one full charge and the charge running out the battery won hold charge ll leave it plugged in for hours to charge only for it to die in about minutes of use definitely better products out there 
1,the mouse worked well for day but nowhere cursor is non responsive checked to make sure it was fully charged did some troubleshooting and moved the usb to multiple ports on the laptop nothing worked guessing just received dud or maybe the mouse just isn compatible with my laptop ve used multiple wireless mouses with this laptop this is the first time ve ever had an issue make sure you try the mouse out right away after charging upon receiving it incase it doesn work and needs to be returned 
0,i bought this because it looked small and exactly what was looking for when received it turned it on and it lit up got excited to only put it to charge and it completely stopped lighting up tried everything to no avail it either fried during charging or just quit working either way returned it and got my money back 
1,there isn whole lot not to like about this product the sound quality is impressive to say the least have yet to find circumstance where it is necessary to even hit half volume haha the bass is damn near as nice as the speakers in my car which guess isn saying much just have an set up the battery life is another very impressive part of this buy play my speaker probably good hrs day and generally don have to charge it until the third day of doing this have yet to play with eq functions on the app as out of the box the audio balance was pretty on point all in all can say am extremely pleased with the product 
1,it great as am able to hear my buddies and don have to hear my sisters talking mostly to play on my ps 
1,i love it portability it loud in proximity but not too obnoxiously loud to disturb neighbors when use it in my open garage it connects quickly and it easy to pair battery life lasts much longer than jbl flip lastly purchasing strap accessory is good investment so you can carry it around 
0,speakers have trouble connecting to bluetooth tried resetting and still get distorted sound when connecting to stereo mode thru the jbl app the sound is good and am sure the battery life is fantastic possible got bad set box appeared to have been previously opened sending back and getting replacement 
0,i initially liked this mouse but after month it stopped working terrible product waste of money
0,this mouse is so sensitive if the surface is not absolutely debris free or flat signal signal won be sent from the wireless mouse to the computer screen ve had it for several weeks and have tried it with several mouse pads surfaces paper under the mouse it just not good fit like the changing light color it very pretty but for me not great wireless mouse 
1,great product mouse is exactly as advertised on the site highly recommended 
1,we use it for rosetta stone it works really well it is comfortable it looks cool we like it 
0,awsome headset
0,cable quit charging mouse after one charge 
1,i liked that it had mic for gaming and the sound quality was superb 
0,fits my head without giving me headache cancels noise good range of volume long cord 
1,excellent sound and reception 
0,i coming from pair of hyperx cloud headset they recently stopped working so just bought this as cheap replacement and boy was surprised the sound mic quality is just as good as my old hyperx headset don waste your money on expensive headsets this is def worth the price
0,all of my kids got these for their various electronics and no complaints great price nice design 
1,awesome gear 
0,really like array of colors so purchased mouse for every day workflow not gaming the scroll wheel is bit squeaky that the only flaw not sure if will keep it or put in file

1,good quality and nice sound
1,i love it drounds out my neighbors yelling at me
1,i glad found this light up wireless keyboard for my home office had to get used to typing on it but it works and looks great 
0,have no problems works just fine 
1, its really great don use it for gaming if you are looking for that review stop here but for other review keeping reading it changes color on its own you can personally change it that bummer it slowly changes color one thing that bothers me is the default red light when you move it the red light appears and it over powers the other changing colors if your fine with the red light then buy it other than that it does its job really pretty too the mouse is matte black so its not shiny just wanted to mention that 
1,standard wireless mouse works well what really like about it is the colored light at the sides 
0,just received this yesterday and plugged it in today have left it on the charger for longer than hours because every time it says it is charged can not use it longer than min before it goes dead like the look and feel of it but did not buy it to used plugged in very disappointed and will have to buy something different the box got thrown away so guess it can not be returned at this point will give it one more day to try before choosing something different like to hope that just got lemon 
1,this speaker has incredible sounds great value 
0,the mouse stopped working after week of purchase it did not respond to any movement cannot recommend it to someone else cheap product
0,when this gets low on battery it starts to flicker out where the mouse will stop and start sending information so your clicks won register and the mouse will stop moving across the screen the added problem is that it gets to this low battery point after about min to an hour of use and then it acts like that for the next several hours it nearly impossible to keep it charged up that long it shame because love how stylized it is but it basically unusable 
1,good all around sound quality could be better 
0,the wheel button feels like it requires the force to activate and makes the noise of the other buttons whoever approved this should be fired straight into the sun the wheel button gets more use in cad software than any other button and not even minutes of use and the wrist is already strained to the point where can not continue to work 
1,this was great mouse for schoolwork and better then using battery mouse
1,great product very competitive price 
1,the jbl is awesome it has crisp sound and it waterproof it great summer speaker we love our jbl
0,this product only lasted days thought it was not charged but it not that
1,it perfect for my office used since we are still working remotely really nice product for the price 
0,i ve had the jbl for year now and it messed up on me haven damaged it in any way and it has difficulty turning off and on don recommend this speaker 
0,i was enjoying these headphones although they had some odd features like the dual cable that is excessively long the sound quality was pretty great for the price while it lasted but they made odd cracks and pops from time to time maybe from whatever issue caused them to stop working either way am not impressed and even if were to get another pair of headphones from this brand would not try anymore at this price point 
1,great product
1,was so excited for this mouse loved the style and lights when ordered it once received it used it for approx half day and then it died and never turned back on charged it through the pc for quite while when realized it hadnt charged tried wall outlet never turned back on went through some of the reviews after and realized it was running theme and that many other customers had the same experience dont waste your time 
1,great deal for the price and absolutely love the color 
1,this mouse works very well holds good charge and is easy to connect and transport as travel quite bit 
1,best bang for your buck literally
1,this is very nice mouse for the price the charge in the battery lasts long time and the mouse buttons make almost no noise whatsoever perfect for use during lecture at school when you don want to disturb the speaker with incessant clicking noises not sure how this would be for gamers but the switchable dpi is very nice feature as well also do feel that should point out that the rgb lights are switchable on and off which is nice feature if you are like me and are in class where the room goes dark for presentations and video clips 
1,i absolutely love this mouse it well built and has so many features that similarly priced mice don have it so whisper quiet and smooth as can be it also rechargable which helps out ton 
1,the mouse is very pretty and lights up pretty silent when in use its small in size
1,love it really fast shipping didn even expect to come today
0,end up returning it within weeks of purchase this is light not in good way weight feels like its cheaply made my clicks and moves were not in sync when clicked the mouse to my new surface laptop 
0,center wheel was hard to roll after couple of days few days later the whole thing failed like the rechargeable feature but battery does not last long
0,full charge lasts two hours or less if you want to use it all day you have to charge it three to five times and of course can use it while it charging buying different wireless mouse today 
1, great mouse fits my hand easy to use
0,i been using the speaker for while and haven even charged it yet 
1,lasts long on initial charge perfect size 
1,i bought this for my work laptop and really like it the coloring changing option is fun but don turn that on very often so the charge lasts longer have small hands and it fits my hand comfortably 
1,the color wasn like the photo it bit darker than what was expecting see photo for reference did love that the mouse came with usb to usb adapter the part that connects to the computer for wireless capabilities was stuck so had to use excessive force to remove it only other thing could change is the led colors it goes through series of colors but it would be fun to be able to choose what color it could be 
1,if you are looking for mouse that is small and slim pretty color and one that lights up this one does all of that and it is quiet while the little booklet is in foreign languagei am satisfied with my purchase and even though the seller offered no refund is necessary 
1,i love the noise cancellation and quality of the head phones 
1,the led lights are nice have tried it out it good keyboard no problems yet

1,really cool looking headset great quality sound too definitely worth my money 
1,loud portable speaker that is very easy to link up to another jbl speaker for music playing in areas 
0,the scroller doesn work mouse feels generic
1,the mouse doesn work the reason they have good ratings is because they ask you to rate star and promise refund don buy 
1,i really love this mouse bought it for my office to get rid of the cords the colors are nice and like that it goes to sleep when not in use ve gotten many compliments on it 
1,my grandson had trouble with his wireless keyboard which was christmas gift he told me of the trouble and said would contact klim customer service suspected it was dongle problem and emailed them and got response back in hours from service rep named lolita she instructed me what to do to identify my amazon order number and emailed it back to her hours later got response with instructions on trouble shooting the problem it did in fact turn out to be the dongle emailed back our findings and almost immediately got response from lolita that she was shipping complete new keyboard and dongle her reason was in case it wasn the dongle she did not want to disappoint my grandson by having to wait for additional resolution days later received the new keyboard and all is well believe the customer service is in the uk considering the time difference found this to be amazing service thank you lolita their products are great but their service was unbelievable 
1,great comfort and fit 
0,i had to update my review because initially gave it only one star it abruptly stopped working after months but realized the following day that it was actually problem with my mac or wifi instead of the mouse when attempted to print my mac was also not finding my printer ooops so shut down my mac my printer my wifi and when turned everything back on all was well not sure which thing caused the problem but happily my mouse is working fine again no one contacted me to change my review was not offered anything as business owner understand how important reviews are so when something turns out differently we need to update our review it the right thing to do 
1,was able to connect the dual cables to the back of my pc with ease great for playing online and chatting with others 
0,i rarely ever give poor review on anything but am very disappointed in this product the internal battery will not take charge have tried other cables and charging boxes for the price paid for this we should expect that it last for years not months purchased the speaker on may and its now sept 
1,purchased this for our laptop daughter loves it colors are great works good
1,my bf loves it love that you can use it as charger when out and about the sound qaulity is amazing would recommend 
1,decent if you like simple mouse cool lights as well 
0,headset randomly stopped working one day was in the middle of game and all of my audio got cut nothing could do to fix it cheap quality headset do not buy 
1,buy it and love it you won regret it 
1,that was my first review but the mouse did not work the seller replaced it immediately and that one works fine again be aware that this is rechargeable mouse and you cannot replace the batteriesthe seller should ve been clearer that this is recharging mouse and don know how you replace the rechargeable batteries so that the only complaintotherwise it great mouse
0,because the keylighting was not distinctive enough and because the time out was too fast for our preference it did not meet our needs 
0,while typing high pitch humming comes from the charging port area that only goes away when the keyboard goes to sleep other than that the keyboard spacebar after long extensive typing starts to wear off and the spring becomes more audible 
1,great they have crisp and clear sound but for stereo sound you should have two 
1,i loved this mouse it was so pretty and the glided really smoothly everything worked great for about month and now the mouse won turn on ve charged it fully and whenever attempt to turn the switch on it shuts right back off that being said did buy another one being under don mind having to replace it hopefully it was fluke with the first mouse and this second one will work for much longer than few weeks if the same thing happens again will not be purchasing third 
0,i like the size and the fact don have to change betteries
0,i can mention why or amazon little gatekeepers won let my review post but can tell you that this was bad purchase would not recommend it and that you should buy something else somewhere else quality sound etc were bad everything was bad 
1,this is replacement from an older style love it 
1,love it came several days early and am so pleased my only grievance is that it didn come with charger box 
1,really like the feel of them and they look amazing bt can glow with usb plug in unless sit directly in front of your game system
1,great
1,i have owned this speaker for year now and still love it pros great volume and sound some of the best bass have experienced from bluetooth portable speaker very durable forgot the speaker on the top of my car at one point and this device finally fell off at around mph onto blacktop and bounced down the road thought had just completely ruined my jbl but other than some superficial scuffing nothing was damaged have used the speaker to play music in the rain and there were no issues the battery typically lasts over hours with easecons the volume tends to be to loud the volume makes big jumps when clicked so occasionally just can hit that sweet spot it also doesn go low enough for quiet study music at least for me 
1,the noise cancellation is great sound quality is very loud overall this is great product 
0,not so comfortable on hand comparing to microsoft mouse and the refresh rate seems inferior the only superiority is it design for home purposes it is ok it have very quit click
1,great sound portability and battery life 
0,the first few weeks it worked great then all of sudden the scroll stopped working and it just spins have to physically grab the side of the page to move down really disappointed

0,i ve learned this lesson again open the package and use the product right away ordered this mouse in august as my travel mouse and just packed it away in my bag now ve been visiting family in the pnw since mid september the mouse took charge and worked fine for couple of weeks after recharged the mouse it worked for day or two and then ceased to function the optical light will flash once when turned on then nothing of course the return window is well past 
1,love this product works great for work it is nice it rechargeable and the charge lasts while 
1,after year of using these headphones am finally going to get rid of these that not to say it bad it just not for me after year these still work great even though they ve fallen too many times to count the audio is fine but everything else is lacking straight out of the box the microphone levels were too low so had to already go to my sound panel and microphone boost it to db could hear my voice nice and clear but it picked up just about everything else in my room not to mention that it also picked up the sounds from the speakers inside the earcups made it impossible for me to play in voice chat with friends because you would hear double the audio now onto the build quality of the headset you get what you pay for am pretty small person kinda sad and this headphone was still too small for me it hurt my ears and the sides of my heads for dollars it decent set of headphones but recommend you buy something better

0,worked great for about month and then the button stopped clicking properly or at all 
1,easy to setupvery good sound
1,was perfect for my gaming needs
0,welll it gonna be no from me it not very loud at all it was kind of disappointment compared to other cheaper bluetooth speakers had battery life it lasted maybe hours on full battery charge which is also disappointment as far as bluetooth connectivity had no issues connecting it to my phone which guess is the only good thing can say about it it definitely would not recommend just my two cents 
1,i must say at first wasn to sure about the headset but after using them must say they are fantastic if you want some good headphones for gaming give these try
0,it is hard to use and the sensation is not good 
0,not good at all
1,i love the rotating colors on the mouse but it doesn run by batteries this seems pretty cool at first because you save money on having to buy double but then you have to think about remembering to charge it if you ve been using it all day non stop it starts to die by the night time other than that think it super cute and it pretty good and accurate with pointing even on shiny surfaces didn have much of an issue 
1,it works well lights up very pretty rechargeable very quiet
0,this mouse died months after got it and it spent most of it time turned off inside laptop bag 
1,i like the look and design of the product love it sounds great
1,i just used this mouse for work few hours day and it inexplicably stopped turning on when flipped the switch after just days plugged it in to charge like done few times before and the blue light came on when the blue light went off unplugged it and switched it on but it flashed red couple of times and wouldn work repeated the process with the same outcome know it cheap mouse but wow got less than one day of use for every dollar spent 
1,the mouse drags after use for like an hour battery does not last too long it takes longer to charge then the amount of time been use will not buy look for better quality name brand do not recomend at all wish can get my money back
0,i purchased two of these one was refurbished and the other brand new surprisingly the refurbished one works flawlessly but the new one has many issues you have to twist around the aux plug in and it cuts out until you twist it again the mic cuts out as well some cracklings sounds wouldn purchase again only due to the unreliability 
1,bought these to use them while playing cod warzone sound quality isn good enough couldn hear footsteps in the game clearly 
0,i just am having trouble hooking it up to my xbox controller
1,very beautiful and easy to use but came apart after few months of using
0,i bought months ago and it stopped working it cheap suggest not buying this 
1,these are comfortable headphones wear them even with no music on when there noisy distractions outside they re also great for phone calls 
1,love how loud it gets 
1,i really liked this mouse when first got it it was low profile had nice soft and quiet click had rainbow lights and was available in rose gold color thought made great purchase now ve had it for less than months and the scroll wheel is so squeaky can stand to hear it when scrolling through documents bummed it was lemon 
0,so disappointed this promised to be cute and functional mouse but it never worked not even for day charged it followed all directions am tech proficient and it wouldn even turn on feels cheap too so not surprised so disappointing to purchase things that don work all too common anymore 
1,easy to use and the sound is magnificent easy to take anywhere easy to use
0,if not right hand suggest don buy it
0,i really like the feel and look of this mouse love the matte feel and the lights its also very quiet and not clicky wasn expecting that for the price the only issue have is that if you use it with laptop and remove the receiver often the receiver will come apart im not techy enough to figure out how to make it stay together with glue idk whenever take it out the usb drive and the black part separate and its hard to take the drive out of my computer when that happens frustrating will say that it lasted couple months before that happened though if you use it with pc and never remove it itll last longer just wish could get replacement receiver don want to throw the mouse away if the receiver is the only issue with it got it in february and noticed that it glitches bit if its not on mouse pad or about to die which can be annoying but manageable the mouse charges very quickly 
1,i was looking for wireless rechargeable mouse because recently lost my old mouse but kind of glad did because really love this one it super cute sleek and the lights are so pretty the clicks are quiet like it says in the description and easy to use would recommend this to anyone looking for mouse 
0,i bought this specifically because it said it was quiet keyboard not even close it is no more quiet than normal keyboard false advertising and false description of the product have quiet hp keyboard and thought this one would be like that one because of the description this one went back in the box and ordered another hp wireless elite keyboard wish had just ordered another hp in the first place but got fooled by the false description in the headline of this keyboard 
1,i needed mouse that was reliable and easy to use this was perfect wireless and just plug in and use love the different colors don think twice get this mouse asap 
0,very cool lighting as seen in the photos and it soft touch mouse no loud clicks here 
1,works well and really pretty
1,perfect mouse for my laptop thin and easily stored it tracks great and fits into my hands very comfortably sleep mode prevents battery drainage if forget to turn it off after use highly recommend 
1,i love this mouse got the pink gold rose one it first of all so elegant and the best part is that it mute the clicks are soft and smooth 
1,i was used to buying name brand mouses and was worried about the size of this device but actually its good size just with lower profile works very well and sleeps and wakes up when you push the button on top the lighting is nice not real bright but just strip around the outside and the button lights up changes color which is nice touch so actually like it better than the other larger mouses have 
0,mouse not working properly 
0,this is the second time ve replaced this mouse and after being fully charged the power doesn come on will never buy again the product support is nonexistent 
0,the mouse look and feel is nice and sleek but it does not slide well due to the bottom strips coming off and restricting the movement unfortunately has to go back the seller keeps contacting me offering money to remove the review 
0,on off switch too small like the way it lights up was always leaving the old mouse on add written review
1,there not the best but if your paying this amount of money say they are great definitely worth it
1,hopefully mine was the outlier because mine was bricked on arrival power button only lit up while plugged in and even then none of the buttons would function and the unit would not play music even when showing full battery have flip already which love and am highly disappointed had to get refund expected better from jbl
1,perfect speaker

1,sounds quality is amazing battery last very long and the overall built quality is just good never ever reviewed something and gave it five star but this one absolutely deserves it 
1,just adquiere this speaker and really amazed by the sound quality and volume of this small device an enthusiast of sound and music and have years of experience listening and installing different sound sources either car audio and home can say that for sure that bigger equipment sound better but for the size of this can be more happy good bass reproduction 
1,my son loves this he uses it for school since he does virtual school and for his game and it works really good the other brands we had before broke fast and didn work well 
1,jbl bluetooth wireless speakers are by far the best purchase you can make if you are looking for something with long battery life and awesome sound quality own of these and use them both daily 
1,i bought this mouse specifically for its price and slim profile wanted something small and compact that is easy to pack in my laptop bag this fits the bill this mouse is perfect for everyday use such as going to websites using office applications like word excel and powerpoint etci would not recommend the mouse for gaming purposes and that is not what it is meant for anyway if you want mouse that works for web browsing office work on the go looks nice and is slim and compact get this device 
0,didn work very well from the very beginning then it was dropped in water dried out and was even worse 
0,lightweight easy bluetooth connection the glow adds an extra pizzazz 
0,after having this mouse for weeks it stopped working computer doesn recognize the usb and wont pair with it wirelessly this is the replacement for the original one that broke after being dropped short distance no way of contacting the seller very disappointed

0,excelente bocina
0,this headset is good if you want them for gaming 
0,mic did not work
1,update had it charging for less than minute and the whole house smelled like burning plastic in that time the cord got super hot and the part where it plugged into the mouse was super hot as well probably would have caught fire if left unattended update using different cords was just fine do not use the cord that comes with it update battery won hold charge was really wanting this mouse to work but looks like returning it after all 
1,easily hooked up to my laptop and works like charm 
1,i love the option to turn off the lights it is nice that its rechargeable and can be used while charging if needed the color got was mint color do not recall what it was listed as it is fun color and the light on the mouse are an added bonus 
0,i can hear everything even when my game is on loud do not buy for noise cancelling rated stars for false advertising
0,i have had of these the first mouse ordered worked fine until the mouse just felt loose and didn respond was able to get replacement and was satisfied the replacement did the same thing got it in jan and today the scroll wheel just felt loose and didn respond waste of money do not recommend 
0,it is handy keyboard
1,like the size and ease of using it to travel with took it to broken bow and it worked great on the outdoor patio sound does break up some the more bass you have it really depends on what room you are in for the sound of this thing some environments are better then other easy connectivity and we have enjoyed it would recommend it 
0,it nice product for watching movies 
1,works good my son loves it
0,disappointed with this product stops tracking after few seconds of usage regardless of how have it charged faulty product 
1,excellent sound it has tons of bass which was looking for 
1,just hit but it is cheaply made should hv purchased from best buy vs this one 
0,this is really nice mouse like it and it works well the only thing is you charge it with mini usb charger and it takes long time not sure if not charging it all the way but it has short battery life 
1,this was gift for my son in law he loves it and uses it throughout the house 
0,i haven used this product for at least day and it is already not working it doesn track properly to my computer this is the worst mouse save your money and don buy this
1,i like the head phones the sound is good 
1,straight out of the box it is sleek and feels good in my hand however it does not read on or off the mousepad very disappointed 
1,a little quiet for my intended use high noise environment but great sound for the price portable and durable battery doesn last super long when at full volume but can run off the cord 
1,overall really like them they re fairly solid product comfortable to wear sound quality it good they feel sturdy and easy to operate the only complaint have is that the cord is little bulky and cumbersome but even with that actually kind of glad that its sturdy and feels durable 
1,really nice mouse smooth responsive the clicks are pretty noiseless this is my first wireless rgb mouse get so far not disappointed you can also use it while connected to the charging cable 
1,this is awesome didn know it lit up different colors was just in hurry online shopping glad got this works great
0,cute mouse but that about it very flimsy and poor quality feeling like that it rechargeable ve had this for few months now and it stopped working it charged clean clear of debris and on mousepad but still doesn work for more than few seconds waste of money 
1,i got this for my mother because she wanted something pink and cheap it really feels like its made of trash it does seem to work well enough though the tracking is inconsistent at best the ergonomics are really non existent doesn seem like it made for human hands overall if you re buying for somebody who wants something cheap and pink and cant tell the difference go for it but if you actually care about having half decent mouse skip this one 
0,nice simple headset for gaming inexpensive with year warranty 
0,this is cheap product don buy it
0,this mouse has wonderful feel to it and the lights are pretty however the first one broke not even five minutes into using it it stopped being able to click second one lasted one day the quit tracking pieces of junk am returning both 
1,i bought the charge year after got the charge loved the thumpin bass on the charge and decided to pair it with another jbl product and decided to go with the upgrade so got the charge set it up to the right and left of my work area the whole set up sounded awesome with sound coming from both left and right speaker sources as awesome as it was though it was not stereo just two identical sounds coming from different sources can hear the sound engineer instrumental separations during the recording as with headphones but like said produced some pretty good results for the price 
0,so far have been loving this keyboard have not had any drop outs on the wireless would recommend for anyone causal but serious gamers know to always go wired 
1,this product was definitely worth the money it equipped with every function desirable for wireless mouse being rechargeable is alot better compared to constantly switching batteries personally the rgb lights were nice as well 
1,good portable speaker the only thing and imagine it happens to all portables the load is directly proportional to the level of volume you use if you use it low average lasts three days or more if you use it at full power three or four hours at most in general good sound and meets what is offered 
0,very quite no clicking noise and it stays lit up all day 
1,on the outside this headset looks great and fits comfortably not sure if mine is defective or just had something come loose in shipping but it doesn quite work right the microphone works fine and the left earpiece works fine the rights side is where the problem is have to move the cord just right to hear out of it if this was headset say it fine but for feel like should at least be able to hear out of both sides without having to do yoga position to get it to work properly overall say it not bad but also not great do with that what you will 
1,very easy to use and sleek design it is small enough to fit easily into my computer bag when have to take it with me 
1,i use this exclusively for my raspberry pis and it works great love that the dongle sits under the mouse itself makes it easy to bring with me everywhere 
0,after day or the mouse would not work at all it was not problem with the connection my computer was able to pick up the bluetooth no problem the mouse itself would not work unless it was plugged into some sort of charger kind of defeats the purpose of wireless mouse 
1,i absolutely love how vibrant the lights are and how light weight the mouse is work from home and use this alot 
0,usb adaptor is not working but that why bought this mouse 
0,didn last worked for short while guess you get what you pay for 
0,battery won hold charge the first one failed within days and was replaced the second one failed one week after days and out of the support period 
0,i an oontz angle guy these jbl have way to much bass don know how this is star product they may be deaf or hard at hearing it just straight bass 
1,excellent speaker
0,did not work with my older dell computer
0,the mouse never worked am very disappointed 
1,excellent audio and performance as well no problems at the start and so far still no problems friends say audio comes out clear so great for chatting with online friends with ease 
0,stopped charging after months poor quality 
1,great quality headset and sound lights are bright my boys age and years old likes it
0,this product worked only for the first time have charged it and then could not hold any charge have kept it plugged for whole day without success do not waste your money get decent product from decent manufacturer 
1,i love this mouse the slim designer color and quick easy to charge
1,update days later and the receiver has started to experience an internal fault it is loosing connection with my pc and acting as if removed the receiver from the usb port windows is even playing disconnected chime moving to new port does not fix the problem it uses windows drivers so there no update it seems to have started about week after the last version update am running windows version maybe it needs firmware update also if you go to the website listed for support in the us they don have any electronics on the site only outdoor gear confusing plus it not support they are only open mst pros will start by saying that appreciate that the charging port is type that makes it easier to charge given that most pc electronics are going that way the battery lasts about week between charges for me with about hours of use per day it also lot more responsive than my old wireless logi ch keyboard like noticed difference in rocket league immediately backlight is ok have it set to solid and med bright cons it not true rgb backlight there are only options for color on the lighting wave or solid on it just different color leds in the backlight the keyboard layout is also different from my old keyboard the enter key is tall instead of double key width so when type end up hitting the key instead of enter and when you re in game short on time you don need missed keys if you want an rgb keyboard this is not the one you want if you want responsive wireless keyboard with multicolor backlight this might be the one for you 
1,this product wasn terrible as it had good sound quality but the fact of the matter is got it last august and all of sudden it just stopped working while in an xbox party with my friends had headset before this that stopped working but it lasted more than years this headset not even lasting months is an embarrassment and wish bought another headset
0,very good
1,i am by no means headset snob have some specifications that want met for gaming headset these headphones check lot of boxes but not all of them unfortunately will be looking for new headset because the microphone is pretty muffled am in party chat days week my friends have stated that the mic is muffled and kind of muddy louder sounds make their way through the mic for example gunshots loud animal calls in hunting game loud screams effects from scary game etc the mic is fixed this is obvious with the photos but didn realize how much it would effect me can adjust how close or far the mic is from my mouth and therefore can really try to fix mic quality the plastic quality is ehh it feels little cheaper but you get what you re paying for with budget headset the bass was not all that impressive have had lot worse but also much better as well say it bass rating and this is one of the most important features for me everything else about the headset is great but don recommend it for gaming with friends their best features include long braided cord crisp loud and powerful sound comfortable and light with great quality earmuffs great designcons fixed mic bad mic quality not best for really small losing sound quality or really large losing comfort head lacking amazing bass
0,very disappointed recevied this item december th unoxed it on december th today is jan th and the mouse stop working 
1,and for the prices probably the best buy have ever gotten for gaming headphones these fit an adult head and kid says they are comfortable sound is good too 
0,the mouse has good shape and charges quickly but the roll just broke after one week of use
1,amazing product able to take it where ever and connect when needed nice and small fits any where need for on the go 
0,this is good looking keyboard the rainbow colors you see are all you can get so no selection of one color is available although the brightness settings are adjustable which is nice not critical issue as said it nice looking keyboard but functionally there are couple of issues that are immediately apparent first the enter key as in the picture attached has notch in it that is shared with the key am constantly hitting the and enter resulting in failed passwords and clutters chat messages so at minimum it will take some time to get used to this and hit the enter key alone another issue seems to be battery life instructions indicate hours to charge can accept that what can accept is the life of the battery after in the short time have had this keyboard it has died on my twice within day of getting full charge so sleep function is either broken or poorly designed with regard to maintaining battery life so now am keeping it wired with the provided cable because cannot be without keyboard when it dies and plugging it into power source is not enough once the battery is dead it will not power up until it has gotten enough of charge to respond but connected to the pc via usb cable makes it online instantly overall poor technical design my only other complaint and it could just be me adapting from laptop keyboards to mechanical desktop keyboard again but typing on this keyboard continues to feel clumsy but while writing this review took moment to look closer the keys on this keyboard are probably good smaller surface area than either laptop typically use this adds to the closeness of the keys and why am constantly off key here and there typing as normally do by feel alone square key up from the base versus the pyramidal shape of these keys would make them bigger and more tolerable this is what may ultimately force me to try another keyboard and send this one back 
1,it got delivered month ago and it has stopped working after using for like the th time it turns on them off immediately it got charge and just won work glad got my invoice since can still write it off as business expense not good product and will not buy again not very pleased with this device 
0,this is the second time purchase this mouse in matter of few months and the second one is already not working at all charged it and all and nothing have the rose gold one can you guys please send new one or refund me like the color matches my laptop well but refuse to keep re purchasing every other few months 
0,udpate you can use control shift together on the left side of the keyboard quick tab opens window movement what an abusrd error do yourself favor and buy different keyboard this keyboard hits all the nails except for the spacebar it seems to be made of an entirely different plastic than the rest of the keyboard and is distractingly loud if you re working in an office environment it likely you ll get looks from your co workers it ruins the entire keyboard experience 
0,the rest of the mouse is fine but the scroll wheel no longer scrolls took just over month for it to break so can even return it now 
1,i love my new mouse really like the low profile and the colorful lights it was totally plug and play with no problem very pleased with my purchase 
1,this was the perfect gift for my son he loves it the blue lights are plus 
1,perfect
1,skip past every comment besides this one best headset ever quality lmfao you see the taped cig box on the mic that the only way people can hear you threw the headset only figured this out cause was joking around about the pos with my fiancee and cuffed my hand around my mouth and the mic and it worked well cig pack is almost the right size but still works have to funnel all noise to it noise cancelation golden even the gamers voice is cancelled out unless you do this
0,terrible it didn work out the box bad product smh
1,i love this so much so happy with this that order two

0,satisfied have two and use the connect plus 
1,sounds great easy to connect 
0, new keyboard came with seal broken and dongle missing rendering this keyboard all but useless looks like it might have been decent product but not really confident in this distributor

1,very nice bought love it 
0,this mouse is rechargeable which is great except that it doesn hold charge charged it all night and the next day it died after using it for minutes would not recommend this item and will go back to wireless mouse that uses batteries 
1,quality is great 
1,this is an awesome little mouse connection was super easy it quiet as mouse and compared to my last mouse silent the buttons work great it feels really smooth and think the size is perfect for me 
1,love it came with the mouse itself white cable black usbc adapter the white little adapter underneath the mouse easily connected to the black usb that used for my macbook to usbc the white small cable believe to charge it you can easily turn off the lights but they look really nice on mouse is thin but comfortable although order the silver to match my laptop it is not the exact same but close just bit darker 
1, so far so good does what it supposed to do worked right out of the box like that don have to buy batteries for it it charges quickly lasts looking time and is compatible with my hp chromebook it has two settings solid red color only when mouse is moving and slow changing rainbow when mouse is moving and or at rest the usb tucks away into the bottom of the mouse which is where you ll find it when you open the box for the first time also comes with an adapter and short charging cable 
0,i actually really love this mouse its slim and quiet the multicolored led lights stopped working after days but it does not affect the quality of it just bummer they dont work anymore 
0,i use this to keep out the noise that goes on in my house live with kids so it can get quite noisy around me and these do good job with keeping the noise out 
0,this item sounds great and looks great but it doesn stay charged so that makes it useless or decorative paperweight 
0,does not work at all lights come on but it doesn connect to dongle and does nothing 
0,not worth the value
1,sounds great for the form factor takes aux in for the odd ball things that may not support bluetooth ie nintendo switch wish it had fast charging capabilities but legacy usb charging with plenty of power ontap is good enough 
0,received as gift and wanted to love it but the hot keys issue is real the ctrl and shift keys on the left side cannot be used together as programmer can live without hot keys like this select text to end or beginning of documents uppercase or lowercase words etc many editors use these hot keys 
0,ok
1,really disappointed wanted to love this product but the usb adapter that came with it doesn fit into my usb port it looks like it only goes half way in so basically the product is useless the mouse itself was pretty and easy to manipulate wish the adapter worked
0,lights only work when connected to usb
1,i had ordered these to replace my headset that went out and will admit these worked amazingly as console gamer it was tad frustrating that the cable split isnt longer but to be honest it doesnt even bother me now use it for when streaming on my pc and it perfect for it the mic quality is better than expected and the lights look really nice also you really cant beat the price 
0,never lit up my autistic son wanted these so bad for that reason and of course they didn work

1,if you just need wireless keyboard it is as decent as any other no complaints in terms of typing the back lit function however is very weak the brightest setting really does not brighten the key lettering so you can see in darkened room what you re typing the backlit is just very nice looking dressing that brightens under the keys and constantly shuts off so you have to click something then undo before can type with the fancy light on practical level the back light is really useless just nice to look at nothing more
0,i work from home and have to run more than one screen and this mouse was amazing when bought it now it has decided that it doesn want to charge and is currently useless after only week was about to buy another one for my mom but have canceled it now since this one has stopped working it sucks because it such fun mouse it also never leaves my home office so know it not from packing or moving it around lot
0,i love the way the mouse looks and feels but oh the mistakes make this mouse has mind of it own and jumps all over the place have accidentally closed files programs while working on them move public folder and having to contact it to move back and many more random errors as result of this erratic mouse sometimes while not even using the mouse can see the curser go on walkabout all over my screen perhaps there is ghost in the machine but if so they are hostile will be replacing it asap 
1,i had flip this is flip on steroids great base for relatively small speaker
0,i never write reviews as matter of fact this is the first have ever written but due to the danger factor felt compelled to my son plugged in his mouse this morning and walked away and within minute my husband smelled something burning and fortunately was able to get to it before the flames yes flames reached the drapes because the charging cable caught on fire

0,i really like the feel and look of this mouse don like that anytime stop using the mouse for minute or two that the mouse doesn react end up turning it off and on again to get it working interrupted frequently while using the mouse so it not realistic for me to turn the mouse off every time stop using it edit today is day of using the mouse while wait to receive the other mouse bought the mouse no longer consistently turns on when turn it off and on again to stop it from lagging

1,love love love this thing even at low volumes it has full range of sound own an older bose sound link mini whose sound it also superb but this charge has far louder range bought it for around the home use and our annual trips to the philippines where things tend to get wet on the beach being quite waterproof that shouldn be an issue with the charge the bluetooth connects easily and quickly no toggling on and off to get it to work as with some older bluetooth speakers haven used it long enough but the battery shouldn be any sort of problem at all since it mah which means it allowed on planes overall extremely pleased 
1,super comfortable to use 
0,this mouse was certifiable piece of crap worked until the initial charge was drained and never again do not buy this hunk of junk 
0,could use an instruction sheet also what is the expected battery life on single charge

1,great birthday gift for my granddaughter
0,update have been sent emails from the seller begging me to change my review of the emails offered me to do so this explains the positive reviews despite the terrible product the mouse freezes constantly left and right click will work but the mouse will not move this is the worst mouse ve ever had it also goes into sleep mode after minutes of not being used which is annoying and no way to turn it off the light also stays on while in sleep mode which doesn make sense the charge doesn last very long at all charging it every couple of days 
0,this is by far my favorite mouse can wake up my computer by tapping the button on the mouse goes to sleep saving me bit in new batteries if didn notice the mouse sliding off the laptop and onto the chair laser up would be changing the batteries frequently this one recharges no batteries to buy 
1,this mouse works excellent it easy to move very lightweight love the way it lights up excellent buy 
1,my son loves them
0,get the next size up sound volume is weak
1, update this mouse is garbage wrote my review after one day of good functionality but the rechargeable battery seems to only last one day before it starts being jerky and responding inconsistently buttons don always work when click something if take out the usb and turn on off the mouse it fixes it for few minutes until it goes into sleep mode the first one they sent me didn work at all and this new one just doesn work it works better if the mouse is plugged in but the cord is short and stiff ordering something else the mouse works great for my dell laptop fits comfortably sleek profile no problems the button is still audible but quieter than my last mouse had an issue with my first shipment but customer service was very responsive problem solved with me and then shipped me new mouse very quickly 
1,i love the sleek design of this mouse my favorite aspect though is the quiet clicking the noise is muted and that is an unexpected bonus 
0,no issues has good battery life looks slick and is really light weight 
1,im very happy with the quality and the design of the keyboard im glad there are many features including wireless and waterproof 
1,kicks ass booming bass best ve ever had as portable water resistant outdoor speaker works great indoors too volume gets loud and not seemingly throttled like other speakers at small distanced campfire among pod sharers we linked speakers and it was incredible the nd and rd speaker occasionally cut for second but came back on in sync too believe it was in relation to distance or blockages from phone to speaker rather than speaker to speaker in other words speakers around the phone can make larger circle opposed to repeating to go one further from the master speaker in line recommend getting case to extend the life of this awesome addition enjoy 
1,works like charm you can change the mouse speed right from the actual device love it 
1,sound is great mic is great everything about these headphones are top notch they even light up and didn know that was so excited when got them in the mail so cute and so high quality

1,i bought this keyboard about months ago and have used it daily for gaming for the most part it awesome it lightweight easy to use the rbg is nice and clear and perfect for night time gaming ve seen some reviews saying the power button is cheap and feels likely to break that is not the cause the power button isn flimsy in the slightest and doesn feel cheap also saw some say there no volume control on the keyboard there is keys for it are on the top left side my only complaint with this keyboard has been the noise lot of people including kilm claim it is silent have not found the that the case it an angry typing sounding keyboard and often have to make sure my mic is muted before using it to save complaints overall it great keyboard especially if you re on budget have no doubts that it will last long time and be worth every penny 
1,used for my grandson ps but audio doesn work his friends can hear him
0,the mouse worked great loved it actually but the charging cord is severed and while it does charge it also will shock you little if you accidentally touch it while plugging into charging port or plugging the mouse in and because the charging cord is only inches hard to refrain from touching where it is severed will stop using this when new different mouse arrives 
0,wire is broken within month contacted seller and got refund immediately now they are changing vendor to get good quality wire 
0,charging indicator light stopped working after only few days so could never tell if its actually charging or not wasn huge deal because at least it still worked but now that it been like months went to plug it in the other night charged it all night and it now wont even hold charge can plug it in for hours turn it on and the lights only stay on for few seconds before the whole unit dies totally not happy that now have to spend another that don have on another keyboard like the saying goes buy it nice or buy it twice

1,i don game that intensely more of hobby to stay in touch with out of town friends this headset was affordable and definitely fits my needs

1,my life has changed the sound quality of this battery is perfect for my space look we would all like perfect sound quality but the truth is so many factors determine sound quality especially the recording itself the jbl offers greatvpower turning down the volume usually helps with balancing the sound when played at higher levels winner

1,great bass and rich and amazing sound
0,i like that it does not need batteries the battery lasts long time 
0,first time charging this mouse started smelling burnt plastic smell in my home walked over to where it was charging and noticed the smell was lot stronger reached down to unplug it and the cord was red hot had not been in that room it would have started fire not happy 
1,took it to work with me few times and had my job feeling like club with how much base it pumps out and the sound is crisp and clean 
1,i like this speaker crisp clear sound with nice bass the only misleading part for me was the hr playtime after hours on moderate volume it was down to the nd to last light and it also says you can have something charging as well thru the usb highly doubt would have lot of battery in doing so nothing different in battery longevity compared to my other non jbl speakers except better sound 
1,the sound quality is ok and by that mean there is some surround sound left right but not so much full directional and that pretty important to know teammates said mic sounded ok downside is the mic is short and stiff maybe that will protect it better the mic is adequate and good for the price now for the meat of this review the ear covers are stiff and tiny they wrap around my year olds ears great not mine though it actually painful to wear these longer than minutes so don plan to game long with these if you have tiny ears or are under years old then these are for you of you re an adult move on ended up spending more for razer kraken headset and omg let me tell you for the price think got the value the sound quality of the razer headset is just miles ahead of these garbage bengoos you try these trashy bengoos and then try some razer krakens with surround and you will blow your mind of the quality difference not just in sound quality but also in build quality the mic the comfort of the ear muffs just wow would have paid the price difference if knew beforehand how big difference there is between trashy cheap bengoos and actual good quality headsets like razer never going back from razer ll buy them again and again for life now that know 
0,order met his expectations
1,my son enjoyed the design 
0,the mouse stopped working after only two months of using it pretty disappointing
1,i don use this for gaming and haven used the sleep mode so can really rate it like the way it lights up and it good keyboard only issue is lost the charging cable and can seem to find replacement not even on their website do recommend this though 
1,my wife and spend lot of time in the outdoors and were looking to upgrade out speaker the most important things that we were looking for were sound quality needed to be waterproof and something that would be durable and last long time this speaker has certainly delivered on all of these things one of the biggest complaints that saw while during research was the mono speaker there are some users out there that severely dislike this design and honestly it almost swayed me away from buying it that said could not be happier with this speaker mono speaker works great produces amazing sound really loud and it truly is water proof trust me we ve tested would definitely buy this speaker again 
1,this mouse is smooth to use and feels great in my hand recommend it 
0,love it iv had it for about months now and can only recall time it went dead it wouldn have went dead if it weren for me neglecting to charge it but it left on for couple days other then that its great mouse use it almost everyday and only find myself charging it about once month 
1,love it
1,i ll be honest at such low price didn have big expectations was ready to try them and send them back if didn like them positives the sound quality is actually really good and it does block out ambient noise they are comfortable don think they are too heavy some of the wireless headphones hurt after awhile one reason choose wired negatives it had volume control and although nice to have it adds weight to the cord so have to make sure put the volume control in my lap or else it pulls on the headphones and it heavy the mic only moves up and down which wish it could move away or towards your mouth too overall for the price these are nice 
1,works great one of the best headsets so far good for gaming 
0,the mouse is not effective charged for hours still no life or function do not buy when noticed that the mouse was not working charged it for hours tried the mouse again and it still did not work but showed red as one of the colors which may be warning the seller did not respond or reply to assist me with any troubleshooting unsatisfied customer

1,an absolutely great choice for office work

0,literally only had the mouse for three days and used it on the first day and now it has stopped working it doesn charge plug it up and it may charge for minutes then it just stops charging then when go to turn it on it just turns on and instantly turns off this mouse is literally piece of crap will be getting my money back 
0,worked fine for month now it doesn hold charge and if wanted it to work need to tape the charger into very specific spot cheaply made piece of crap
0,mouse is nice and lightweight and quiet but its lags and jumps around sometimes
1,works beautifully ve got house of gamers and these are perfect for me 
1,great sound nifty package and joy to play music or an audio book through should have bought one years ago 
0,quality of sound is good however volume level compared to previous model sucks and the bluetooth changed so now the old models can connect to the new models that really dumb to not have back compatible technology my sister has previous model and it fills back yard of several acres can barely hear this across my warehouse would say it to as loud as previous bought it to hear above the refrigerator units and its disappointing for the price oh well guess that the price you pay for buying something online that you can hear the exact unit first 
0,had them for months and loved them after that was having trouble with them connecting to the xbox and after few weeks of that they just died 
1,i was looking for simple inexpensive wireless mouse to use on server that only have to access occasionally this fit the bill perfectly drivers installed automatically from windows and off to the races great price for simple solution

1,i like that they fit around the ear and man they sound amazing 
1,this is the best computer mouse have ever bought like that you just recharge it 
1,this mouse is very sleek and comfortable to use the click is very quiet highly recommend for the price 
0,so frustrating it just responds less and less even immediately after charging for full day so disappointing 
0,my son loves corded headphones and this was really nice one doesn drowned out all noise but does the job for the money
1,this mouse looked promising based on all the positive reviews it is light good to hold and has good battery life it is also quiet with exceptions see below its main problem however is that the middle button the scrollwheel becomes unusable after only short amount of use after which the button needs to be pressed repeatedly in order to register button press also compared to the lmb rmb buttons which are sometimes too light and register button presses accidentally the mmb is extremely rigid in comparison it is also very noisy which is ironic as the other two buttons are completely silent it is much more noisy than other mice have used which is about as someone who relies on this button during daily usage this is very frustrating and frankly serious design flaw like to emphasize that the mouse has been treated well not rough also bought the non led version of this mouse and the exact same problem appeared after the same amount of time another drawback is that the mouse does not indicate when the battery is low leaving one to guess when to recharge it it often becomes erratic mouse pointer moves around and does not register movement well requiring power cycle this is occuring on more than one system all in all decent attempt but quite few issues need to be ironed out doubt the many positive reviews for this product have been based on any more than couple of weeks usage as these issues are consistent and appeared after months frankly expect mouse to last significantly longer and also have useable middle mouse button hope these issues get addressed by the manufacturer 
0,just didn work for me could not plug into my chromebook 
1,i went through headphones before finding these and love them and at this price it steal had hpyerx jbl and runmus these are the best the hyper headset was nice but also twice the cost and the speakers on these are just as good

1,the mouse is ergonomic very easy to use the price is not bad either all in all good purchase 
1,loved this at first however battery is pretty much shot am only using it with home entertainment system computer so it isn getting used lot however in less than months new need to charge it daily or at least every other day not sure the sleep function is working may try turning it off after every use to charge it less often but that will become annoying super fast even if it does work it will likely end up in the trash before long

1,best bluetooth speaker yet
1,just received it and love it already great sounds 
1,i really liked this mouse the design is sleek can use the little attachment for my mac to make it compatible and it maneuvered well however after only few weeks of use the top plastic portion that splits down the middle to accommodate left and right clicking just literally spit apart and now my mouse is not functional very disappointed in the quality and durability of this item however gave it stars for the awesome performance prior to it breaking 
0,fits the hand charge lasts however the cord that comes with it could be more sturdy 
1,love the lights and it comfortable to use 
1, left control does not work in combination with many commands open incognito tab reopen closed tab super annoying wireless connectivity is super questionable even when the dongle less than foot away the enter key is huge not at all comfortable layout

1,i bought this mouse to replace one that had the mousewheel break to be honest loved this mouse at first the lights the feel everything however was not fan of the extra added adapter to make it usb compatible here am months after bought it and the mousewheel no longer functions on this mouse as well for some reason the companies that make these portable mouse mice cannot make one that has sturdy mouse wheel oddly enough the one thing didn like about the mouse originally became my favorite thing now that it is broken the adapter to allow me to run regular usb on usb port

1,good speakers for standard sq feet in room or space don have to charge it often ll say ill still be fine almost up to days because ll only use it for hours wish it came with strap to hold it or speaker case at least for travel worthy small speaker with good sound and base 
1,i have logitech keyboard that use with no problem with my other mouse but when plug this mouse in the keyboard stops working the dongle is also hard to remove from the back of the mouse had to get something small to pry it out little space for your finger to grab it more easily would have been nice 
1,i wasn sure what to expect with this mouse but it works perfectly never thought be so excited to use wireless mouse 
1,i bought this because wanted to get good bluetooth speaker and debated between this and the ue boom because they are about the same price after doing little research figured that the jbl would sound better and surprised the jbl sounds really good good bass at low volumes great mids and highs for portable speaker it does distort slightly when you get bass heavy song using spotify built in eq with bass boost but nothing little eq can solve it turns the bass down when you are close to max volume to protect itself which is nice and it still sounds decent at max volume range is awesome can walk about feet away before it starts cutting out hopefully it lasts will update review if it breaks from normal use or anything like that but so far so good 
1,great mouse especially for the price the led lights are awesome works perfect and easily connects to your device 
1,very comfortable and good audio quality and my friends don complain about how sound anymore

1,i very happy with the keyboard
1,love the sound 
0,sound quality is horrific find speaker like the jbl extreme or that has stereo sound instead god awful even when plugged in with an aux connection instead of bluetooth stay away form this product and heed the warning of the other reviews about this speaker only having mono sound
0,i bought this month ago was working perfectly fine until last week then for no reason it stop working properly it not responsive the cursor move does not match the movements of my hand and can no longer use it just ordered another mouse from other brands
1,bought this led wireless mouse july and received it couple of day later and really loved it well now it aug and as of yesterday it suddenly stopped working correctly don even use it with the fancy light changes on tried charging it couple of times and even once over night and it is still not functioning as it should noticed that if left still for few minutes it would sometimes function well but only for few seconds and then it would begin to sporadically move the cursor if at all the little laser guide light goes dim and blinks quite fast am thinking that it suddenly cannot hold charge oh have also tried using it while connected to the charge port but it does the same would have given it star rating if it continued working properly as really like it however since the sudden misfunction cannot give it more than stars and must say that would not recommend this mouse anymore 
0,works well 
1,absolutely love the sound
0,it works
1,i like that this mouse os sleek in design has long battery life and is easy to set up often forget to turn it off but that doesn matter because it goes into sleep mode to preserve battery the only concern my tablet has type so the converter is helpful the only thing that would change is that the converter doesn fit inside the mouse for storage so you have to be careful not to lose it if you detach it from the tablet 
0,this was really good mouse quiet clicks very lightweight and it moved smoothly over my mouse pad it fell opened up bit was able to put it clip it back in but after the third fall the ball stopped working but for the price it def worth it long battery life think charged like middle of every other week and used it from weekdays for about hours 
1,totally amazing sound battery lasts forever
1,the headset is very comfortable and has amazing noise cancellation 
0,i am big on reviews peoples honest opinions when it counts as for style it nice mouse but for the main purpose of the mouse it is not good even if it completely charged it will only work for about minutes before it starts to freeze then eventually go dead it very frustrating annoying especially if you work from home would of posted pic but am in the process of returning it don feel like getting it 
1,it was very jittery on occasion went to replace it because it was quick buy to get me by until could afford better solution solution it served purpose but wouldn recommend the purchase if you could avoid it 
1,the mouse worked for couple weeks but now the scroller just spins freeling and won scroll one through pages really disappointed because the mouse as whole worked pretty well for the last couple weeks hopefully just defective model will be returning the item and seeking replacement
0,i purchased this wireless mouse the first part of may it is now early july and it doesn work anymore have charged it and it still doesn work waste of money 
1,i love how noise cancelling they are it came with free audio jack which was delighful surprise my friends say they can hear me lot clearer now overall very pleased
0,i read lot of the reviews before decide to buy this item so far have no regrets people complain about the mouse turning off and the lights being on so when got the mouse noticed that there was an off button for the lights if you think about it you are saving power when your not using it would recommend the product 
1,great keyboard am able to connect from another room without direct line of sight response time is excellent it does miss key from time to time but attribute that to range and signal penetration and it really not an imposition but best of all the manufacturer is both very responsive and helpful and also have great sense of humor edit spilled little coffee on it today the keyboard immediately spazzed out turned it off took it apart and cleaned and dried all of it still broken suffice it to say waterproof is not what this is 
1,this mouse is just right to fit my hand light weight pretty lights 
0,it took less than day for the receiver to fall apart in my usb port now the shell is stuck and have to take my computer to get it pulled out 
1,the connection from mouse to laptop isn constant the sleep function is convenient but the mouse doesn have good reaction time had to really press down on the left click for the mouse to do anything 
0,broken out of the box 
1,love this mouse havent had to charge it at all since got it amazing
1, this was pretty good buy and it actually better than thought it pretty quiet when typing and very smooth love how it goes to sleep mode after few seconds the lights on the keyboard are nice and vibrant much better than thought it would be comes with usb to cord for lightning fast charging only charged it once on friday and it still going we ll see how long the keyboard power will last will definitely keep you guys posted other than that no complaints so far 
1,my son needed decent headphones with microphone for virtual distance learning for school he enjoys these they work they are comfortable for his hours of meetings he likes the fact that they light up overall buy again 
1,this was great value and the wireless mouse works well the colors are fun too just wish it had way to keep it on one color 
0,this mouse looks good but that it it works poorly finally gave up and went back to my old wired mouse it just doesn work well you end up wildly moving it around and getting the cursor to where you want it to click on something is struggle would not recommend this mouse 
1,it size is perfect for both travel and for my hands the led is great feature and works just as well as the wired one for my pc even bought my mother one and she loves it too 
1,ergonomics are great quality is okay very lite weight and made of cheap plastic mouse pointer seems jumpy at times for no reason all in all would probably spend little more money if you can or want to so that you get better quality device 
1,i love the color and how slim it is use it for work school 
0,not thrilled with this returned bose bt speaker in exchange for this one bought this because am having hearing issues but sound quality seems bit muddy and fuzzy and didn realize until now that the sound is mono also the bluetooth feature seems unstable in my room where keep the wifi modem and several other bt electronics after some research discovered this speaker won function with too much wifi and bt interference bit frustrating probably going to return it works well in every room in the house except the room where need it the most tired of playing games every night to get bluetooth to work 
0,i have problems with this keyboard just deciding that am not pushing the buttons anymore even when leaving the keyboard connected directly to the computer at times it just stops responding and its incredibly frustrating when trying to game 
0,it took less than day for the receiver to fall apart in my usb port now the shell is stuck and have to take my computer to get it pulled out 
1,ok product for price point wish battery lasted longer the keys are little awkward have to press harder than normal keyboard but for the price happy love it in the dark wish you could change the rainbow effect to solid color but happy overall use it for work so cannot give full review for gaming but did like the fact no software needed to be installed 
0,product never worked defective
1,i use this in class and at home and there is not any noise when you are clicking the buttons which is nice when we are quietly working on things would highly recommend the color changing is also great 
1,it amazing
1,it has great and clear sound with good bass ve never gotten from my other headsets when gaming 
1,i bought these headphones for my year old son who loves video games he loves these headphones and says the sound quality is great he got the blue headphones because they were little cheaper and he liked them 
0,i returned this mouse because am sucker for design even though it only worked for one day and ordered replacement the replacement mouse has lasted weeks with intermittent issues however it no longer charges don waste your time and money
1,works great it little too small and would stress my hand if used it all day everyday but don so keeping it and am content to be more specific the buttons are not directly below my fingertips which would be solved by longer mouse or an ergonomic one that has little more height to it an averaged sized male and to my knowledge my hand is typical of that size of person haha hope this helps 
1,that it doesn light up on both sides of the headphones like thought it would of then that it was great 
0,sound quality is like every headset but the mic js sounds so bad and quiet even if the volume is literally all the way up 
1,it looks feels like top quality product the sound is very good 
0, mouse stopped working had it worked for couple of days 
1,this is great device easy to setup and use right out of the box excellent sound am using it outside as work on big construction project makes the work go much easier 
0,massive waste of money plus the red light was extremely bright and couldn be turned off 
0,rd jbl bluetooth speaker ve owned over the years solid quality and sound battery is good but not going to wow with longevity 
1,i love this mouse it is very lightweight with an attractive look one of my favorite features is that it is rechargeable second you have the option of selecting one color default to red or multiple colors swap automatically the switch is on the bottom portion of the mouse my favorite feature is the fact that the mouse goes into sleep mode when you turn off your computer saved me so many times from having dead mouse it can also be charged while in use overall would definitely recommend this mouse to friends and family 
0,didn even work properly when we opened it 
1,i have bought couple of these speakers they sound great can use the app to use multiple speaker
1, updated review edited the review because the company responded to their marketing promotion after while just gave it to my nephew few days ago and he really likes it bought this headset for my nephew for his gaming purpose did test if it works and am impressed with the quality for this price my gosh and it looks so cool in blue my nephew is gonna love it totally recommend the product 
1,decent product and great value for the price sightly recommend 
1, great mouse the best for the price 
1,gorgeous and very affordable the battery doesn last very long but it easy to charge while using 
1,bought them for the grand kids for christmas they absolutely love them they use them on their phones on the tablets and also gaming me quality is great 
0,works well light weight
0,every time use the mouse there is this high pitched noise hurts my ears
0,it basically junk doesn hold charge it works fine as long as its plugged into the charger but that defies the purpose of wireless mouse
0,cracked really fast illumination isn very bright stand by mode turns off lights very light and slick sometimes hard to hold if you need to move it lights do not flicker just cheap 
0,after month the cord has malfunctioned and sounds is now choppy
1,we got this for my son birthday and it has been great speaker he uses it with his friends all the time on the back of his truck and we have used several times around the pool the speaker is plenty loud enough to hear over the equipment and it has great bass response for such small package the battery seems to stay charged forever and we have not had one single issue with bluetooth connectivity also like the fact that you compare this with other speakers to have true surroundsound when you re out with your buddies or at party 
0,only complaint is usb cord was too short to plug into my computer for the lights on the headphone my laptop had an outlet on the left side and attached cord would not reach 
1,thought was buying the good loud one not as much volume as like on the beach 
1,it cool mouse but don think it worth the price whenever use it my curser ocassionally jerks around the screen and makes it difficult to use it not my computer fault because switched mouses and the other one works fine also the color changing lights are see through from the top got white one and it kind of ruins the feel it just feels really cheap honestly though if it was maybe cheaper and it didn glitch the curser say it worth it like how you can charge it rather than switching out batteries and like how it comes with lightning usb adapter 
1,there nothing dislike about this wireless mouse that use with my laptop computer would recommend this to anyone that would ask me about it 
1,this was an inexpensive headset and it true you get what you paid for guess after two months of my son playing with it at his desk it just stopped working you could tell the materials were cheap by the feel of the headset but expected it to last year or so at least want to add received an mail from this company today they offered me new updated version of this headset if would remove this review some people might do just that and some of you might think it nice thing to do but leave reviews for things like lot or have serious problem and want to make sure their honest reviews based on my experience so refused the off 
1,excellent product very easy to setup and use
0,good sound quality
1,my daughter loves it cute color and works great 
1,we bought three of these for christmas party they can be linked and volume can be controlled individually they sound great and lasted the whole party without having to be charged they are small enough to not be cumbersome but large enough to fill room with sound very impressed for the money 
1,i like that the mouse is slim also like the lights and how smooth it is the sleep mode works fine use the mouse for work am happy with the rechargeable functionality and find don need to recharge daily so far have recharged every few days and don know how long the change will last but at least days for daily work use it is good value in my opinion 
0,just bought it week ago and thus far nothing to complain about my son had had one do quite while and he has had no issues so not anticipating any either 
0,product has ceased working after years it doesn seem to take charge anymore disappointing 
1,i was surprised at the quality of the headset the sound coming from the as well as the microphone are good quality wouldn say they are noise cancelling as could still hear people talking that are sitting next to me but these were not purchased for noise cancelling the sound is very good and they are comfortable didn think they were that heavy for their size 
1,i always loved jbl products they have amazing sound quality for their price point when ordered it was nervous cause always like to test speakers out in store before ordering it but could this time it was gift for my partner and was definitely not disappointed the speaker isn to big and it definitely sounds amazing definitely recommend 
0,the item is supposed to wake up after turning itself off in order to save battery but mine never did had to turn it off and then on again and then after days the cursor began moving wildly by itself and then later that day the buttons stopped working entirely 
1,the mouse is comfortable to move it goes to sleep while in zoom teams call however easily wakes up with one click 
0,good material
0,i needed new mouse for work didn want to deal with batteries and this is exactly what was looking for it light and smooth 
0,the one ordered will only turn on if the switch is in strange position that is between the clicks had to move the switch carefully with two fingers until found the very small area where it turns on sending it back because its almost impossible to use if the switch gets moved it takes few minutes to turn it back on 
0,unfortunately this mouse stopped working after month of use can replace the item or get refund 
1,no problems at all but accidently broke the dongle and they replaced it for free best customer service ever 
0,initially was pleased with the feel and performance of this mouse it is lighter and slimmer than the typical usb wireless mouse and it worked well however after about two weeks the scrolling wheel became erratic and it stopped working altogether today bit more than three weeks in use as result the mouse became essentially useless and am returning it 
1,highly recommend silent click is great you have the option to turn off the color changing mode 
1,i own at top of the line bose bluetooth speaker friend needed recommendation but the bose was twice the price of the jbl imagined the jbl would sound good it jbl after all delivered the jbl charge to my friend last night and we were blown away fabulous sound beautiful design excellent user interface wonderful that it recharged from standard usb power supply completely happy that it doesn come with one who doesn have extras this jbl product is superb 
1,ear pads are very small must be made for little kids ears mic is short but overall sound is good wish it had clip for the controls 
0,if you re programmer or generally use the ctrl shift key combo please skip this the left ctrl shift combination doesn work so you ll have to retrain yourself to use the right only apparently this is known and ongoing issue it not worth the time or effort 
0,they break easily
0,i needed wireless mouse for my new macbook pro that only has usb connections this mouse included an adapter that allowed the standard usb bluetooth receiver to be used in the usb port have only had an opportunity to use it in limited situations thus far but it seems very responsive and performed well the led lights are kinda cool but not really needed trying to see if there is way to use the mouse without the led lights on so can conserve the charge on the battery the only concern issue ve had thus far is that the charging cable connection to the mouse and the adapter don seem to be the most secure and couple times it seemed like the connection came loose and the mouse was no longer charging was still using my laptop while the mouse was charging via the usb port as recommended in the user manual the user manual specifically recommends not using plug in charging adapter like for most cell phones because it might overcharge the mouse and damage it it is recommended that you only use the provided cable and charge it via your laptop to avoid overcharging and damaging the mouse not certain how great an option this is since it seems to come loose and stop charging occasionally if continue to use my laptop while trying to charge the mouse we ll see how it goes in the future if it turns out that it was operator error may update my rating overall though the mouse feels good in my hand and it seems to work well doing everything necessary when need it 
1,works well with something underneath otherwise it seems to wander besides that it feels great 
1,sound is ok lights are cool mic isn very good wouldn purchase again 
0,very cushioning and high qaulity 
1,complete junk never worked don waste your money because it pretty
0,in less than months after purchasing the scrolling wheel stopped working 
0,after only months it will no longer hold charge
1,for someone who listens to bass heavy music this is the perfect speaker can feel the bass with the volume half up 
1,gift for family the love it pool party camping and outdoor fun they love the fact that they can charge their mobile devices from the speakers
0,constantly disconnects from bluetooth sometimes several times in one song 
0,this mouse was awful it worked for few minutes and then stopped working you have to turn it off and back on again for it to work for minute changed the battery twice do not purchase 
0,stopped charging after few months waste 
0,it stopped working after months right in the middle of my shift at work 
0,just got the item today everything works out great but the usb could not fit into the adapter neither could any other usb as seen in the picture they all try to go in sideways and thats why they wont fit so even though the product works just fine am unable to use it which is why its three star regardless if you have normal usb ports this product will work just fine 
1,great
0,decent little wireless mouse priced good for children who tend to lose and destroy things biggest issue is the charging cable that comes with it is garbage can be charged using phone charger all in all decent purchase and would buy again 
0,i got white one and the leds shine thru the plastic the pointer tracking laser noticeably strobes will get something better made
0,did not work with our gaming console or others bought another brand no issues with it received defective product

0,i bought this month ago and taken care of it and now it can turn off you try to turn it off it turns on right way what waste of money don recommend buying jbl products 
0,the only thing that is bad is that you cannot use it on chromebook laptop without gaming tower 
0,does work for ps controller just doesn have plug to light up

0, the headphones don fit adult ears the headphones aren very loud at all turned them all the way up just to actually hear footsteps in my game the lights don work unless your in pc don care too much about that the mic sounds terrible my friends clowned me for having such god awful mic this would be the last gaming headset would buy don waste your money on this 
1,pros everything about this keyboard is really good the keys are super quiet like advertised my pc gaming setup is right next to our bed so if play at night when my wife is sleeping it does not wake her up because how silent the keys are the rgb light brightness controls are awesome too again allows me to keep the keyboard bright enough to see in dark without blinding me or my wife while she sleeps if game at night the color tones of the rgb lights are very nice pleasing to look at cons the keys feel sticky with every press feels as if there was sticky substance holding down the keys for fraction of second when depressed but only little not too big of deal but some gamers might find this very annoying there are only two rgb light options to choose from breathing effect and constant back lite would be nice if there were more lighting effect options 
0,had device months and it quit won turn on or off very disappointed way to much money for months of use 
0,games
0,the keyboard itself was lit up it was charged tried multiple usb ports and rebooted my computer also tried on another computer did not want to seem to connect wirelessly also in an attempt to get it to work thought that possibly wiring it to my computer using the charging usb port it might work just not wirelessly which did not then went through amazon tech and am now returning the product think ill be looking for another brand because im still in need of wireless backlit keyboard
1,it alright thought the led lights would come on didn know you had to plug in usb in order for them to work was so excited to give them to my boyfriend but was little disappointed about the lights other than that it amazing 
1,beautiful but not sturdy it comes with warning do not drop well dropped it twice ugh it totally won work now just bought the darn thing less than months ago passed the return window of course blame me if you want but it shouldn be that easy to break 
1,the mouse works better then expected the battery life has exceeded week so far if you have surface go this mouse will not disappoint very happy with this item would recommend 
0,i got white one and the leds shine thru the plastic the pointer tracking laser noticeably strobes will get something better made
0,this headset with microphone is nice piece of equipment for gaming 
1,my wrist no longer hurts after being on my computer sexy running lights let me see where it is on my desk love the pink color now no one can take it when there batteries are dead and claim your mouse needs batteries gotta love family ingenuity

1,i very comfortable ergonomically feel internal rechargeable batteries and instant connection while setting up for the first time took less than seconds from taking it out of the box to working the button press is also really smooth and doesn feel like hard click the roller knob at the top is fairly smooth and the transitional led lighting looks really good very happy with this purchase
0,i love the touch fell and back lighting of the keyborad but some of the lettering on the keyborad wore off

0,very good speaker
1,then it continued to be cheap piece of junk mean should have known from the price it was to good to be true never got it to charge or do anything returned 
0,decent mouse looks and feels cheap and the light show kinda adds to the cheapness of the mouse cursor tracking is the biggest issue the cursor doesnt track consistently smooth when moving it around on the screen and the dts button doesn seem to do anything for controlling this 
1,excellent quality for the price
0,na
1,really great little mouse good clicking and control the battery lasts me days at work between charges get this mouse

0,nothing really to say it didn work with my macbook
1,i use it for watching movies on my pc have to say the sound is incredible feels like in movie theartre great bang for your buck stars

1,i actually had to return this it was even christmas gift so thank god gave it early and found out it didn work whatsoever after one day of it being fine 
1,it reached my expectations it good products definitely recommend 
1,this is the first mouse have bought for my new pc probably the best purchase have made for my pc it great to use anywhere it so quiet and smooth looking it fits in the palm of my hand nicely the colors are bit off but great for how cheap it was really like that it was cheap too but it wasn cheaply made or seemed like it recommend it was bit trickcy to figure out how to connect it to my pc do have both usbc and usb on here but keep in mind that if you have usb pc you will have to take out the connecter in the mouse its hard to get it out of though do save the box for the usbc connector and charger 
0,it works very well with my macbook
0,normal daily use for few weeks scroller suddenly caved in today and stopped working positive reviews must be from people who haven owned it for long or mine was just damaged during shipping nevertheless honestly didn know computer mice could even break returning 
0,gift
0,got this for the mic was sorely disappointed not very comfortable either
1,some keyboards have very flat keys and have hard time feeling the keys these are great because the keys are slightly recessed in the middle 
1,it really great keyboard the only thing don like is that you are unable to change the color other than that it perfect 
1,i loved this mouse it is super lightweight and the color is lovely sometimes would forget to charge it after week week and half so that was on me to try to remember but just yesterday it stopped charging usually the light turns blue when it charging which is great indicator so left it overnight to charge while plugged into my laptop this morning when tried to use the mouse it didn work thought maybe hadn plugged it in properly but just now when plugged it in tested out several different usb ports on my laptop the blue charging indicator light flickered for second and then went out it seems that this mouse is not charging anymore making it basically useless 
1,i really like this this is replacement for broken battery operated one used to have love that this can charge from usb port and not having to rely on batteries or worry that they might run out at an inconvenient time it got cool lights around the side and it works well on lot of surfaces use my laptop in recliner chair and this works running on the edge of the chair just fine ve also used it on wooden table top and vinyl countertop surfaces with good results it does take just second when the laptop boots up to locate but that minimal the usb wireless component is small and fits really inconspicuously into an unused port on my laptop without being in the way at all all in all ve been very happy with the quality and efficiency this was great purchase 
0,i could not pair the mouse to my macbook air really don know why 
0,after few weeks the scroll wheel stopped working returning it 
1,we love it we can type in dark room and it so pretty 
1,used these for gaming on my pc everyone was playing with told me there was consistent background static every time cued my mic tried several different ways to correct the static from setting up the headset on the pc and updating drivers and the issue persisted the overall features of the headset were good but the static issue won work for me returned these and will be purchasing different brand 
1,some of the reviews on how this mouse did not work after the first use caused me apprehension but given the price took the risk it is just what needed and it is really pretty as well great product 
0,after exactly two months the roller wheel in the middle broke tried prying it apart and it is not fixable and is pain to always have to use the scrollbar with the mouse the lights are kind of distracting not necessary however it does stay charged for week or more at time cheap and bought this for data work it works other than the middle wheel now and is okay for the price or if you don have high expectations 
1,i had read other reviews and was excited to order and recieve my bengoo recently my neighbors have been having parties and playing music loud enough you could feel it shake the walls so was very eager to see the noise cancellation come into action as could relax while immerse myself in my game sadly it made no difference compared to my old headphones could still identify whatever song they play through the bengoo while playing games if you have an average pair of noise cancellation headphones you may want to seek premium brand of headphone though if you are seeking cheap option this is not bad option for first timers budget
1,great headphones excellent sound quality
0,thanks
1,i like that now when you answer the phone it automatically takes your call off speaker to allow for private conversation on the older models it would blast right through the speakers and you have to scramble for head phones or run to turn off the jbl speaker thank god don have to do that anymore however do wish that it was optional for only the music to continue softly in the background separate from phone conversations wouldn mind having few more of these around the house since think they link together love the speakers great sound very convenient for wherever and whenever 
1,it is exactly as depicted my old mouse just wasn working correctly even with new battery was banging on it to get it to respond this one is just as advertised changes colors and responds on just slight touch love it 
1,awesome headset wouldn go back to anybrand under dollars to replace this one amazing deal
1,i knew what was getting myself into reading the bad reviews it stops working in few weeks usually hedge my bets especially when product has so many reviews that end up with star rating alas lost this bet the scroll function key feature look for in buying mice stopped responding after few weeks fluke should buy scratcher if so because bought two one white one black and they both failed around the same time wondering if this is actually engineered to perform this way though as seeing many other reviews doing the same thing but people being bribed for star if replaced quite genius actually if you get angry customers to review it promotes product engagement but then the rating can be manipulated by replacing the cheap product and soliciting star review if this indeed is the case bravo brilliant way to get as many positive reviews for subpar product 
1,connected this speaker to bluetooth transmitter connected to my control amp great sound outside on the patio very easy to use can be used to charge your phone 
0,i have only used this shirt time it alright it does take minute to get used to the low profile my biggest complaint is that it didn come with charger as stated now have to find charger that will fit or spend more money to purchase charger just to ensure can recharge it 
0,nice speaker
1,i really liked the mouse at first it matched perfectly and was very convenient first thing noticed was how plasticy it was that didn bother me tho one day as was using the mouse to scroll the little scroll wheel fell into the mouse tried to fix it and couldn wasn pressing hard on it and it always stayed on my desk its cute mouse love the look of it but it is very cheaply made and will most likely break 
1,it very good had for about months and has not had problem the volume and sound allow for me to hear enemy foot steps the sound nob is good addition so if you are in game you can change the volume without going in and out of the game menu 
0,good overall product in sound quality connectivity battery life

1,ears are little tough compared to my cowin but it pretty comfortable the audio is also nice 
1,this mouse is super cute it is lightweight and the color matched perfectly to the picture got dark gray to match my macbook pro the click is silent which love the led lights are bright and colorful there is also setting where you can just have red lights but love the color changing the only downside is that this mouse does not hold charge long enough to last my entire workday ve started switching it off when am away from my desk and that help some charging is simple though

1,excellent for the price lighted keyboard keys are great quiet key clicks responsive 
1,has good sound but tuned more on bass side boom boom it makes hard to listen to minute details in musicit would be great if jbl provides equalizer feature in app so user can customize bass treble according to their own preference 
1,great sounds better than my charge 
0,so sad been using for months only and the scroll wheel broke already bye bye scrolling feature kind of turn off to use it now that its broken

1,overall my son is very satisfied with his headphones he uses the with his nintendo switch and the sound quality is very good for the budget price these headphones go for the microphone is average so nothing special the lights look neat and they are very comfortable if you re looking for budget pair of gaming headphones would recommend

0,i am sick with stage melonoma so just opened it it jiggles junk

0,how do attached it to bluetooth on macbook help
1,amazing sound quality battery life is horrible takes forever to charge might as well get wired speaker great bass sound but that fact the the speaker is unusable due to battery life give this star 
0,for you are better off getting wired mouse this thing is so bad the sensor light bleeds through the top shell of the mouse worse is that the actual functionality is very poor if your are looking for an accurate mouse this is not it have multi colored mouse pad and the sensor struggles between the change in shades making this mouse difficult to use if you have plain color mouse pad this may be acceptable but if your on the go this will not do 
0,i only used this mouse few times and the wheel scroll broke after months would other wise be stars
0,i bought this last year not wanting to pay for premium mouse and after seeing so many comments turns out it mistake the mouse stops working after few months when work from home the pointer just doesn react at all only the scroll works if it functional mouse it actually quite well made and like the design overall my kid loves the color sadly have to put on this review 
1,the mouse is really pretty but the battery life is super short it doesn even last my hr workday after full charge 
1,i bought my charge may th used it about times and the speaker won respond it won turn off or play not worth it 
1,this mouse is very comfortable and the colors are super cool it also very economical and works well highly recommend 
1,i love the back lighting rechargeable battery and light personally only sit at desk when playing games mostly like wireless so don have to sit at flat surface for the keyboard use like to sit back from my computer on inch monitor tv for emails you tube videos and browsing the internet while holding the keyboard only when changing websites your design makes that harder to pick up or hold with the left hand and typing with the right the keys go to the very edge of the unit only the bottom and right top corner have spot to use thumb to hold without touching key little more area on right side would be ideal for many users comfort when holding the board especially near the esc key an another model perhaps flared out going to the top 
0,my headphones arrived faulty and do not connect to my pc properly followed the setup instructions provided watched videos yet nothing helped returning these asap 
1,very good sound for its size loud enough and at top volume it still has clear sound

1,everything about this speaker is awesome 
1,love this product really fits my personality and does its job great

0,i bought these to replace my boyfriends old falling apart headphones and he loves them he games every night and said that they where much comfier than his old ones 
1,the headset is really comfortable it feels natural on the head my friends can hear me really well when play and hear them just fine you can hear what going on out side the headset but not real well use it for gaming and really like it over all really good headset 
0,i got it for my husband he chose his colors lol it worked with daily use for about month until it died that when we figured we have to charge it which was fine but we cannot figure out how to tell when the battery is low and it needs charging 
1,this speaker seems very sturdy and durable don plan to use it around water so won comment on how well it works when wet the sound is amazing for such small device very rich tone and lots of bass overall very satisfied 
0,the mouse has nice small design and like how it feels when you click but unfortunately the hardware is not high quality the charging port has stopped working 
1,great outdoor speaker to keep on the patio or take to the beach it is mono speaker so better for portable or outdoor use great color 
1,had this for few months now still works perfectly stays charged for at least week and you can still use it while its plugged in charging ive dropped it few times and the cover has come off but snapped back on easily no damage perfect for use with my laptop if you dislike touchpads like do this is great solution for good price
1,very good product love the way it lights up charges very easy and battery last long time before recharge 
1,so cute great night light long battery no issues loveeeee it oh and it also pauses by itself when not in use which is cool
0,sound is muffled lights vibrant but useless unless you re connecting to laptop for gaming the split is too short to connect it to the console what makes it light up and simultaneously to the gaming controller what makes it useful so for gaming the lights will not be on while wearing the headset mic like so many other complaints doesn work returning this item 
0,only last months before it quit working
0,i ve had of these randomly stop working in the last year both stopped clicking after minimal use less than days on the first one less than for the second don understand why this product is so highly rated it terrible learn from my mistakes 
0,after months it does not work any more 
1,the headset is perfect for gaming purposes the sound quality is extravagant
0,it no for me 
1,perfect size and most of all excellent sound 
0,this mouse was waste of money it broke after using it one month bought another mouse couple weeks ago and it will not charge do not recommend this mouse 
1,overall sound is good but doesn get very loud almost certain my flip was louder and more even in sound this would be good with another to run in stereo but the bass is still lacking unless you put it in spot with lot of sound deflection or corner 
0,regardless of where you plan to use this product home school or work you can go wrong with this product it quality product at great price ve had mine less than week now and just ordered another one add little light in your life 
1,great feel full size keyboard that is wireless and has blacklighting bought this because several keys quit working on my laptop don really use this for gaming but love size and the feel of the keystrokes it also has built in battery so you can just recharge instead of having to replace batteries all the time very happy with this purchase 
1,recently purchased this mouse the look of the lights is cool not fan of the sleep mode but did love the smooth feel of movement and the track wheel was perfect however after day and half went to charge it and it never came back on thought it needed to charge longer but no just stopped working 
1,it is great my brother loved it he used every day and it was great investment great product for christmas gift for the gamers 
0,only took month or so for the mike to go out 
0,could use an instruction sheet also what is the expected battery life on single charge 
0,really cute mouse but only used it once and now it wont even turn on 
1,comfortable soft keys great responsiveness and retraction 
1,my husband is fascinated with these he loves the colors the lights the quality definitely good buy 
1,worked good at first now after only very little use in two months time it won take charge would definitely stay away fro this product
0,it seemed to work ok for couple of days and then started noticing that it wasn moving my cursor where wanted it to go sometimes have to move it real fast just to find the cursor no matter what did it took an extraordinary amount of time to get it to land in the right spot gave up and started using my old mouse again 
1,initially my preference was the bose soundlink mini ii with its smooth notes and decent sound quality in small transportable package that is until heard comparison against jbl charge on youtube based on that review and others purchased this speaker for its waterproof multi connect and sound great price you can buy charge direct from jbl for with color options with price point being on par with amazon sounds great excellent better describes it if you have charge there isn enough improvement to justify buying charge the charge went from two smaller speakers to one slightly larger speaker which improved bass frequency from hz to deeper hz when the jbl arrived we conducted our own comparison against bose soundlink mini ii and wow the charge is much clearer has better frequency response and has better sound presence in the room it bit larger and heavier than the soundlink mini ii which might turn some off but to me if going to carry any speaker like this then taking the same care and am sure can find just little more room good packaging but no instructions not that charging and setup are all that difficult but this is my first device that requires usb first anything that arrived with zero printed information and rechargeable device that arrived with zero anything to charge it with setup was easy bought usb cable from the nearest gas station and plugged it in for hours since it came somewhat charged already once charged press the bluetooth button then connect to your phone or other device for settings always recommend phone volume to be no more than to volume then using the charge volume from there this affords you plenty of up down volume adjustment remotely from your phone and doesn task the internal sound processor this since it cheaper to replace repair charge than an expensive smartphone you and someone else can be bluetooth paired to this speaker at the same time battery life the built in rechargeable li ion mah battery is strong not only does it support up to hours of playtime at lowest setting and figure hours at half volume but it will also charge your phone and other devices via the usb port strongly suggest buying protective case for it which will hold your charger usb charging cable and any spare usb cable needed for cell phones it has the same ipx waterproof as iphone samsung or other higher end smartphone we place it on the deck without any worries of accidents from fluid spills big splashes being left in the rain or even an accidental swim in the pool having that peace of mind alone is priceless jbl connect with connect you can connect several of these to together for full sound experience put in opposing corners of large room in different rooms indoor and outdoors heck even in your car if your current stereo or speakers are crap bottom line this being my first bluetooth speaker ever and having friends that have made different choices for the speakers they have have zero regrets with my purchase after hearing it beside theirs bang for buck is spot on have excellent sound in transportable package in wireless speaker that is rugged waterproof and allows multiple speakers as well as people to connect now proudly own the party favorite speaker for socials events and private enjoyment win

1,love it as it multi functional
1,as far as portable bt speakers go it does the job music comes out sounds pretty clear and is loud enough for small outdoor area keep of these by the pool on each side and link them together with stereo sound good way to have music in the pool area without having to wire speakers and such thinking about getting more in order to cover more area but these will do for now 
0,died right after the day return window ended edit customer service sent replacement
0, not so great with the rendering dragging objects with the mouse is not so great especially acrosss screens work on visio lot and its just very hard to get this to drag stuff around so basically has bad sensor but its smooth and very quiet

1,just perfect 
1,my son had this for maybe months and the cord started coming out of the headset itself then wouldn work this seller took their time and sent us new headset after the st one we had broke they are awesome and take very good of their customers 
1,the sound quality is very clear and perfect for gaming on the ps mic is clear very happy with these 
1,the headset is pretty well built the only drawback is the extra long cord that connects to the controller 
1,this mouse worked great for the days it worked tried turning it on today and it wont light up or connect to my computer tried connecting with the cord provided but still wont work sucks because the outlook of the mouse was cool along with the led outlining 
0,wow the headset has incredible sound base will make your belly shake not all ambient noise is cancelled but can hear the tv and talking in the background all that for under 
0,when bought this headset the mic is very bad and when talked in it my friends could barely hear me would have to scream into the mic for them to hear me also in order for the led lights to work you have to have pc also it says there noise cancelation and when tried could hear everything my friend said behind me and he was whispering the sound quality is ok but not good enough for almost the bass sucks too would not recommend 
1,the headphones are great they are very comfortable and has good sound quality for an affordable price don recommend using the headphones on laptops because it bent weird and messed up the wiring so bought another one and use the messed up one for the laptop other than that they are great 
0,this speaker is worth every penny 
1,sound quality is great we bought this for the pool and the boat it plenty loud and battery stay charged for hours 
0,i loved how the noise cancelling worked 
0,just had mouse for months and it has stopped working 
1,omg this is literally one of the best mouse ve used in quite while previously was using small hp mouse and it gave me hand cramps over time however since switching this mouse has revived my fingertips to give me better mobility as complete my college assignments or even surf the web 
1, pretty and sleek just opened it says to charge for hours with usb cable in box umm what cable luckily have plenty of chargers so once use it shall update review update works as it should love the color changing no complaint 
0,the usb plug for the pc is totally useless as the pc will constantly complain about an unknown device plugged into the port contacted support what joke told me to return the product for another one no thank you this goes in the garbage where it belongs no quality control they sent me an email wanted to send me replacement no already threw it away as it stopped working you can buy my good review with cash or another of your defective products do not buy wish had read the customer reviews junk 
0,this mouse stopped working one month in despite being charged and taken to my company tech desk to be looked at to see if was the problem 
1,the best 
1,i like the color and the changing light the sleep mode is nice and saves battery life when you are not moving the mouse 
1,it strange to hold but it works for it intended purpose it not completely silent but it quiet and that good enough for me 
0,quit working trashed it
1,perfect for kids 
0,very frustrated and upset had it exactly for days and out of it used times and it already stopped working save your money 
0,wanted to match my keyboard and not spend too much money this little number is priced just right and the size and shape make it easy to use 
1,this is perfect for gaming
1,constantly had to charge cool light effects came at cost ended up going to target and buying one that works much better and is battery operated 
1,these were great for the money they work well with the xbox one sounds good
1,it is really great it don need charge for days then finally dead on me love it really cute and colorful use lots use with my macbook pro 
1,the speaker is very awesome with great quality sound it is bright red so it does not get misplaced any where in the office the portability of the speaker is pretty amazing too 
1,love the color and led lights 
1,i love the feel of this mouse it is comfortable easy to set up rechargeable wireless and the lights are so pretty fast shipping and quality packaging would highly recommend 
1,they work good for the price would recommend buying for the price
0,there typo on the mouse mouse works good though there is minor glitch where it tends to not want to move on screen for couple seconds after touching it after couple minutes of inactivity 
0,did not work well for me only worked when it felt like it very inconsistent 
0,excelente quality sound and battery life 
0,for gaming 
0,not sure yet if the price justifies the product 
0,very frustrating as they both broke on the same day about month after purchase and too late to return 
0,maybe this is just personal preference but the single offset speaker is very distracting if you hold it in front of you you can immediately notice that there no sound coming from the left side initially thought maybe mine was defective as why would such an expensive device be mono did more research and learned it was designed that way the sound quality is still excellent just personally can look past the unequal sound distribution 
0,this does not fit on my laptop the part that fits into the laptop to make the mouse work did not fit 
0,for self entertainment
1,works well with macbook for gameplay love the changing light and ergonomic
1,overall the headset works really well it is really easy to set up and the sound is awesome the ear muffs make it easy to put on due to their large size my last headset would make my ears hurt this one has an easy mute button and the cord is made out of material that would make it last long time you really do not have to worry about it breaking and in the off chance it does the company provides great warranty for their products 
1,the reason why bought this was because wanted better sound quality when played video games the reason why it is good is because it has good sound quality for example you can hear lot of things with the headphones like where things are say you can hear someone you know if they are on the right or the left the next reason is that it has long cord so it doesn make you lean forward when you play game for example when you use normal headphones the cord is so short that when you plug it in you have to lean forward to make sure that you can use it these headphones you have no problem the last reason is that it has the ability to connect to all devices for example you can connect it to things like pc ps xbox ect after using them think that would recommend them 
0,my son only used this gaming headset for few months and the mic already quit working very disappointed 
0,use for gaming noise cancellation could be better 
1, so far so good had previous mouse that gave out after months and check the cool colors

1,great for ps lacks macro buttons looks great but cant change the light effects 
0,i ve been pc gaming since the not sure what makes this gaming keyboard there aren any special keys for hot binding the back lit keys look cool but are completely useless if you know how to type ll keep my opinion on pc gamers who don know the keyboard layout to myself so far haven had an issue with key lag or battery life but just got it this week did make sure it was fully charged before used it otherwise it just basic wireless keyboard it not fancy or special so far it done what ve needed it to do

1,sound quality bluetooth size is amazing 
1,dear jbl next model update it would be nice to have strap or lanyard have flip and an extreme and they all have either strap or lanyard which use often both for work and play otherwise no complaints 
1,my year old son loves it lights match his led desk mouse pad lights and his lenovo legion gaming mouse along with his legion laptop it works well for virtual school this year and online gaming overall great purchase 
0,love the slimline appearance and the changing colors the colors add sense of fun to normally mundane piece of computer equipment also love the ability to keep it one color red or allow it to change colors and the ability to change the speed of the cursor good product well designed make sure you are aware of the button on the bottom as it is not just an on off switch but has three positions this is now october this mouse broke after little use while traveling the scroll wheel broke inside the mouse making it useless this appears to be poor design and weak point in this item and would now not recommend it have had other computer mice for years without this issue 
0,it decent mouse lower middle in quality but reasonable price at fifteen feels kinda cheap wheel is noisy 
1,less months old worked great at first and now it won charge it crap

1,hands down the best headphones ve ever used can beat the incredible price either run don walk to get yours now 
1,tested this out after charging it so far so good 
0,i bought this yesterday to replace broken mouse day has incredibly noticeable lag fully charged it before using it it runs about the same as turtle stuck in syrup this isn worth just buy different mouse update the brand behind this sent me an email from shady address claiming to be amazon custom service and offered me to delete the review not chance urge you to stay away from this brand they re shady af they ll try to scam you after you buy their scummy product 
0,this mouse is awful bought six weeks ago and one of them died in less than week the other just died got less than months out of these and now have to go looking again for more reliable one avoid this it looks nice but it doesn last
1,bought as gift for great grandson and he loves it 
0,update after about weeks of use it just completely stopped working ve been using it plugged into the computer via the charger because the wireless connection is so inconsistent but today when got home from work it just not working didn get it wet didn drop it etc can think of any reason for it to just randomly stop working but it did wireless or plugged in the keyboard still lights up with the rainbow color but doesn acknowledge any key strokes caps and num lock don light up and my computer just keeps saying device not responding when try to manually connect it don throw your money away buy functional keyboard from reputable brand not some shoddy chinese company with positive review bots original this keyboard has some sort of timer so it will turn off when it not used it about seconds when it plugged in it comes with ridiculously short usb cable maybe feet long and seconds or so when being used wirelessly when it automatically turns off it takes anywhere from seconds to turn back on and reconnect to bluetooth before it starts registering keystrokes again it constant annoyance that makes most games frustratingly unplayable and can figure out any way to disable it really can recommend this to anybody it truly makes games unplayable and any other computer activity annoying and frustrating with lot of wasted time waiting for it to reconnect gonna have to return this garbage and get new wireless keyboard 
0,i was not fond of this mouse the ergonomics too flat or charge life now after months of average to minimum use it will not charge my system gives an error message of malfunctioning device tried different usb cord with the same response donot recommend this mouse 
0,this mouse is almost unusable because of how loud every scroll is took the top off to make sure there wasn something stuck in there to create this awful sound and it was clean just poorly designed cheap wasn expecting the greatest mouse for this low price point but this is just obnoxious 
0,sound really good 
1,sound is great love the led lights matches perfect with my game room thanks 
0,excelente product
0,purchased may th and usb broke apart by july th save your money 
0,the product lasts about minutes and dies have charged it so many times and it still needs to be plugged in to work even when plugged in it still only lasts another minutes seller is in violation of amazon terms of agreement continually contacting customer private email asking to remove review review is factual and customer will continue to report abuse to amazon through email community help com do not purchase product due to poor quality and unregulated customer service practices 
1,love it have had many portable speakers knowing full well that portability would sacrifice sound quality not so with my jbl charge great sound so easy to connect works great in the yard and on my boat got great deal on it as well definitely would like to try out the connect feature when pick up another one 
1,picked up bluetooth fast and sound quality is amazing
0,great little board but they need to alter the led settings mainly the thing needs to not fall asleep on me in the dark cuz its getting old 
1,was going back and forth trying to figure out which jbl speaker to purchase finally settled on the charge because all the jbl products are great and it has been the best purchase that have made the sound is great and it very loud speaker for its size would recommend to anybody in the market for travel speaker

1,love these jbls great sound
1,very comfortable and great sound quality
0,it fancy looking keyboard that doesn break your bank rgb lights are well illuminated and keys are ok too keys could be little noisy the biggest problem is you can use the left ctrl and shift buttons together even though the battery life is reasonable the keyboard doesn have proper battery indicator that tells you how much charge left so you might get frustrated when the keyboard suddenly decides to stop in the middle of the work 
1,it was for my grandsons birthday he loves it he can hear is mother now

1,i was pleased to see just how well made the mouse was when received it couldn have asked for more for the money it comfortable in my hand the rubber texture really makes using it pleasure the dongle storage on the bottom of the mouse isn covered but it nice and tight so not worried about losing it so far so good 
1,the main thing for me is that it is really pretty maybe that just girl reason to like it but am girl and an artist and maybe wee bit eccentric want stuff around me to add to my environment especially now other than that well its mouse it does all the same things other computer mice do and it does it well and its pretty

1,i bought this because hate using the mouse pad on my laptop and it great to throw in my laptop bag and pull out when need it it charges by plugging it into the laptop but haven had to do that yet besides giving it full charge when opened it up the first time it does go into sleep mode to save the battery which took minute to figure out but once you realize that it not broken just asleep it all good overall it just basic wireless mouse that works well and is sleek and portable

0,beyond what expected bought more
1,bought this headset for my son to play fortnite on the nintendo switch and he loves it after buying much more expensive headset that did not work right this one was much better choice 
1, update after yr of usage used the keyboard almost everyday for whole year mostly for work rather than gaming and it is still like new then one day had to switch out my laptop at work and forgot to take the usb receiver before turning it in unfortunately couldn retrieve it and was beating myself up for it going back to using the laptop keys was highly excruciating so decided to take chance and ask if the usb receiver was replaceable their customer service is phenomenal the same rep communicated with me throughout the process have you ever played hot potato with customer service then you know how amazing this feels and she always responded pretty quickly to my emails there was never lag time the only hiccup ran into was at the very beginning when searched for customer service portal through amazon the initial link connected me with the klim technical riding gear rather than klim technologies however they gave me the correct email address immediately and it was smooth sailing from there they told me the usb receiver is replaceable yayyyy but that part was on backorder was more happy to know be able to continue using the keyboard so was willing to wait month later they provided an update that the part was still on backorder but that they were going to send me new one it arrived as promised and can go back to typing comfortably and with lightening speed just got it and have only used it for couple of hours but thoroughly impressed by this keyboard smooth buttons smooth typing comfortable feel and full sized buttons and now have number key pad the presentation was also impressive black little envelope with seemingly personalized note with little flare from the makers when you open the box love it just the quality of the keys make it obvious that it will be great for game play the keys feel so light and smooth under my fingers as type hope it lasts forever

1,this mouse is amazing its super quiet when clicking and it runs smooth even on bed sheets it works on any surface 
1,when first got the item the color looked off ordered the blue but fairly positive based on the images was sent mint green liked the quiet button clicks and it was nice to have in college classes for bit because it was so quiet however after only week and half the mouse wheel stopped working could feel the tension in the wheel was gone so opened it to investigate and it looked like there was small plastic rod that rotated with the wheel but the contact point between the rod and wheel was broken so it wouldn work anymore liked the aesthetics of it except for the red led used for the tracking would also overpower the rgb lights it bothered me but that didn affect the function wish this had worked better 
0,verry good
0,didn work would not charge
0,it worked for about weeks plus afew days before it stopped working

0,can evaluate the battery life because it brand new 
1,beautiful headset comfortable to wear and great sound quality only headset ll ever use 
0,the mouse was stunning when first got it it was very fluent but the one problem and very major problem for me was the fact that the mouse kept left clicking every time right clicked and my chromebook didn have setting to fix it overall it was just an annoying issue 
1,works very well thanks 
1,i like the color and sound of the product but the material could be better looks like cheap plastic
0,the cord is way too long it and it gets tangled up because it is so long and sometimes it cuts out so can only hear in one ear and have to fiddle with the cord to try and fix it the mic cancels most noise but the headset does not cancel any noise and since have fan on can hear it with my headset on and it gets annoying while trying to game 
0,just quick note linux compatible out of the box nice mouse

1,sleek quite cool light effect great price for rechargeable mouse no more batteries to replace 
1,my boys love to game on their computer xbox and nintendo switch this headset is great for all gaming experience great sound and microphone the only reason did not give it stars is the cord can get tangled easily and when that happens it doesn give the star experience have bought several of these though and will continue to get the same as they get worn out the price for the quality of the product is worth it 
0,liked the colors and style east set up but after about weeks of use the scroller stopped working and fell off track only used it few times out of those weeks 
1,bought it in march and now the roller thing does not work mouse was never dropped opened and found that the attachment of the roller is broken it works as intended and love that it is rechargeable ll buy another one if it lasts long enough then maybe the first one is just fluke 
1, wanted to find very nice and stylish mouse and ran across this one it was so very easy to connect to my laptop and very lightweight love the colorful light display ve been using the wireless mouse for few days and it appears to hold good charge you can go wrong with this charger and the price was very reasonable compared to other brands with the same capabilities 
0,i could only hear on one side of the headset but everything else works 
1,really like the feel of the mouse in my hand have dropped it numerous times and it keeps working like charm so far am really pleased with it
1,awesome product awesome company rechargeable rainbow keyboard yes please this is definitely the most bang for your buck 
1,i bought this because trying to minimize the amount of wires on my desk and because the color matches my pc case but it not worth it the mouse barely works and it takes forever to get it to actually click on what you want like it pretty and the colors are cute but those are the only good things about this thankfully play with controller so it doesn hinder my gaming but if you do play mouse and keyboard absolutely don get this 
0,was so excited to get this it stopped working after one month changed the battery but no go bought it to relieve my carpal tunnel pain and that was great but it just stopped working 
1,the mic is really great and has good sound quality was amazed that it was as good as it is for the price you pay for it but the only downside to it is the mic doesn have the clearest of sound and you kinda sound like you re in box but would recommend it to anyone who looking for cheap mic with great sound quality 
1,have to charge it twice day at least it is not comfortable too small to fit nicely in my hand the flow is choppy the cursor sticks it feels cheap like it is going to break at any second 
1,this was nice mouse wouldn recommend for children as it broke when dropped on floor adult use seems like it would be fine 
1,my son used these for weeks and they shortages out very disappointing they were gift we tried signing up for the warranty but had to jump through hoops sure we were even approved 
1,sound is pretty good for the price
0,came quickly easy to set up delivery person put in spot close to door and knocked to let me know it was there door bell not working and he was wearing his mask

0,bass is very good 
0,flashing lighted keyboard wholly separate from laptop performs the task needed big smiles

0,waste of your money
0,the mic doesn work after week
0,best headphones for the buck didn have any problems
1,got good deal nice item was exactly as described 
1,i like that it is excellent to use it 
0,worked well at first few months later all incoming sounds came in sounding like the speakers were blown they just keep getting worse it so difficult understanding people 
1,awesome
1,sound is awesome plus water proof is bonus 
1,it really nice everyday mouse the sleep mode is little irritating because it kicks on so quickly and there doesn seem to be way to change it don think it would be great for gaming given its limited buttons and the sleep mode thing but it great for office use 
1,love job products battery life is amazing last pretty much hours use it in my home gym no complaints at all
1,love the colors so far ok
0,just couldn get the thing to work with both audio and mic at the same time

0,thks
0,usb dongle fell apart shorted my computer then would not work or would notlet my computer go into sleep mode had this less than year normal use 
1,hi have purchased this product for my daughter so happy with the overall looks and performance will recommend you to buy great buy 
0,if you can spend the extra money and buy something little better quality
0,worked great after first charge then became choppy and uncontrollable very disappointed in this mouse 
1,love this mouse mouse came days before delivery eta which was always nice love that it rechargeable no more dead batteries mid work shift mouse connected right away to my thinkpad ordered the white and the illuminating changing colors look awesome mouse is low profile with really nice feel to it tend to run through computer mice pretty quick so only time will tell for longevity so far it for me do note with the white version the colors bleed through the top as you can see in the picture and video however still looks cool to me just different than the advertised photos 
1,i bought mine in mint green it almost effortlessly easy to set up the battery is lasting beautifully absoulutely love it soooo much just ordered my daughter one in the dark gray she going to love the led lights thank you 
1,exactly what was looking for sleek and quiet and also pretty with the lights you can turn the rainbow lights off if you don want them on 
1,i have flip and this charge ive played both and im little disappointed with the charge my flip has stereo speakers and frankly sounds just as good if not even better then my charge its weird the flip sounds amazing from low volume to almost highest volume where the charge doesn sound as nice at low volume but will keep up at higher levels almost pushing out about the same volume as its smaller sibling flip the only thing consider the charge to have over the flip is it doesn get too distorted at max volume like the flip but the flip just sounds great almost at any level but at max maybe little less bass on the flip too but not by much im beginning to regret my charge purchase wish just went with new flip and see how that works out btw used the charge for hotel room bluetooth soundbar since live in hotels while working each month so good sound means lot to me especially when get noise complaints from the host 
0,works as described 
0,very good product
0,the key board looks amazing but some of the keys don work and delete to name few 
1,this is my first speaker and love it love the bass especially like to play my lofi music at night when doing homework and the sound quality makes the energy in the room feel so much more calm and relaxing when playing my regular jams on low can still hear the bass when leave the room to go to the other side of the house and it sounds like there party next door putting it in the bathtub while you shower makes the sound expand in way so that makes for an exciting experience this speaker is 
1,my son loves it its really great for noise cancellation and sound quality its very comfortable
1,works great only have to charge it once every weeks and use it daily at the office 
1,first of all the speaker is monaural and you need two to get stereo that then you need an app to convince the speakers to play in stereo and there is no app for windows or mac only mobile devices tried an android emulator but you can get to bluetooth that way so forget it the app is crappy too it takes at least two tries each time to convince the speakers to play in stereo and the app has to be left running after while something times out the sound reverts to monaural and the app has to be closed and re started to make it stereo again the only reason this speaker gets so many good reviews is that apparently most people don care about stereo sound what waste so good sound or not these are going back both of them 
1,i ve only had this for few months but not only is it really cool looking it responsive and comfortable to use 
1,for the price you really can beat this deal the sound is great and they are comfortable 
0,it broke the mouse is unresponsive the wheel is isolated it is inconvenient having to charge the mouse every few uses through cable it 
0,no dislikes
1,great sound quality for the medium size speaker if you want more bass and louder sound go with the xtreme series and smaller get the flip returned my flip for this one because wanted louder sound 
0,mouse works good
0,stopped working after week even if plugged it into the computer
1,mouse feels like it of good quality and so far haven had any issues with it working with my xps
1,just lays there like squash pretty colors when you press on the keys but the keys don work keyboard that doesn type done trying to get this thing to work just basic run of the mill piece of crap that has pretty lights 
0,i have been using this mouse for days and the scroll wheel broke completely when pressed it it was alright in its short days comfortable but the scroll wheel clicked very loudly which didn like don waste your money 
1,i didn like the way the light shown thru the top like the plastic was super thin and semi transparent and it didn come thru evenly have been using it for while now and it sometimes gives me trouble have to tap the bottom to get the red light back on and the wheel stops working sometimes just unplug usb and plug back in fixes it still stars because at this price it great 
1,great gaming headset for the price 
1,this would be star but in order to use light on headphones you have to plug it in that wouldn be bad but the cord to plug it into ur xbox is super short you would have to latterly but on top of the system to use it other than that they are fine don buy this for the light because they probably won be close enough to the tv to use it 
0,this product is garbage didn even get charging cord oh and by the way the mouse come out the box broken not working returning and running to better name brand 
1,my year old loves these he looks and feels like super gamer now 
0,like other reviews stated this mouse is super nice smooth and looks neat but lasted just over the day return window put it on charge for the th time since had received it and the blue light comes on indicating it is charging and goes off some time later indicating it is complete when you switch it on the red light flashes and then goes off highly disappointing 
1,if you own an xbox or ps gaming console do not waste your money on this headset does it work with either gaming system technically yes you can plug it into your controller and use the microphone and speakers to play games however you will not be able to plug the usb into your controller for the led lights the dual plugs are designed to be used on computer gaming system you would have to get very long usb extension cord to plug into your console unless you own pc gaming system save your money and buy something another headset 
1,it came very quick and my son loves it sound is clear and plenty of slack woth long cord to walk around and be very dramatic while talking to other players love it will be purchasing from them very soon thanks
0,i was naive and thought wireless meant bluetooth but it doesn make sure you read everything carefully the colours change really smoothly though 
1,got this for my mother as christmas present and she uses it every day and absolutely loves it 
1,sleek and nice love the colors great buy 
1,some might like long cord but this is bit long wish the usb port was disconnected and could be an attachment the headphones themselves are great the look is beautiful the lights are nice touch the microphone is bit stiff moving up and down but that fine 
1,nice springy keys that are smooth to type comfortable arrangement and like the backlight also very thoughtful letter from the manufacturers would highly recommend keep it up 
0,not suitable for long term it broke after months 
1,i ve been using this keyboard for about three months and ve only had to charge it about twice using it about hours day it definitely not the best gaming keyboard but for the price would say good buy

0,i never dropped the speaker or put it in water dont know why the speaker does not charge anymore only had this speaker for about weeks 
0,didn realize that there wasn place to put battery in so it always had to be charged after two or three weeks could no longer charge it and could not have it work cheaply made would not recommend if you need it long term or if you spend lot of time on the computer
0,i bought this mouse so could have something rather than trackpad for college read the manual and did everything to get this mouse to work the softwares that are compatible with this mouse are older have the macos this mouse is only compatible with the macos if you re looking for mouse and you re in the same situation as me this one isn it 
1,very cool design thanks
1, feels good in my hand and works well the roller wheel works as third button which is important for my work colors are pretty and you can turn the lights off so that bonus it charges so no batteries and loving that the only issue finding is that it goes to sleep very fast if you wait to long to move it you have to click the power like next to the roller wheel not big deal just annoying sometimes overall happy with it 
0, chinese junk lasted month
0,first of all not worth the money you pay for not comfortable for gaming and broken buttons since had wired dell keyboard for gaming amazing stuff used years and still was in good shape

1,this mouse is super cute it is lightweight and the color matched perfectly to the picture got dark gray to match my macbook pro the click is silent which love the led lights are bright and colorful there is also setting where you can just have red lights but love the color changing the only downside is that this mouse does not hold charge long enough to last my entire workday ve started switching it off when am away from my desk and that help some charging is simple though 
1,batter life is pretty good and overall great keyboard only complaint is the light is little dim

1,there really isn anything to dislike about this mouse the setup process is virtually non existent you just plug in the usb and you re good to go have been using it for more than week and haven had to charge it yet the light display is neat added bonus great for dark room adventures long story short it does what expected but better great buy 
1,bought for gift for my dad he loves it and he takes it everywhere says the battery life is crazy and the sound is just what he was looking for thanks jbl
0,this mouse did horrible things to my laptop no longer have working usb hubs also get warning message about malfunction on the computer and that does not go away and if get it to go away constantly have flashing image in the bottom right hand corner of my laptop screen took this mouse and my laptop computer to best buy and it was determined that the mouse had indeed ruined the usb hubs and would have had to have sent my computer off for repair and cannot do that because the laptop is for business would never ever recommend this product to anyone for any reason ever 
1,it works great fits my hand great only thing is the lights don work at efficiently happy with the product overall

0,taiwan 
1,i bought this mouse so that could use it with my macbook unfortunately it barely works have tried for year now to get it to different surfaces and different ways to try and make it function better but it extremely slow and very glitchy and ends up slowing you down so much more than just using whatever mouse pad is on the laptop it extremely lightweight and made from cheap plastic was expecting that at least it would work but the lag time is so great that you re better off not using it at all 
1,it was great value it arrived quickly it works great the usb doesn fit my port but the mouse only need usb 
0,i ve only used this product once and it stopped working after only using it for an hour and half after being fully charged it says just two hours of charging can last days but obviously that lie the usb receiver also arrived broken don waste your money on this 
1,this mouse is garbage buyer beware doesn hold charge doesn move the cursor bought for separate computers and its the same for both amazon basics mouse is better
0,the last two we bought stopped working within months 
0,overall good set of headphones they are slightly tight for the wearer so he avoids them when he has headache 
1,got the mouse hooked up and at first it didn work light up but rgb function and connection to pc didn work figured out it needed to sit and fully charge for everything to work mouse was doing great until found issue with its sleep mode when the mouse falls asleep to save battery it wakes up very quickly however from that point on its control over the cursor becomes delayed it ping is tripled and you can watch the cursor stick and then start to move again while moving the mouse turned the mouse off and back on again to resolve this problem so the sleep feature on this mouse is terrible have to turn it on and off as needed 
1,son loved it 
1,this is by far the best portable speaker that have ever purchased have another speaker that thought was good one but it was lacking volume and clarity once compared it to this one this unit keeps long charge and can charge my phone also 
0,like others have reported the mouse curser jumps around and blinks after short min period of use making it difficult to control and sometimes nonresponsive you have to move it gently to get it to go anywhere with precision charged it over the weekend thinking the battery was not fully charged but the same results this morning have requested refund and will be purchasing something that works 
1,i use this on my xbox one they are too quiet to hear well they take lot enjoyment out of the game 
0,the crazy mouse will not hold charge have to plug it in after minutes of use defeats the purpose of wireless mouse my alkaline battery mouse would last for months and then just simple battery replacement do not buy 
1,it seems to work fine so far the lights around the side are constantly red until well charged but then they rotate very easy to set up but does not seem to work when wired 
0,did not work on my computer

1,awesome for gaming and work
0,i bought this and after few months the center stopped working so cant scroll at all also it doesn click terrible product 
1,very nice bluetooth speaker with powerful bass and clean sound 
1,it functions very well as wireless mouse the usb adapter it comes with is very handy for the new apple computers which only have usb ports the lights are cool as well but more importantly the mouse is sturdy and doesn feel cheap 
1,the scrolling wheel is not working properly after months so have to buy new mouse the usb charging feature is nice though and it is easy to carry 
0,the on off switch is on the bottom ofthe keyboard you have to pick it up and flip it over it is very small and in an indent and hard to move going to be chaging it lot 
1,i love the color rose gold and it works great on variety of surfaces just wish it would alert me when the battery is low so can charge it before need it for work 
0,this is high quality and nice looking
1,great headset and great experience with great quality 
1,i love the color changing feature while using
0,the keyboard is great in general but the usb receiver broke off in my usb port after months they really should either include more than one receiver or make them more robust and of higher quality 
0,my ue old lives it
1,very nice bluetooth speaker with fantastic battery life the sound is clear though would appreciate bit more bass to balance the sound overall very good high quality speaker 
0,thank you 
0,the product is cheap and worked well for the first months
1,it works really well and have no problem with it 
0,this is the worst wireless mouse ve ever had the displeasure of using bought it thinking how bad can it really be it just needs to connect to my laptop well if this could be negative star rating would do it if you stop moving the mouse for seconds or more you have to turn it off and then turn it back on again because it loses its tracking and doesn respond to your movements it doesn have any accuracy while clicking things and its uncomfortable to use it is garbage 
1,very sleek keyboard it is wireless however it lasts for quite some time before you have to recharge it it performs very well lightweight with soft keys the lights are absolutely beautiful
1,absolutely in love exceeded expectations highly reccomend 
1,received with everything shown even came charged and ready for use gave this to my boyfriend for christmas and it was great gift it can be used from far away for when your laptop is connected to the tv through the hdmi cord with no problem 
1,i got this mouse for my daughter and she was beyond excited when we finally received it well day it wouldn charge so gave it break and decided to try charging it on my mac she had originally tried her school chrome book few seconds of it being plugged in it started smoking it smelled like burning plastic so quickly just unplugged and didn bother doing anything else with the mouse 
1,fits my hand perfect like the lites and the sleep mode to save battery life 
1,this device does play in stereo ve seen several reviews say that it doesn but can verify you will hear the various channels in the music you won regret getting this just be very gentle with the cable that charges it and the plug ins don power jam the buttons it doesn require an ape like approach to use this speaker when you press the power button there delay lightly press and listen feel for the button to click then just wait few seconds it will come to life battery life is awesome use it every day at the office for hours and charge it maybe twice week good product yes it stereo anyone who says otherwise doesn have the ears and intelligence to know what stereo really is 
0,i fully charged the mouse used once and then it quit working it will still light up but no mouse on the screen 
1,really good headset considering the price would highly recommend this to any gamer wanting quality headset for an amazing price 
0,from what read this would plug into an android tablet have so that could control without using the touch screen but the adaptor did not allow this my mistake probably

1,this is great mouse quiet responsive fun color 
0,i was naive and thought wireless meant bluetooth but it doesn make sure you read everything carefully the colours change really smoothly though 
1,i in love with my speaker the sound quality is amazing the battery lasts for long time and it so easy to connect it to my phone and devices connected it to my laptop to watch movie and it made me feel like was in movie theater again highly recommended buying this speaker 
0,most think this will work on gaming console partially they will but how the console is designed there is no usb port next to an audio outlet there fore the player is left to choose between the lights on the earphones working or the audio working and we all know audio is must so all that is left is whats the point of the lights if you cant use em while gamethese are computer gaming earphones
0,i am big on reviews peoples honest opinions when it counts as for style it nice mouse but for the main purpose of the mouse it is not good even if it completely charged it will only work for about minutes before it starts to freeze then eventually go dead it very frustrating annoying especially if you work from home would of posted pic but am in the process of returning it don feel like getting it 
0,i like it
1,it is comfortable to use the changing colors add visual interest
0,it broke at the first fall and it was not big fall the inner clips on broke and the other twisted so am unable to close it and simpler does it work

1,fast shipping and fast delivery works really well and fits perfectly love it 
0,honestly feel really scammed plugged in these headphones into my ps and the sound quality was awful could only hear out of one side of the headphone and that was the microphone side honestly should not have been cheap on gaming headphones and paid for more expensive and high quality gaming accessories
1,works great
1,i love this little mouse it so small and sleek and fits in my hand nicely it moves quickly use several screens at work and it moves from to another without any problem and it fun that it lights up too 
0,the headphones work as headphones the mic is so poor though that it barely works no one can hear me unless yell now wasn expecting amazing mic quality but it simply does not work was on pc using the splitter it came with and then another splitter owned both work just not the headphones compete on my school esports team and these flopped during practice
0,has ear phone input option good sound quality long battery life
1,great for the price 
0,this product only lights up in red not multi colored as described or shown other than that that it okay 
0,it not very responsive but it does work the lights are terrible but it does light up as far as adjusting the dpi did not see difference at all would not recommend for gaming but if you wanna surf the web on smart tv its works well 
1,love this product works great for work it is nice it rechargeable and the charge lasts while 
0,lasts for few hours at close to max volume and obviously longer the lower the volume is great over all for the price but the back has an annoying clicking sound like the screws to panel are lose 
1,so can here it in any room want great buy
0,very slick 
1,ordered this for my son as typical headphones seem to not last long with him read other reviews on this gaming head set and decided to give it shot they came the very next day as advertised and the packaging well protected the product when giving them to my son his eyes lit up and he was very excited think he thinks we paid lot more than what we did for them the sound quality and microphone are great not sure about the noise canceling he normally leaves one ear uncovered to be able to hear his surroundings all in all great product fast delivery and very happy kid 
0,i bought this two weeks ago and it already does not work it is cheaply made and am very disappointed 
1,wish you could select the color of the rgb light it just cycles through all of them nothing in the instructions so it must only cycle besides that it nice super quiet click clicking the scroll wheel is loud and hard though 
0,i bought this in august and finally managed to get it to work after just few minutes of using it the the roller to scroll stopped working you can feel when the spring gave way while was using not sure if it can be fixed
1,the clicks are nice and quiet the lights are pretty the battery lasts long time it very simple plug and play 
1,pretty good was hard to use at the beginning seemed like it didnt work it has sensitive spots but once you get used to it works just fine 
0,adorable little mouse however the darn thing will be on and won do anything know to click to wake it if it in sleep mode but half the time it won be asleep and have to click like times for it to start actually working unfortunately ll have to find another mouse because this has become an irritating inconvenience 
1,the sound quality is amazing not to mention the great design all around good headset 
1,amazing headphones for gaming great product recommend them 
1,light weight fits hand perfectly
0,ive had it for less then hours and its already broken like the product and they feel nice on my ears but it is problem that this happened and hopefully this wont happen as often
0,the mouse started off okay it worked like it should for few weeks but then the battery would not make it through my work day the charge lasted less each time until suddenly it stopped holding charge like other reviews state it stopped working literally days after the return window closed ll be buying name brand mouse now 
0,appearance is bit different than was expecting also doesn glide smoothly and quickly enough on the screen not sure why sending back after day of use swiched to my old bluetooth mouse within hours
1,so needed good quality wireless keyboard but was little unsure any would meet my standards as techie and have huge tv and distance to my couch where was going to play pc games from just wow this thing has the responsiveness of wired gaming keyboard feels great to handle and use it at nearly feet away to boot it actually better than some of my professional keyboards use at nearly the cost totally worth the buy and the battery lasts ridiculously long 
1,this is great little mouse it is small responsive and love the way the light changes colors my hand is more relaxed when using it than with my previous mouse have had no issues with it so far overall based upon my experience thus far this was good purchase and would buy it again 
1,great sound
1,i like that this mouse os sleek in design has long battery life and is easy to set up often forget to turn it off but that doesn matter because it goes into sleep mode to preserve battery the only concern my tablet has type so the converter is helpful the only thing that would change is that the converter doesn fit inside the mouse for storage so you have to be careful not to lose it if you detach it from the tablet 
1,loved the look and feel of this mouse but after only weeks of school the usb completely came apart when pulled it out of my son chromebook there was no impact or anything to cause this and the kiddo was quite upset that it broke because he loves the look of this mouse as well as how it feels in his hand 
1,it sooo pretty and very easy to use just as described online highly recommend love rose gold 
0,i bought this mouse thinking rechargeable was the way to do it worked well for about day tried to recharge it several times but would not hold any charge at all ve gone back to battery operated mouse 
1,this is the first day of use but the mouse looks nice got flat black like that there are no batteries charged quickly and super easy to start using its light and fits my small hand nicely the lights are nice as well and not annoying like that they can be turned off don plan on using the mouse for gaming so will not know how well it works for that sort of thing for me just basic computer work photoshop lightroom and think it will do nicely for those it seems quick and is working well even without mouse pad think it was for sure worth the price so far its nice basic mouse think 
1,my grandson loved them he uses them with his xbox game no issues at all they have worked just fine ty
1,i love my new keyboard like how it turns off when not in use and is wireless and does not need battery 
0,

1,great unit feels sturdy keys are soft and quiet and feel much better than my previous one thin logitech wireless bit disappointed that can change the led colors wanted to customize it and turns out rainbow is the only option 
0,accent lights make it easy to find after days the scrolling wheel failed not good buy 
0,took on camping trip boat trip and had no issues 
0,actually one helluva speaker not too loud but don want to lose my ears so like it 
0,it basic sleep mode is irritating 
1,happy with product good price only down side it that am on my rd pair in years
1,this is an amazing sounding speaker it has good base but not overpowering the sound is clear and deep it is mono speaker but can be paired with second one for stereo use it at work and am rarely able to go past half way at full volume with an iphone not sure if it matters it never distorts or sounds scratchy 
1,purchased for my gaming teenager he loves it 
1,battery lasts long time once you connect it by bluetooth it connects automatically after sounds great even outside 
0,the button don work do not buy this keyboard very cheap like it need to be keyboard 
1,love the product bought for my microsoft surface pro and it works perfectly
0,good enough for the price but very awkward to handle middle mouse button is hard to push and often doesn actually get pushed despite making the sound 
1,good keyboard has nice touch and brightness 
1,i like the change in color but this is definitely not gaming mouse needed an alternative to keep me in the works so chose something that was cheap and nice looking its silent and has nice speed to it not too much sensitivity 
0,we tried several different ways to charge it and it would not hold charge over minutes 
1,if you re touch typist expect to be slowed down and make lot of mistakes because the enter key is much further to the right than any other keyboard ve ever used because of this this keyboard is very uncomfortable to use the keys resist bit but bounce back slowly it very easy for fast typist to get letters out of order because they keyboard just isn responsive enough don see how anyone would accept this as gaming keyboard 
1,great product my boyfriend loves it 
0,from what read this would plug into an android tablet have so that could control without using the touch screen but the adaptor did not allow this my mistake probably 
0,it broke after having it for months it was nice when first got it but no one could hear me when talked into the mic 
1,beautiful fast shipping
1,i love the sound quality as am using it for school also enjoyed how well the microphone worked too love the lights and feel like am in the zone whenever use it 
1,the sound quality is great and it just plain fun 
1,works great the cord is longer than would have liked also not fan that the lights need usb port
0,randomly stopped working during my work day the keyboard still lights up when you type but it like my computer stopped recognizing it even after plugged it in tried different things found on the web to troubleshoot but still can type when went online saw many many posts of users experiencing the same issue so based on that would not recommend buying this 
0,exactly what was looking for but get longer micro usb to usb charging cable the one it comes with is only about inches long just long enough to charge off your laptop 
1,awesome
0,product didn work
0,i ordered my first mouse it broke in two weeks returned reordered this one broke just few days after the return window closed don waste your money 
0,the lights on the side of the mouse are not as bright as thought they would be but still like the mouse none the less quiet clicking charges quickly 
1,this was good mouse got as gift and really liked it until it didn work anymore after while it stoped working and looked at some other reviews that said they got defective one well guess did and they are kinda common to be defective so would only risk buying it if you want the mouse decent amount would say you re chance of it being broken is like also it only stops working after like days so you won know until then if you buy it also did like that they added usb adapter in the box use they adapter for something else now 
1,its super simple easy and fast to use if you want something wireless that good full sized keyboard but simply don have the budget to pay for the more expensive ones then this is the keyboard for you 
0,worked fine at first about month in and now it gets glitchy for no reason flat design makes for poor support of hand not for gaming 
0,low end performance not as comfortable as expected 
1,i purchased this keyboard for use with my gaming machine using it upon my lap in chair with arm rests it doesn fit within the boundaries of the arm rests which causes me to be partially rotated to the left to even try and use it wish the keys were more centrally located for my back sake great backlight which dealuminates after use keys are bit clunky an overreach for that satisfying tactile response producing labored finger extension while using wish they would send me one without the number pad as not to interrupt the use of my main machine which use hours every day 
1,so far it seems to be working well hard to connect with the blue tooth have to fuss wish the base was better it ok but would like more 
0, at this point call this false advertising bought this to use on discord unless you have room for feet of cable and want to have that garbled my mike will never work sound quality don bother buying this piece of junk not to mention there are just so many things to plug in it cheaply made and get something better at dollar general waste of time 
0,worked fine the first few days then got problem where disgusting sound came out of the speaker 
0,junk
0,it got keys
1, love the fact that this thing is quiet as mouse lol hate the clicking sound on other mouses the other thing love is that it rechargeable no batteries the only con could find is that it is not an ergonomic mouse that the only reason why gave it stars 
1,works as intended the lights are pretty but bit bright use it from across the room with no issues and the battery life has been excellent even with me forgetting to turn it off 
1, goes perfect with my set up 
1,attached it to my bike for ragbrai works great like that its waterproof has long battery life charges my phone if needed and syncs with other jbl speakers within typical ft bluetooth range it gets pretty loud when you want it to but note that it only has one speaker so its mono not stereo sound unless you pair up two of them 
0,very good
1,i had this model on hold for long while as searched for the best all around speaker for my year old sons bday this thing is awesome sound is crisp and clear and no vibration or sound distortion at the highest level from rap to reggaton this speaker is awesome jbl is an old brand and still putting out great product even the color design is solid without peeling have two more on my list for christmas for my other son and my husband definitely recommend buying the case this does come with usb type cord but no charging block to plug into the wall this is also charger and has an on off button volume is controlled by bluetooth on smart phone instant change between songs without skipping or hesitation make sure you look all yhrough the box so you don accidentally throw the cord out 
1,easy to set up and it definitely quite 
0,i use this with my macbook pro and its good eye catcher when djing 
0,speaker works as advertised
1,horrible the first keyboard that got had dysfunctional key they did do good job of replacing it however the battery ran out and then the charger didn work as it happened ups didn do good job of picking up the old keyboard so still had that charger neither charger worked awful so much for their qa process that the company speaks so highly of

0,a little bulky but like it 
0,this mouse is not bluetooth compatible usb only
1,works like charm
1,i ve actually purchased two of these and both broke in the same way the scroller do not recommend if you need them for any kind of gaming that requires the scroller need to use it for camera angles in game and without it gameplay is awful won be buying third one but if that not gonna be problem for you then these will probably be great they hold charge well and the light show they put on is really cool 
0,really liked it at first especially since it charges and doesn need battery but the courser jumps everywhere have accidentally closed out my browser and all my tabs several times once during meet with my boss where was presenting of course now that have definitely decided this mouse sucks and want to return it the window is closed don buy this mouse

0,this item came broken we tried charging it over night but it never worked had to return it
1,not sure what to say that others haven already really great product rarely do ever get chance to turn the volume up to full it too loud for conversation even in large room 
0,i haven used it lot but the mouse will no longer scroll the mouse is also not very comfortable 
0,its cute and comfortable but tracks too slowly for gaming
1,solid speaker and sounds fantastic but doesn sound all that far off from the great sound of its predecessor only upgraded only because had thought the sound would be improved by considerable margin waterproof feature was also big reason why needed one as this sounds incredible in pool scenarios asides form that not upset that bought this speaker 
0,can barely hear in game audio at full volume not worth the money van get better quality from the walmart turtle beaches pass on this one 
1,its so cute slim and pretty 
1,this speaker sounds great and has an awesome battery life haven tested the water proofing yet but so far love this speaker
0,cheap and awful product
0,pros surprisingly the battery charge lasts me looooong time think it lasted me month on one charge one of the cheapest in the market cons the first one got didn work the replacement one worked but sometimes the scroll is backwards 
0,broke after no more than minutes of use something on the inside disconnected and the scrawling wheel spins freely not only it was waste of money actually needed compact mouse for my portable office forgot all about it in my trip now it is too late to return it you get what you pay for 
0,the sound quality both playback and recording is fine however find the earmuff portion of the headset to be bit too small as it does not fit around my entire ear and don have particularly large ears afaik this probably wouldn be huge issue for most people but if you have earrings it might be bit uncomfortable 
0,it would be better if you had setting that made the lights stay on all the time
1,this is one of the best speakers ve ever bought it has great sound quality easy bluetooth connectivity and has great battery life 
0,i really liked the mouse but it broke after few months it does not follow my commands eg copy and paste

1,omg this is literally one of the best mouse ve used in quite while previously was using small hp mouse and it gave me hand cramps over time however since switching this mouse has revived my fingertips to give me better mobility as complete my college assignments or even surf the web 
0,starting using on april and when came back to my desk yesterday it had completely stopped working can not charge it tried on multiple computers and the computers won acknowledge it if it not plugged in directly which defeats the purpose of the wireless chargeable mouse don buy if you are looking for long term option and can find way to contact the company the only option amazon gives me is to leave review can not contact the seller

0,where to start purchased this to use at an upcoming bbq pool party we were having with approximately guest when it first arrived fully charged it no wall charger included connected to bluetooth it was working fine for the short time used it the day of our party it would play for short time and stop but was showing it was connected to bluetooth it was very frustrating having to stop what we were doing to try to figure out the cause never figured it out the sound quality was subpar lacked in bass and at times distorted the overall sound was mono not what you would expect for the price and an upgraded model also you will not receive any of your phone notifications when using the speaker so you need to keep your phone with you we ended up having to use an old bose speaker so our guest would have continuous music without the constant interruption would not recommend the charge couple of our friends own the charge and it sounds and preforms much better than the returned
0,stopped working after week 
1,got this for me and my boyfriend he really likes them and like them as well they are very loud kinda hurts my ears and mic quality is also great definitely recommend
1,the sound quality of this headset is amazing plugged it in to my pc and there is no crackling noises and when talk friends and family there is no change or crackling in my voice 
0,she uses them every day for her xbox and on her chromebook
1,my son likes the headphones he said they are really comfortable and works with his laptop and game 
1,i use this keyboard for my ps as play mostly at night and needed quieter way to play online with people this does just the trick and is just more comfortable and quicker for me to type on than those tiny keyboard attachments for controllers my only small complaint as others have mentioned is some colored keys are easier to see than others but overall it hasn been significant issue and serves its purpose 
1, keep it plugged in and also connected the usb to my laptop but not sure if have to charge all the time lol it doesn bother me but love this mouse 
1,great sound and holds charge for long time like that we can connect to other jbl speakers
1,the price on this headset was unbeatable have had them for months and can believe how good they sound especially for the price point and they have held up with nothing breaking they are very comfortable and have had several hour gaming sessions with no complaints they don sound as good as the sony bluetooth set have but they were more expensive so didn expect them to the led lights are cool but fortunately you can not use them by not plugging in the usb connection if you are looking for comfortable decent sounding wired headset for great price look no further 
1,this mouse was purchased for use with my laptop ve purchased two of the same brand previously but wanted something different so took chance on this unknown the mouse is light and ergonomic have fairly small hand and it fits well connection was simple the sleep mode will definitely increase battery life add to this the pretty lights and lovely rose color pleasantly surprised would recommend this mouse to anyone who wants an inexpensive and uncomplicated addition to their setup 
0,regular use
1,great keyboard easy to use in the dark but wish it has screen light option to turn down or up the screen brightness but it just has the brightness of the keyboard the battery last like days no indicator to tell you it dying it just shuts off but it does tell you its charging yay pgot to get used to the ergonomic like all things 
0,i bought one of these and liked it so much that got one for both of my daughters also 
1,great item second time purchasing after full year 
0,do not buy the product does not work for intended purposes using as mouse for my computer it lights up and thats it can leave zero stars would if could 
1,got this keyboard as replacement for previous wireless keyboard liked the multi colored backlight functionality however what do not like is that the lights turn off after about seconds of no use wanted this keyboard to stay lit up but it just doesn do that still works and functions like good keyboard just hoped that the lights would stay on longer 
0,it does not recharge
1,bought in february and it worked great until rd or th charge now it not connecting to my computer any longer

0,no issues love the color works great for discord 
1,works like it should if your looking for good headset for the price this is it you wont get the beats by dre experience but not bad over all 
0,works well
1,works and the battery lasts week or two with frequent use and charges easily one less cord to get snarled in my laptop case too the lights around the edge seem silly but do make it easy to keep track of it in the dark goes to sleep after few minutes of nonuse requires mouse click to wake it up nuisance but that means you need not bother to turn it off overall very pleased 
1,great set
0,decent speaker for its size but not recommended for larger rooms 
0,this sister last uses
1,dig it love it still can adjust my fingers so that not pressing the key when want to hit enter because my hands are trained on wider keyboard oop did it again 
0,the mouse broke couple days after the return window reached out and heard nothing back not fun throwing money away like that 
1,it is super comfy and love the lights around it small enough for my hands highly recommend this mouse 
0,very quiet nice lighting
0,it doesn stay charged and it feels too light weight in your hand 
0,real like this mouse it stays charged for long time 
0,great product but bring charger the battery only really lasts for or so hours
0,the extensions are not quite long enough and they are little tight 
1, it an excellent product if you re looking for wireless mouse good price and with high load durability that correct use it for work in arcgis excellent service
0,dies way too quickly the product itself is so light and feels cheaply constructed wish could have returned it 
1,my mouse no matter how charged it is loves to just randomly jump to the side of my screen it been like this since first plugged it in besides that it pretty and like how the lights combined it also really helped me with my carpal tunnel issues 
1,they work as they should my son says the are good so that means they are great for gamers in teenage talk 
0,it quit working after days and they wouldn take it back or refund 
0,this is an awesome keyboard but what triggered my purchase was that thought it was water proof not sure how got that idea think some reviews had read were making mistake of saying water proof and not water resistant had also read reviews on another site that mentioned silicon sealed internals and the keyboard has quite few holes in it they are very well engineered for liquid to run onto and through the keyboard drying it very quickly have inquisitive pet birds that knock stuff over all the time onto my keyboards and are also fascinatd with stomping around on the keys seems to be weird fascination with most larger birds have seen so the idea of keyboard could just wash in the sink was awesome except that it isn have ran into few other people that have made the same assumption and instant destruction of an awesome keyboard as myself woulodn even really call it water resistant the board the battery wires and well everything is jsimply placed inside with no covering or anything while the drainage heoles do help mitigate spill damage the internal components seem very ill quiped for moisture of any typ my keyboard died quite instantly upon wiping it down with damp rag bit on the wet side though rung out quite bit so be careful this was selling point that somehow got very confusing which failed upon light testing of the water resistance 
1,i am fan on jelly bean type of mouse had previous jelly bean mouse that ended up giving to family member and was searching for another one to replace it and came across this one the lights is the one that did the trick for me here just love the lights other than that its nice light mouse could have been little shorter its longer mouse compared to my previous one but other than that very functional and light and can be carried in the pockets to meetings in offices which is what do primarily with this one 
1,awesome 
1,i am year old woman with small head have hard time even finding retail hats that fit me so have horrible time finding any kind of headphones that fit and or are not painful only just got these and on the smallest setting they mostly fit could honestly have them just little smaller and be perfect but at least these are not squeezing my head like vice as so many do the ear pieces go all the way around my ears so they are also not squeezing my ears which is painful think they will be ok for long periods of use because they do not hurt the sound quality seems fine hearing surround sound in my game as type this my voice comes out clear as does those am chatting with it easy to mute myself as well and change the volume right from the headset over all think these are really good quality and great price the lights are pretty although doubt will bother using them since do not stream and only have two usb ports on my laptop anyway 
0,it beautiful mouse with the color change but not happy that ve only had it few months and it no longer works at all don care for the usb adapter charging port because want to use old fashioned batteries sometimes to see if it would work but can because there is no battery slot 
1,used this for work and it perfect quick and responsive cute appearance and very light battery life last good amount of time before requiring charge love the lights 
0,used like times before it died don understand the reviews horrible product save your money
1,this wireless mouse works great and is easy to set up the led lights gives it nice look and the click is silent the battery last day haven had to change them over all mouse

0,amazing feels cheap but is very durable
1,great product works as advertised light and cool colors 
1,my first portable speaker love how long the battery can for for it can charge my phone from at least time only wish it was louder for the size
0,as described
0,this is very nice product the mouse does not need pad can work on the bare desk on sheet of paper etc my device does not have multiple leds only red or the software use does not employ all its features but there is no need to complain will buy again without hesitation 
0,it simple yet sleek looking mouse ve been using it for almost month and have no concerns about it recommend it 
0,it cute
1,sound quality is pretty good and the mic feels sturdy we ve used them for about months now and still going strong 
1,i probably should have known but the light is either red or it cycles through colors this is probably cool for gamers or middle school kids would rather be able to pick color but that is not feature available which is probably something should have expected but was being hopeful 
1,so far so good everything works speakers and microphone very happy with the purchase 
0,looks cool doesn last 
0,feels high quality and arrived quickly fits small head on the smallest setting which was concern when ordering 
0,cheap and doesn work

1,i love this mouse 
0,this was delivered less than weeks ago it barely been used and is already broken cannot right click at all would not recommend this product at all 
0,after using friend for so long just had to get my own 
1,and she loved it
0,pretty but dies quick even with new batteries we returned it
1,this is great keyboard except for the fact that the enter key is not wide enough the backslash key takes the place of where the first bit of the enter key should go will probably end up returning because don want to relearn how to type to make up for smaller enter key 
0,used this mouse for week and the scroll roller is already broken 
0,i wanted to get wireless backlit keyboard for my home pc something could use throughout my office without having to be directly next to my computer this keyboard looks great the keys themselves have nice travel for easy typing and the charge lasts for very long period of time but the lack of an always on feature for the backlit is very annoying understand it always being on would kill the battery quickly but this is rechargeable keyboard so losing some time to have to charge isn big deal for me it just feels odd that they wouldn just add an always on function for those who would want that often reviewing other peoples work or just reading through instructions so often don type for seconds at time so the lights are constantly going off again understand the reason and it not huge problem but it just feels like it would have been so easy to have an always on function added overall good keyboard but unfortunately for me it just not good fit for how use my keyboard 
1,this is really good bang for your buck you are getting what your paying for then more the keys are little ristricting for complex games crafting survival inventory management but for fps and others it is really great even with those more complex games it works when use it and hour or two day it last for about days don even turn the power switch off it sleeps really efficiently over all well rounded keyboard 
0,it looks good feels good but just works poorly did not track smoothly at all and more times than not trying to get the pointer to stop having little seizure on the screen tried with and without pad under it 
0,smol
1,the have great sound and work what need them for also the shipping was quick

1,very cool keyboard it easy to the eye at night when using would recommend this item to friends family and anyone else interested 
1,with the price was skeptical but this mouse really does work well as soon as plugged in the usb it took all of second before could start using it the clicks are smooth and quiet and it feels great ergonomically the lights also look really good highly recommend it 
0,great mouse overall but the middle click button needs lot of pressure to click which is quite annoy other than that would have given it star 
0,cool product for kid if the scrolling wheel in middle doesn keep breaking 
0,the microphone stopped working after the th day sent them back and bought another brand 
1,stopped working very disappointed was enjoying using the mouse working from home and only used for that purpose charged every days very disappointed the lifespan was short review update on product very happy with the customer service they reached out and provided refund customer service goes long way when you receive services or products having great customer service make you more confident in the company due to nothing is perfect

1,small enough to be portable big enough to provide great sound
0,it good
0,good enough keyboard really regret getting it though as have to charge it every week so it would have been better for me to have just gotten wired keyboard or one that takes batteries 
0,this thing works great if you keep it plugged in my speaker has sat on the charger for over week now and is less than half charged think got lemon my brother has this same speaker and his charges full overnight

1,love it 
1,the mouse worked well for day but nowhere cursor is non responsive checked to make sure it was fully charged did some troubleshooting and moved the usb to multiple ports on the laptop nothing worked guessing just received dud or maybe the mouse just isn compatible with my laptop ve used multiple wireless mouses with this laptop this is the first time ve ever had an issue make sure you try the mouse out right away after charging upon receiving it incase it doesn work and needs to be returned 
0,had it for one month and not working 
1,beautiful
1,great christmas gift
0,i like the design however the charge does not last long 
0,sleep mode
1,i was debating between the jbl charge and different version of the jbl and so glad went with this one the sounds quality is amazing and it came packaged so nicely jbl speakers on amazon go on sale frequently so add it to your cart and wait for the price to drop the quality is amazing and it so load for how small it is this one doesn come with case or carrier or anything but it is made out of such nice quality haven had any issues or scratches and ve just been throwing it in tote bag the charging port for your phone is so nice too and chargers relatively fast if you re debating between this one and pricier one would go with the charge 
1,love it 
0,everyone on line is telling me sound muted and ve never had that problem before as if the mic is covered but this set doesn have short so make do
1,so far so great no loud clicks and feels good in hand 
1,love the mouse my only downfall is that it very light and used to little heavier one so it something to get used too 
1,perfect mouse silently working
1,the speaker battery lasts literally forever and the sound quality is mind blowing honestly any speaker from jbl deserves the praise it gets 
0,its amazing bought it for my dad so he can see the keyboard but end up gaming on it instead
0,love the sleep mode keep my mouse charged when forget to turn it off 
1,i really like this mouse just wish had way to know what the battery was at or when it is getting low 
1,i bought when started to play more mouse keyboard games and didn want to be tethered to the computer it pretty has nice height with the little feet but is little glitchy sometimes it might be that the charge is running out but it puts itself to sleep the lights turn off and the keys don register in bursts and have to switch back to my wired keyboard the only fix is to plug it into the computer with cord that is shorter than my existing wired keyboard cord 
1,one day delivery was great well packaged and installed in no time 
1,its amazing
1,looks great comfortable in my hand
1,they are nice fit the only thing that could make them better if is the microphone could rotate to go both ways like to wear the mic on my right side 
1,so far great love the look and the sound is definitely recommend 
0,ok
1,i read lot of reviews across many sites as was trying to select portable bluetooth speaker for pool days in our back yard and also for our river camping trips the charge is waterproof so even better for our two primary uses was originally going to go with ultimate ears megaboom speaker until read about the jbl charge products and so glad did pretty particular about getting quality sound our of my home speakers computer speakers and headphones and very happy with what hear from the jbl charge for it size the sounds is amazing and very full with good bass but not overpoweringly so if you have an amazon echo of google smart speaker the sound from the charge blows those away the bluetooth syncing is super easy too if you ve ever had bluetooth syncing issues with other devices you know the irritation talking about that comes from that the charge sync to of our phones with ease definitely worth your consideration if you re looking for portable bluetooth speaker 
1,like it very much great price great performance and cute too 
1,my son loves the product has not had any issues the headset is clear 
0,have had this less than two months and it doesn work at all after hours of charging computer only recognizes clicks but no movement at all waste 
1,i liked how conveniently priced it was for good quality headset use it for gaming and streaming 
1,we bought these to replace my son headphones that the mute broke on within months he loves them and said the sound quality is great and they feel really comfortable very stylish and he ll look cool to all his friends and classmates with his light up headphones 
1,i ve had the same jbl speaker for almost years now and decided finally wanted to upgrade for better sound am so glad did the sound quality is lot better than had even thought it would be highly recommend this speak to anyone looking for something that portable with great sound
1,my grandson said it is very nice and is plenty loud enough he is happy with it 
1,my kid says they re pretty good microphone is great noise canceling could be better but overall really good headphones for the price 
1,works fine easy to install and use but there is nothing quiet about this keyboard it clacks along just like regular one not advertised as quiet 
1,very nice smooth feel fun led shifting color love the silent click feature 
1,grabbed this for my laptop so don have to mess with the trackpad for work after days of use it no longer holds charge not the fault of the charge port as switched it to different one to be sure the price is too good to be true 
1,this mouse is awesome it charges quickly and comes with an adapter for the new apple mac plug thing hated my other dell mouse and this one is so smooth quick to react and quiet never thought it would make difference but my students can not hear my annoying clicking anymore recommend 
1,i love this mouse it works well with my laptop it changes colors with music wasn expecting that but it is bonus it also changes color with the speakers purchased defiantly would recommend this product 
0,deep bass for small speaker also has great sounding highs too use it hours day at work and it doesn disappoint at all 
0,stopped working less than year after purchase the lights come on then immediately turn off after turning the keyboard on and they keys won work reseated the receiver and moved to different ports with no success charging doesn work 
0,mac book pro mouse never worked money refunded
1,bought this based on recommendation and would absolutely recommend it to everyone looking for great quality and portable bluetooth device
1,i have had the flip for year and can say one bad thing about this product the sound is amazing excellent bass you can turn up the speaker as loud as you want no distortion range is at least feet my laptop that is the source is inside near window unbelievable range have only run out of battery twice after hours of usage 
0,strictly gaming
0,these are ok when bought these thought it would be perfect to tune out outer noise it doesnt its good to hear for music if you play it others that are in your surroundings can hear just as much as you can phone calls can be heard thru these headphones might send back but really dont like
1,at first was happy with the product but now when try to click links have to press super hard to get it to work will probably return it 
0,felt cheap returned for better product
0,i really wanted to like this mouse as it lightweight and cute but it not worth it when the mouse charge dies quickly and since it not compatible with my macbook can use it while charging since have to use the same adapter for both sensor and charging also lights stopped changing colors and you can set to one color 
0,i really enjoyed this mouse at st due to my job but less than months of using it it has completely stopped working one of the girls work with owns similar mouse and when mine stopped working it actually worked with her laptop even though the mouse chip was plugged into my laptop 
1,just what expected better than most cheap under portable bluetooth speakers as far as sound quality goes its just ok honestly was hoping it had better sound quality but it doesnt but for portable battery powered bluetooth speakers it meets expectations for the price low frequencies bass is ok mid frequencies are ok and high frequencies treble are also just ok would have preferred they made it not waterproof and had better sound quality don really care if it waterproof or not especially if that feature is going to sacrifice the sound quality
1,the klim keyboard had good reviews so thought give it shot glad did ve been looking for deal on backlit keyboard but everything found was plus for gaming board really like this for the smaller frame yet having key included the multicolor backlighting is nice although the colors are fixed and only allow adjustment for pulse on or off and dimming don use keyboard for gaming much so really can comment on that the bottom line is if you are looking for an inexpensive keyboard that looks good has backlighting decent battery life and has smaller footprint for full size board then this is it 
1,great product 
1,grandson really liked this as it works fine
1,these compact portable speakers kick your ear buds love them great sounds
1,simple lightweight easy to use love the led lighting that flickers when in use so you know if it in sleep mode the top coat finish is terrible full of dust debris not smooth 
0,works just fine affordable price for decent gaming headset 
0,i was excited to try wireless keyboard and really thought would like this battery life would last about full day and half but it charged fast the lights made it easy to type at night which was also bonus typing with it was sort of annoying noisy but could have forgiven that if the product was actually decent after few weeks the typing just got completely laggy and every few keystrokes missed it became impossible to type on plugging it in with the charge wire didn fix the problem so switched back to my old wired keyboard waste of money for how fast this broke down 
1,i love this mouse very easy to use love the way the lights change color it just makes working brighter place
0,sometimes the keyboard will straight stop working then all your inputs pop in all at once more than minute later
0,i ve never used high quality headset but this one has been huge upgrade from using regular ear buds the downside is that the cable is heavy and constantly pulling on the headset it really needs clip to attach cable to your shirt 
1,so got them have an xbox series and the mic wasn working but now the sound on them rant working and idk what happening bc they work on my phone but not my xbox which don make sense they are really great quality but for me they re just not working
1,great headphones and they hold up well for how rough my kids are with them 
1,sound quality is amazing and as my wife can concur they most certainly are some of the best noise cancellation headphones ve ever used 
0,the speaker came charged but would never charge again thankful the initial charge lasted so long didn even notice it was defective until after the return window huge waste of money 
0,only issue was the ear hole are touch small but if you adjust enough they will cover them 
1,good product very nice
1,loved this mouse and the battery last pretty long
0,the sound is great and so are the look and feel the battery last long but not nearly as long as advertised 
0,the keys themselves are fairly quiet but the space bar appears to only be anchored in one spot so it clicks when you press it calling this keyboard silent is false advertising also have had the problem with using the left ctrl shift keys in keystroke sequence like when clearing cache or opening an incognito window which regularly need to do for work the right ctrl shift keystroke works though do like the battery life and the backlight but will be returning this and looking for something different 
0,the wheel for scrolling breaks to easily this is the second one that ve purchased with the same issue will try another brand 
1,i just purchased this headset because my old one crapped out on me can hear sounds fine but even at max volume it really quiet when tested the mic by doing short recording in audacity it was super quiet and sounded like was inside well covered by blanket when speaking at normal inside volume used different program to rectify this kind of the mic is now better volume but still sounds like crap guess it technically does what it supposed to but even for only thirty ish bucks this headset is not great probably just going to buy different one and keep this one as backup in case need it the only real pro of the headset is that it decently comfortable bottom line don recommend this thing ve spent less on better quality headsets before 
0,i was enjoying the mouse but after days it malfunctioned and the rotary portion did not work 
1,great value
0,my son used this daily for years before it broke age he immediately bought another great quality for the price 
0,it only lasted days is not worth returning it 
0,feels and looks cheaply made not to mention it broke in less then week 
1,great wireless mouse the instructions were easy to follow the only thing wish it did was glow red when it needs recharging will probably purchase another one when this one dies 
0,sadly no one said in the comments that the sound is piss poor and no one can hear you speak there no setting to adjust and oddly enough both connections are on the same cord returning these because have zero use for them spend little more money and get something of value 
0,even with the dongle in clear line of sight this keyboard constantly locks up in wireless mode don use it for gaming in fact don use it for anything 
0,lasted one day 
0,purchased this because of it can be recharged with any usb port no batteries required it is also compact with low profile it will be great for travel because it will take up very little space fits easily in pocket without bulging out 
1,the wireless connection works great and mouse looks sleek and cool especially for the price 
0,easy to use with sleek design 
0,already stopped working exactly after the return window closed 
1,well thought the product was great but expected it to be louder which it wasn don get me wrong it is pretty loud but just expected it to be more to the reviews ve seen they made it seem like you would physically have to lower the volume or else you would go deaf but don know 
1,great product couldn be happier with this purchase 
0,it been about months since bought this the piece that goes into your laptop to make it wireless completely fell apart and mouse no longer clicks would not recommend
1,love them 
1,upgraded from the the sound is lot more full the bass is definitely more powerful and bluetooth connects more quickly definitely worth the upgrade this is great speaker
0,worked until it needed to be charged after charging it worked sporadically and needed to be charged everyday need to be able to use my mouse everyday not wait for it to be charged 
0,purchased this keyboard for the office use back in may great keyboard quiet no delays battery lasted for about month at first then had to charge it every couple of weeks then every few days and now it died completely and cannot be used when plugged in very disappointed that it only last months 
1,awesome product excellent gift and they have many colors
0,you get what you pay for noted have to click this mouse at least three times to get it to do what want on any button on it it is so frustrating and find myself wishing would have spent more for quality product which may now have to do anyway bc im just so unhappy with it it is so cheaply made plastic all around wonder how this can justify price of over jmo others seem to like it it just was not what am looking for used it as replacement to my imac mouse circa which finally died miss the magic mouse but not worth lol im going to have to find happy medium this mouse doesn get it at all only redeeming factor is it is rechargeable 
0,can pair any device because the bluetooth button is not working 
1,the keys have an unusual silky feet that kinda like unexpected like the ability to see the keyboard in total darkness and love the colorfulness of it like the key selection and the ability to adjust volume even if the screen is off nice keyboard 
0,sounds good battery doesn last as long as advvertised 
1,update reorganized the living room and it seems that the wireless signal improved lot corners seem problematic for the dongle with good direct line of sight it works well really like the look and the fact that the enter key is large iso layout the key between and left shift is missing tho not sure whether it should be there anyway packing is nice and adds emotional value the usb charging cable is little too short the bad news is if it is not close enough to the dongle it fails lot after it goes to sleep it sometimes wakes up unresponsive you get key double presses and lost keystrokes randomly copying pasting and cutting can be chore because you don know if the keyboard sent the ctrl or ctrl appropriately if you figure out how to keep steady link between the keyboard and transmitter you re all good wish there was way to know how much battery is left if you re ok spending more on keyboard go for the pro stuff if you re on budget it good pick dear klim guys like you try improving connectivity for solid reliable wireless performance and showing battery usage
0,the wheel just spins and is not working anymore only days after purchased it returns are only within days can afford to buy new one every days so ll have to try different brand and seller 
0,bought two of these one for work and one for my personal computer in two different colors mouse worked great until the roller ball in each died one after couple months one after less than two days if you can live without the roller ball then highly recommend but if you use it heavily would look at different mouse 
0,compact and extremely loud when needed
1,works great don have to buy batteries plug it in and charge it 
1,great colors my son loves it easy to push keys great size 
0,wire is good length but sad that it only lights up when plugged in to computer by usb the headphones extension is short in my opinion have to pull down all the way and it just barely fits on my head overall for the money paid think got good deal
1,no complaints with this purchase slim design makes it easy to pack and go
1,great headset for the price

1,this mouse doesn work it may go few days of being ok but it doesn track properly and takes several minutes to start working then it ll go days without working at all charge it for hours at time so know that not the problem 
0,i ve been through two of these mice the first one lasted only one day before the scroll wheel stopped working opted for an exchange but the new one had the same issue after about weeks looking through reviews it seems to be common issue returning this for another brand 
0,product stinks
0,i bought one of these and in three months it completely stopped working couldn charge it or use it bought second one thinking the first one was bad one and the second one did the same thing buy something more reputable would not recommend buying this product 
1,i ordered this mouse really liked it it was slim fit nicely in my hand and loved how the lights changed colors after few months there was problem with it when the company found out they gladly refunded me my purchase price with no questions asked great customer service would order it again after dealing with them if hadn already bought another mouse because had work to finish give them stars
0,this product is awful
0,it has the charging cable but where is the plug for the outlet 
1,it cool mouse but don think it worth the price whenever use it my curser ocassionally jerks around the screen and makes it difficult to use it not my computer fault because switched mouses and the other one works fine also the color changing lights are see through from the top got white one and it kind of ruins the feel it just feels really cheap honestly though if it was maybe cheaper and it didn glitch the curser say it worth it like how you can charge it rather than switching out batteries and like how it comes with lightning usb adapter 
0,works very well
0,bought this mouse in march and today it stopped working it will not charge and is now useless 
1,the product is great love that can use it with both my computer and xbox the headset fits nicely on my head if you have bigger than average ears this might not be the right fit for you the headset is single plug and usb plug it did come with splitter for headphones and mic if needed it comfortable design and the cord is super long it has button on the the cord that allows you to mute the headset it also has volume control that gives better control instead of having to play with the sound setting on the computer or on the tv if you are using it for console gaming would recommend this to all my friends 
0,i really liked the color and look of the mouse but the scroll never worked even after fully charging it 
0,broke within week of having it

0,the wheel button broke as it was simply built with thin plastic rod sent it back hard pass

0,junk would not charge after days of use sticking to battery operated 
1,the headphones fit comfortably the headphones are not lout though even with everything turned up they aren as loud as they could be would recommend these for kids for that alone otherwise they aren bad as replacement for bucks they also can use usb or single port the wire is split and even comes with splitter for the single port total of different ways to hook it up it is made of cheap plastic so it might be for everyone but it not bad option if you need headset

0,we ride side by sides and sometimes it hard to hear the tunes not problem with the charge 
0,dissatisfied with purchase mouse works except for the scrolling wheel 
0,this speaker broke less than month after purchase normal medium volume usage only not pleased
0,sounds and looks great but in less than month the charging port melted and started smoking electrical malfunction of some sort 
0,the mic was not bendable and stopped working after week the sound quality was ok though
1,the jbl charge is great product found it to be initially disappointing due to the warm sound signature have found that the highs aren totally accurate but they re close enough to not distract you from the music the highs are present but definitely aren strong which adds to the warm signature the mids are very good and exceptionally clear for the size of this device because of this the vocals are great in most songs they are well represented unless they sneak up on the high notes which is when you can hear slight distortion from accuracy however the vocals which dip into lower range sound really good as the speaker does great job not to put too much emphasis on the radiators making it sound bassy and unrealistic if you listen to high quality hifi tracks you ll be able to imagine the singer right in front of you because of the presence and sound stage as for the mono speaker don listen to the critics of this new implementation because most of them either don know what they re talking about or they are just picking at it because they don like the thought of it you re not going to get stereo by using speakers inches apart like on the last model and as for separation this mono speaker separates just fine if not better than the last model especially in mid to lows the speaker gets plenty loud for the average person and it manages to maintain its dynamics all the way to just under full volume ve compared this speaker to many others such as charge xb xb xb extreme onyx and what ve found is that while the highs are bit lacking in certain songs it certainly makes up for it in other departments the bass is very good in the charge the bass notes are represented accurately and it able to hit lower frequencies most portable speakers of this size can however it worth mentioning it still no sub this speaker has trouble representing very low frequencies the radiators start shaking instead of making music which for those of you who don know this doesn sound very good the battery life of this speaker wasn as advertised and found could only get hours on percent volume which isn bad but is huge deviation from the claimed hours after using this speaker for awhile and comparing it to other speakers ve actually grown fond of this unit and it become my beach toy don take any critics in this review too seriously as doubt most people are as critical as me when it comes to audio but this one gets my thumbs up future improvements would definitely require tweeter and possibly bigger battery 
1,i got them for my son as birthday present so far he been really enjoying them he loves that they light up he thought it so cool 
0,i thought this headset worked great up until it constantly disconnected from the controller and have to position it over and over again it so annoying don even think abt buying this 
1,the product is genuinely pretty good decent sound quality and mic quality however the mute mic function on the wiring does not work had muted myself utilizing that function and everyone was still able to here me during meeting 
1,really comfortable great sound quality from both ends and it can be used for lot of devices 
0,just had mouse for months and it has stopped working 
0,i like it but bit uncomfortable need bigger ear cups 
1,i love this headset it very good for music and gaming even if it only seems to support standard sony controllers so couldn use my custom controller with it but it no big deal it still lets you hear things you just couldn use the mic since you didn come through but the sound quality was really good and crisp especially when it comes down to bass it was perfect tldr great as long as you have sony brand controller and nothing aftermarket 
1,these headphones are amazing and love them so much the noise cancelation is okay it works but its not as perfect as thought it would be they are comfortable but they do not connect to my android phone the headphones only light up when you plug them into the spot where plug in my mouse so was bit disappointed about that but other than that they are super comfortable and love them so much 
1,i absolutely love my mouse it good quality and last pretty long time before needing charge 
1,bought for my great grandson he loves them
0,i bought this because the keyboard on my daughter asus gaming laptop kept having problems with the keys popping off this is working well for now and she enjoys the light up feature 
1,i like that this mouse has rechargeable feature which makes it super lightweight and slim that makes super easy to carry color options are nice as well would definitely recommend this one 
0,mouse was advertised as quiet but it is far from quiet it has the loudest sound have ever heard from mouse when clicking the middle button disappointed in the clearly false advertising 
0,the wheel on this mouse if very flimsy it has failed on two of the devices ordered would not recommend this product it not even suitable for the lightest of duties 
0,its cool mouse till had to recharge it plugged in the cable that came with it and it started getting hot until saw smoke ripped it out almost burned my self regular phone charger works fine tho 
1,amazing speaker good price
1,this light up mouse is great and ve had few similar ones like that this one is rounded on the edges more aesthetically pleasing imo it holds charge for long enough that it not annoying though it would be nice if there was an option to turn the light off while using to save charge even more the options are just on constant red light or cycles through colors clicks are definitely as close to silent as you could get the only thing that is bothering me is that the wheel is squeaking after only weeks of use intend to drop some wd onto it and sure that will fix the problem but don think that should be necessary to begin with overall good choice though immediate update directing wd into the wheel well of the mouse is not easy even using pin dropped the mouse and now the wheel doesn scroll at all it just spins soooooo not great removing star either accept the squeaky wheel or be very careful when trying to oil said wheel because if you drop it it will die ugh
1,love the slimness of the mouse without loosing great functionality the re charge feature is great 
0,this product has been so far great didn encounter any problems with it 
0,i love the light weight fee to this mouse but unfortunately it doesn hold charge to be able to use it 
1,when ordered my keyboard for my boyfriend the charging piece wasn in the box so messaged customer service and they sent me new one within couple days once used the keyboard it was nice quality the keys were smooth and satisfying to press it connected very easily to the pc definitely if you want keyboard buy this

1,this is good set of headphones but if you use the microphone for gaming the majority of people say you sound like you are talking into tin can down hallway lol
0,after turn it off randomly turns on by itself 
0,nice
1,the mouse is very cute and love the colors and the way it lights up went to use it one day and it was out of charge charged it doubt this will last long it was but really worth about

0,the mouse is light weight and like the colors it is also smooth and charge lasts for while however just bought it in may and today in august the usb broke off in the usb port of my computer the metal part detached from the plastic part disappointed 
0,at first just loved the mouse and it was so pretty when turn on the lights but when it was time to recharge and it just never recharged and tried and tried for well over day its dead and only two weeks old so disappointed so will be purchasing another wireless mouse from another company instead simply not worth my time to fuss with returning etc 
1,love it 
1,i own of these now as purchased the second specifically because jbl advertises that you can link up to something like of these together to all play the same music wanted that for my backyard while this speaker sounds great on its own found the process of connecting it my original jbl speaker to be very challenging and it keeps cutting in and out very choppy 
0,this mouse was very dissapointing it was hard to use and finally after couple of months it broke completly

0,poor quality cheap breaks quickly doesn last long on full charge charging port already broke 
0,basically battery quit taking charge then had to mail it in to get another the turn around was quick 
0,good job
0,not only does this feel like the cheapest mouse have ever had the displeasure of holding the usb type adapter is loose fitting piece of junk not even worth the hassle of returning this piece of garbage only flashes red for second then quits doing anything else even after being charged for hours have attached it to different devices and nothing guess you get what you pay for and this instance junk

1,features are easy to use and keys are easy to see
1,this is over year old however used intermittently and recently continuously disconnects from multiple sources making it worthless to have to keep re setting every minutes and sometimes seconds our last jbl was amazing and had amazing sound for only years when power source broke we replaced power source and still working but should not have quit after years of occassional use great product too short of life span for products 
0,barely had it months and the scroll wheel on top stopped working now it pretty much useless 
0,i ve had this mouse for less than month and it already glitching out moving the curser without me moving the actual mouse cool colors though

0,overall liked the feel and responsiveness but the durability was the big issue this mouse was for work computer with light everyday use and within less than two months it would no longer charge or work properly took it apart to verify the battery was making connection and even replaced the battery however the mouse still would not track properly perhaps just got dud but decided to spend few more dollars and purchase different brand 
0,purchase as gift

0,bought this speaker for my dad who is an expert in car audio and he was impressed in the quality and volume this speaker has 
1,these are great very heavy duty very comfortable the volume is wonderful no static couldn be any more happy with my purchase love how they come with different attachments so they will fit any device that you use have spent on pair and these work the same if not better will recommend these to everyone know and we will never purchase headphones through anyone else ever again we are lifetimers 
0,loved at first but ve only used handful of times and the middle rolling part broke so can scroll 
0,really liked the look feel quiet click but it broke on me after few days 
1,can think of anything that don like about this unit sound is very good for it size easy to pack around too 
0,decent headphones for kid gaming nothing fancy but does the job 
1,everything arrived and performs great 
1,i do lots of sidejobs and needed something loud and clear for long hard hours and this blew my expectations it small loud and crisp clear love me some 
1,bought this because it was suggested for its comfort it said people with larger heads could wear it without the infamous head pinch was snug fit for me felt the pinch and the ear cups were too small was going to disregard it since it was fairly cheap but then tested it out one of the headphones didn work and yeah made sure it wasn on mono the the and were on and balanced returned 
1,my husband and purchased two of these speakers and are thrilled with them the sound quality is fantastic and when they say they are waterproof you can believe it we took one of our speakers out on the boat with us and wouldn you know it passing wake toppled it right into the water we had to turn the boat around to go grab out of the water and the speaker never lost sound nor suffered any damage whatsoever the entire time it was in the water about minutes it never stopped playing the song as it was floating although an unfortunate incident the speakers held up continue to operate and needless to say we highly recommend them 
1,this mouse was amazing when first got it and it worked amazing for the first few months then started having connecting issues so direct hooked it up to my pc and it worked like that for day now it doesnt work at all dont waste your money on this 
1,i knew what was getting myself into reading the bad reviews it stops working in few weeks usually hedge my bets especially when product has so many reviews that end up with star rating alas lost this bet the scroll function key feature look for in buying mice stopped responding after few weeks fluke should buy scratcher if so because bought two one white one black and they both failed around the same time wondering if this is actually engineered to perform this way though as seeing many other reviews doing the same thing but people being bribed for star if replaced quite genius actually if you get angry customers to review it promotes product engagement but then the rating can be manipulated by replacing the cheap product and soliciting star review if this indeed is the case bravo brilliant way to get as many positive reviews for subpar product 
1,for the price think it good value 
0,space bar and other keys were getting stuck and noisy 
0,i purchased this wireless mouse the first part of may it is now early july and it doesn work anymore have charged it and it still doesn work waste of money 
1,the mouse works great until it goes to sleep agggh then you have to shake tap hard against your palm so you don smash it to pieces or flip the switch back and forth it quite irritating if it was as simple as on and off it would be perfect 
0,sound quality is good bluetooth connection is as described and it will sync to other jbl devices 
1,worked great for about months stays charged for long time and like being able to use the port in my laptop however now the scroll button moves erratic scrolling down the page and the page jumps up go up and it jumps down 
1,this is user friendly works well and holds charge for long time would buy it again
0,i ve had this speaker for days under year and it won take charge anymore the sound was decent but don recommend that much money should buy batter that lasts longer either cheap parts or bad design 
1,i love this mouse for the most part the colors are vivid and it feels nice in my hand the only downside is that the right click has tendency to stick even when am only using the left click ve had it for few days now and that the only negative 
1,some of the reviews on how this mouse did not work after the first use caused me apprehension but given the price took the risk it is just what needed and it is really pretty as well great product 
0,at first this mouse was the best ever however whenever it touches table the bottom red light turns on and makes the colors look all messed up it was still very comfortable though however months later whenever turned it on it would start autoclicking and the only way to stop it is to remove the usb charger it great for the first months but then started failing me 
0,mouse completely died and wouldn charge in less than month no return policy
0,you get what you pay for this thing is piece of crap 
1,the mouse worked great for just over month then the charging port detached from the mouse yes came right out no longer have the ability to charge it this was probably glitch with my individual unit otherwise would have given it stars 
1,have been using the wireless mouse now for few months and it is great purchase after charging it works for days also the speed is fantastic would highly recommend buying item 
1,grandson loves it it is awesome love the colors not to bright 
1,i get so many compliments about this mouse move location to location for my job and it held up just fine quiet click smooth functionality fun color changing led love it the only negative is that the charging cord is short and doesn also operate the mouse when plugged in so make sure you have two usb plugs when needing charge 
0,the idea of this mouse sounded nice and fun however was very disappointed to see that the usb is slightly bigger than other usb cables and it did not fit into my laptop or any other usb port for that matter perhaps this one was defective but this was unacceptable would give zero stars if could 
0,doesn hold charge long

0,loved the product look and that it was rechargeable however the battery didn hold the charge long enough for the device to properly connect via bluetooth so you had to leave it plugged in which defeats the purpose of wireless mouse also the shape for the mouse provided little comfort as it caused my palm to cramp after two days of use returning item and going back to logitech brand

1,the mouse is really quiet no clicking sound which liked comfortable for the hand does not hold charge very long and nothing worse than not responding during middle of the work day had tried to different brands the other was one that had bluetooth feature so could use it on my tablet that held charge all week and will be getting another one of those 
0,looks so cheap didn even work properly 
1,really love the jbl speakers this is the fourth one we ve purchased you can link them together great for football tailgating too 
1, love the fact that this thing is quiet as mouse lol hate the clicking sound on other mouses the other thing love is that it rechargeable no batteries the only con could find is that it is not an ergonomic mouse that the only reason why gave it stars 
0,i love this mouse it very smooth if had one complaint it would be that it will be dead in the morning if you don plug it up before you leave work but sometimes just forget to plug it up when leave so that my fault 
0,doesn recharge and the arrow on my screen moves very choppy and jumps around so half the time can click on what want 
1,the design is nice but these headsets aren worth it it use to light up when plugged in and play sounds loudly when first got it but not anymore the sound has to much bass and staticky from the beginning the microphone would not work despite following the instructions to turn it on so just used it for work to hear notifications when stepped away my computer won recognize the headset anymore even when the lights are turned on just prop now 
0,only used it few times and like it 
1,great product
1,i ve had this for about year or two now and this thing is sick sound quality is amazing and couldn be happier didn want anything too small or too big and this is perfect for taking out and about it comes with sling but ve never used it before getting this speaker ve never owned jbl product and was somewhat apprehensive have the blue color because couldn find the green camo at some point like to get the next size up but for now this will work just fine ve seen jbl products range from and depending on what speaker it is would totally buy it because have fallen in love with the brand now bought this at my local best buy not on amazon 
0,nice color big and comfortable but doesn feel heavy only dislike is that the led lights don work unless you use the usb
0,stopped working after two or so months of having it 
0,it really good for gaming and how it cancels some of the noise outside 
0,worked great before it died after months of ownership 
0,i never write reviews as matter of fact this is the first have ever written but due to the danger factor felt compelled to my son plugged in his mouse this morning and walked away and within minute my husband smelled something burning and fortunately was able to get to it before the flames yes flames reached the drapes because the charging cable caught on fire 
1,very good quality for decent price will probably buy another as gift 
0,worked great until today scroll wheel no longer works this is not even an item use more than three times month disappointing 
0,just received this yesterday and plugged it in today have left it on the charger for longer than hours because every time it says it is charged can not use it longer than min before it goes dead like the look and feel of it but did not buy it to used plugged in very disappointed and will have to buy something different the box got thrown away so guess it can not be returned at this point will give it one more day to try before choosing something different like to hope that just got lemon 
0,good headphones for the price but really crappy switch the volume will cut out on one side when you roll up or down you have to fiddle with it lot the mute button is iffy at best 
0,first one died within week and half bit the company was great about getting me quick replacement
1,i love all the colors this mouse has keep on thru the nite last long time on one charge
1,i spend lot of time working with music esp mixing mastering composing wanted speaker could enjoy while was at the skatepark my friends something that could get loud and sound really good heard jbl was pretty popular and had good reputation but was dissappointed with the charge in terms of build quality it nice speaker it feels sturdy and looks good but as soon as turned on song was shocked by the quality of audio the mid frequencies were boosted and they made audio sound muddy and unpleasant for speaker that was real letdown checked out their app hoping for some sort of software update tune up but it very bare bones and didn have anything to help also checked if bass mode was on and it was from the start went into my phone eq settings and manually changed the spectrum to my liking if you own this speaker recommend you moderately raise the lows duck the mids and raise the highs that made the speaker lot more pleasant but as soon as did that it took loss on its max volume the skatepark go to is pretty small but has metal ramps that get loud this speaker wasn enough for the park it definitely okay if you re at small picnic in an apartment etc but it doesn get as loud as was hoping overall this speaker isn worth the price for an allegedly reputable brand it absurd the sound quality doesn come good from the start it felt like paid for jbl logo what think ll do is buy from cheaper brand and do the eq tuning myself hope this helps have good week 
0,stopped working after couple months 
0,the product description is correct and found nothing wrong with the headset it has both pin jack and usb connector on the end it did not work quickly on my pc did not do any problem solving because did not like the fit the pads are oval and not as soft as wanted wear glasses and so they pushed my ear around the glasses and were uncomfortable for me there was nothing wrong with them they just were not for me 
1,worked great very pretty aquamarine color easy you use precise and then suddenly died today stop charging so after few months it departed this world without sound not worth it wish it did going to order from another maker 
1,this keyboard matched the description and worked perfectly out of the box it runs on an internal battery that can be recharged from usb charging cable the colors look good and the lights are adjustable would recommend this item and buy it again 
1,the lights work but the keyboard is detected as mouse updated all driver software and their website support offers nothing the manual didn mention device manager isn leading to any solutions either give me my money back
1,functional and affordable they fit my son head nicely braided cable with volume and mute switch haven tested lights because he just needed something for school he says they re comfy and awesome 
0,don buy it it can hold charge it moves on it own and was way too expensive for how crappy it was

1,very nice and good quality headset the gaming experience and noise canceling and sound quality are amazing

1,this mouse is very comfortable and ergonomic it is also very silent the led lights are very calming love it recommended 
1,just got them today and love 
1,so it possible this is good device however the keyboard receiver combo received is triple malfunctioning it lags excessively between input and recognition tried all usb ports to confirm the sleep mode activates within seconds of disuse so even input tests are wonky and receiving range is maybe ft at best 
1,i never had wireless mouse before and wow blown away that the chord had been cut and free to have total control from such great distance great ergonomic design and also has lights that flash and can charge it with no more batteries love this mouse 
0,purchased for fourteen year old for gaming but it stopped working after less than month of use 
0,the mouse itself still works but the usb port has just broken in million pieces my laptop stays at home and it is what use as my home computer after about month of use the usb port is just the piece that pushes into the laptop and the plastic tip is just gone one more break and it will either be stuck in my computer or will be unable to use the mouse 
1,used these for gaming for my son quality is great 
0,dont buy stopped working after weeks

0,i purchased two jbl charge speakers one of them quit working within month do like the sound out of the smaller jbl charge better than the charge also the charge has microphone so you can use it as speakerphone the charge only has one speaker so it is not even stereo jbl is very difficult to work with they sent me charge claiming it was better than the charge for the replacement but it is not and you don even get charger to charge the battery on the charge if was to do it again believe would stay away from jbl 
1,i love this mouse it small and very quiet the led lights are plus got the pink one and it couldn be any cuter definitely will buy again need one at home and work

1,perfect for my year old for gaming 
0,the item would charge but then would not turn on or work at all in the computer
0,bought this for my year old it actually came with the double chord for pcs which my sons laptop didn need but know some others do need it so far it working fine 
0,was decent first month very flat so not ergonomic but that personal taste issue is this is already broken the scroll wheel no longer works even for mouse that pretty pathetic since ve had other mouses for years at time had the same issue as other reviews with the cursor randomly jumping too so there might be some design issue with the sensor 
1,idk if would say this is great mouse for gaming but it great for the price and very smooth different setting are great too flip the lights on and it like rave in your hand 
0,the mouse is comfortable to use with its very slim low profile its accuracy is normal or average to the regular computer user mine did not come with the type receiver assume it was sold once before and not checked to see if all parts were there before reselling the most annoying thing about the mouse is having to charge over and over again you have to remember to plug it in everyday for the user who is on the his or her computer lot there is no meter to check for how much battery is left and can be annoying when it starts being erratic because it needs juicing up it seems to go into sleep mode really quickly so you will have to click button to start moving again slight annoyance not bad mouse for the price but the annoying things about it have me going back to replaceable battery ones that am used to using the colors are nice and pretty but you get over that really quick 
0,very ergonomic soft click like that it recharges and doesn need batteries can plug it in overnight if need to but the charge lasts long time it is comfy
0,i had my mouse for about week and after using it maybe times it completely stopped moving around only things that works on it is the buttons and the wheel
0,not bad as expected for the price clicks little loud when you click use it 
1,i love the color and the light the most it so easy to use and the best part is not having to download drivers 
1,so far so good great sound quality with some bass too 
1,these headphones are very high quality for low price very sturdy and don feel cheap they hold onto your head very snug and don slip like alot of other headsets the sound quality is better than some high end headsets ve used and they cancel noise outside of the headset very well the cord is also very long so you re not restricted on how much you can move with them on as it is wired headset 
1, just live my cordless keyboard and mouse they match my hp desktop computer perfectly 
0,just got it seems fine
0,the scroll wheel stopped working after month very frustrated 
1,i literally dropped this speaker in the lake and it still works perfectly battery life is awesome and the sound quality is amazing take this speaker everywhere go highly recommend 
0,despite the description saying it was macbook compatible it wasn have the macbook air with the chip regardless it nice mouse and it quite as described and does work on pc was able to test it on my pc

0,the mic volume is bit low even on high 
1,i have only had this few days but so far is been good haven had any connectivity issues the space bar is rather loud for the keyboard being silent it the only key though over all great product for the price would recommend to friends or family 
1,this head feels good and not all bad nut my one problem is that the mic not working for some reason it just won work tried it on all my devices and it just won work 
1,mic works well and the set is great for gaming it has good sound volume but not too loud
1,i don normally like using mouse when am on my laptop but they built in keys on my laptop were starting to go so decided to purchase mouse when looking for mouse wanted something sleek and able to take with me to school and back it fits my hand perfectly and enjoy how sleek it looks the only thing that would change is being able to decide the color and color patterns other than that it was worth the purchase 
0,so far so good although my first impression is that putting the on off switch underneath is stupid lights going off after minute is problematic in the dark unless you really know your touch typing fn pause lights high low or offif reviews are accurate now ll wait to see if got one that lasts 
1,love the cordlessmess best ve seen thanks
0,letters needs to be bolder not bright enough
0,mouse would not charge after initial charge only got one days use out of it
1,this speaker is what you would need if you want something thats loud but has great bass even on low volume this speaker has incredible bass the sound at just of the volume sounds really loud the battery life is as it promises in my experience played from of battery at percent of volume for up to days until it died

1,very chic and love the way it lights up it has two settings either leave the lights totally on or have them cut on as you tap on the buttons works wonderful and have only had to charge it one time since ve had the mouse 
0,i bought this to replace another that had used from august to december replaced the first one due to the spinner breaking was hoping that the new one would last longer but it only lasted weeks completely disappointed in it 
0,i use this for my xbox partychat never had issue in the past and ve gotten the same one from the same person but the one got recently seems to be little staticky so it constantly in your ears and in somebody else ears other than that they re okay just static gaming
1,great product for the price my daughter loves it it is so quiet when you re clicking the buttons that you can hear it at all so have decided to purchase myself one as well

0,it cute pink is just like the picture it really nice mouse but sad that it doesn work with my ipad put photos of the manual and it says that mouse needs usb port to operate think that black usb goes into computer and communicates with the one beneath the mouse 
0,i used this mouse for work as am hybrid worker and do most work in the field or different workspaces when the mouse leaves my home office to go with me it has its own individual protective padded case in my work bag worked great until it just stopped working which is very disappointing after almost months the mouse still lights up looks like it works took charge from the charger but will not move on the screen in my work computer thinkpad or personal computer macbook that said either the mouse internally stopped working in some aspect or the usb dongle is defective per my it consultant tried all possible usb ports even those on my apple magic keyboard and still does not move on the screen also tried every idea could find to reset repair the issue in line to no avail it is disappointing and huge inconvenience this happened you would expect product to last more than months for my coworkers that asked about my mouse as they thought it was cool they will now be told it died only after short period of time and cautioned if they decide to buy one have yet to hear back from their customer service and not sure ever will maybe it is true after all you get what you pay for now need to buy another new mouse which was something hoped to not have to worry about for long time please keep in mind do not leave this review to bash the company this review is to let people know my experience with the mouse like said it worked great until it just stopped working still lights up just will not move on my screen for no apparent reason as it work the night before buyer beware

1,i got these for my husband to use on zoom while he works from home he loves that he can hear our kids in the background and that he hears the people he talking with very clearly he says he is made fun of daily though for the size of these headphones his clients and colleagues constantly ask him if he become gamer they also crack jokes about him being an air traffic controller ve offered to find him new headphones but he has declined he takes the poking fun in stride and sees it as an icebreaker for his work sessions with his clients and colleagues overall great purchase wish had gotten them for him year ago when he first started working from home

1,i don use it for gaming that why give it three stars for that haven used sleep mode and don plan on it so gave it three stars not using that either the three stars for ergonomics is accurate because it could be little bit taller and we both have tiny hands will be small for someone with large hands for sure the colors are nice price is right oh and we like how it changes colors would buy again adapter that comes with are very convenient and worth the money paid just for the adapters

0,nice quality feel great under my fingers but brightnes not the best
0,the mouse works fine it is slim kind of cheap plastic but the lights which in photos look like it would just be thin line around the mouse are very annoying the entire thing lights up you can not turn them off and still use the mouse it is very distracting did not try to return it because there is nothing else wrong but will donate it to charity or someone ordered another one with no lights

0,i got the mouse but the charging cable sent was type charging cable so it wont fit into the mouse to charge 
1,best speaker ve ever put money into that worth it 
1,i have really enjoyed the sound quality of this bluetooth device it is small and portable but sturdy love the box it came in to keep it protected and easy to store 
1,i use this headset for my ps and the microphone doesn work unfortunately my friends can barely hear my voice if not at all ve noticed the sound quality is very low as well even in high volume it doesn light up unless plugged into computer and when plugged into my laptop it doesn connect pray it ll get better soon

0,basicmisleading nothing special random usish logo offensive marketing per far too often 
0,we take it every where beach camping bbqs
0,i use this product for customer service 
1,super awesome looking mouse however stopped working about month into having it not an ideal purchase 
0,grandson say they work good
0,love this mouse overall beautiful lights fits well in hand responsive but wheel broke after less than one month of regular use for design work very sad this is the second mouse ve bought first lasted months same issue because like it so much unfortunately will be looking for something different for my next mouse 
1,i really like that it comes with usb adapter saved my life because the new macbooks aren compatible with usb over all really nice mouse fits in my hand perfectly and love the lights on it 
1,i would have loved this product if my hands weren so picky and plus it was bit too flat for gaming on pc works fine very silent clicks still if you aren used to flat mouse don buy it
1,not as loud as wanted but still great buy and came with adapter will probably like it more with more use 
0,quiet precise 
1,i love the ruggedness of this speaker its punchiness and especially the fact that you can link together devices however you must upgrade the firmware to version it easy to do with the app do it when first got this device the sound quality was awful on low volumes it was like there was some kind of gating effect enabled that ate quiet sounds what worse when held it up to my eat could still hear digital noise from the bluetooth connection at low volumes it gave kind crackling effect yikes as last resort tried upgrading the firmware wasn too hopeful because the changelog said fixes minor bugs lol well it turns out that it fixed the low volume gating effect which consider to be major blocker like to listen to quiet music at night so this was huge relief whew i
1,awesome speaker the base is great 
0,good
1,i not the greatest at typing numbers thought this would be good night time solution to see the number buttons but the light is too dim as well as the numbers printed too small on the keyboard found the battery life lacking as well 
0,quit working after month not worth the money paid 
0,battery goes dead quickly and not as loud as other brands with same size 
1,i have small hands and it feels great on it it light and pretty live that it changes colors haven used it for gaming though 
1,sound quality is amazing use it for work loud enough where can hear over the loud equipment and last all day highly recommend this device
0,i am so angry now the battery life was short had to charge very short time after first use it was out of battery again today so changed it it worked for about minutes after charged then stopped responding tried all usb ports of my laptop all working so it the keyboard tried wireless or wired doesn work it just doesn work 
1,when in doubt always look at the most recent reviews rather than most popular really wanted to like this keyboard it started off fine but then the battery would hold its charge less and less within month of owning it it needed to be plugged into the usb charger all of the time or else it would immediately lose its charge and turn off so now have functionally wired keyboard after trying to buy wireless one speaking of function the numpad keys do not work and the usb charging cable is ridiculously short have to use an extension cord just to use it on my standing desk the usb cable must be special because none of the other usb cables own work with it macbook oculus jabra even cable that specifically said it would work with this keyboard the rgb was one of the main reasons why bought this keyboard but it leaves lot to be desired it not that bright and isn dynamic when typing save your money unless you really want to spend for paper weight 
0,stops working even when it fully charged 
1,it light and lights up so nifty
0,this is not compatible with hp or google chrome devices 
0,came fast no set up required just plug in and go the kids in my classroom love the light up feature

1,this was christmas gift and the recipient was thrilled to death when gift was opened was given demonstration soon after gift was opened looked great with the changing colors of the device 
1,i love the keyboard just wish there was switch to keep the lights on while using it but actually understand that it would require it to be charged more so either way love the freaking keyboard it made my work life little more simplified 
0,sleek and easy to use and fast charging
1,i ordered this after my very old hp wireless keyboard decided to tap out on me with few of the keys just no longer working at all since my family member didn want to spend the on can of compressed air to fix it so tried few ways to see if it could be fixed trying few other tips on my own as it was bit grimy dirty but unfortunately for whatever reason the keys still wouldn work so figured why not purchase brand new one after searching on amazon my eyes were immediately drawn to this one to be honest so far am really liking this keyboard especially the colored lighting when it hits nighttime talk about really nifty idea so far love it the one downside have with this keyboard though is the fact that it has to be charged using charger to connectto my wireless pc when needed unfortunately need to disconnect my separate wireless mouseconnector in order to charge up the battery for the keyboard as my pc only has usb ports on the left side from what can tell as don know if it might have few more usb ports in the very back which is bit of possible small letdown but am sure ll get used to it overtime with that said it arrived in timely quick manner am super excited to begin using it gonna hope that itwill last as long as it does 
1,i love it great sound and kicking bass for such small speaker 
1,very comfortable and the noise cancellation is amazing
0,little heavy is my only complaint otherwise very nice
0,i ve had this speaker for about months and everything is great with it but really irritated because one of the sub speakers have blown this was pretty expensive speaker and now that that blew it sounds really bad

1,great sound small and compact but very clear and loud great product 
0,cursor would only work couple minutes then freeze up love the look shape but it completely useless 
1,overall the headset is honestly not bad for the pricing that it was it has good audio and all components are together

1,great product and excellent food gaming and listening to music
0,the charge for this mouse only lasts day very annoying and it isnt the most quiet either feels cheap performs meh dont waste your money 
1,not having to change the battery is what drew me to this but it goes to sleep to save power and is hard to get it working again thought the slim profile mouse would be ok and better for travel but it is too hard to hold thought it might just be my big hands and gave it to my wife she gave it back and said it was hard for her to hold on too 
0,i like this for school
0,it quit working it dead er than door knob 
1,its cool little mouse got it for work reasons like the rgb on it works as intended not really pricey 
0,the mic sounded as if were trying to communicate with you from another level in the house 
1,this product is good for gaming and the sound quality is perfect 
1,i have been using the wireless mouse for weeks waited to write the review so could truly review it based on my experience it has not disappointed me and like everything about it charge it whenever remember to the design is sleek and the changing colors are soothing when take my eyes off the screen stare at the mouse the respond to clicks is smooth and quick can feel the clicks but not hear the clicks

1,great mouse works just as described unfortunately the charging cable didn work thank goodness we have extras great purchase tho 
0,absolute garbage listen to the negative reviews and the ones saying the company is spamming them begging to remove their posts the lights are haywire with no pattern randomly switching off and on dpi is not adjustable pretty sure that lie feels like the lowest grade plastic ve ever felt does not track lights will give you seizure without doubt this company is scamming you 
0,i loved it at first but the mouse started making squeaking noise when used the roller it was very annoying in class 
0,at first this mouse was the best ever however whenever it touches table the bottom red light turns on and makes the colors look all messed up it was still very comfortable though however months later whenever turned it on it would start autoclicking and the only way to stop it is to remove the usb charger it great for the first months but then started failing me 
0,battery won stay charged very long
0,the sound quality is good but keep accidentally pressing the scroll down on the sound also for my pc the mic is absolutely terrible no one can hear me at all for pc get different headset

0,left button not working after months for not worth it save you money and look for better one the last 
1,love it it so sleek and comfortable to use love the color and the light changing aspect 
1,for me you had to have the headphone jack in certain spot and stay still for the sound to stay on it works only sometimes but the more you move the more it cuts out but the sound was very clear and my party could hear me clear when it did work 
1,had few issues but customer service was awesome problem was resolved immediately overall would buy headset again 
1,it would sometimes require extra force to register the click so definitely don recommend it for gaming the optics worked very well so it definitely good normal use mouse 
0,i am told people can barely hear me when im not talking loud its probably the distance the mic is from my face bc its worse when the mic isn all the way down also dont use the lights on this hook it into my game controller which is way too far from any computers to be able to plug the usb in at the same time which powers the lights if ur audio plug is right next to usb plug there shouldn be much issue this does not have the feature that turns the mic off when the bar containing the mic is up over all got this on primeday and its my st headset ive used for gaming its functional

0,nothing special about this keyboard not fond of the manufacturers website adding to this review after less than year of use the battery is failing one of the issues is the forced keyboard lighting there is no way to turn it off while the keyboard saw heavy use the main function wireless is hampered by poor design am reducing my review to reflect this issue after testing do not recommend this product

1,this was gift for my boyfriend and might be stealing it from him xdit sounds really good indoors we haven tried outdoors yet the sound is clear and the bass sounds great was worried because of the comments saying that is mono trust me that is not even perceptible it sounds great we are not party persons so we have not thrown party using this speaker we connect it to the tv laptop or mobile and watch movies tv shows or listen music for these type of uses is perfect 
1,really like this mouse never thought say that it stores the usb port in its belly when you need to disconnect which is super helpful for someone who loses small pieces it quiet click which appreciate even when working alone and the rainbow lighting is optional win win win it light too as it rechargeable carry it with my laptop and it made working on the go better

1,love this and use it all the time 
1,it perfect 
1,they do feel cheap and that ok for the price but the mic and sound are better than expected so you won be disappointed of you consider the price the mic is loud and clear and it does an amazing job at filtering my music playing on the background so it just picks up my voice and does not disturb other players 
1,i thought was getting better mouse by splurging on the more expensive option but guess that doesn seem to matter would think get decent working product for bucks but guess that also doesn seem to be thing save yourself the trouble of thinking this is quality product and actually buy mouse that works have had all similar issues of not working after about month of use broke college student and really wish could have saved myself time and money 
0,amazing headset but my only complaint is the people talking to me in discord were hearing themselves talk through the headset and into my mic back to them so had to work on and fix that beside that no complaints

0,first time charging this mouse started smelling burnt plastic smell in my home walked over to where it was charging and noticed the smell was lot stronger reached down to unplug it and the cord was red hot had not been in that room it would have started fire not happy

0,you could think it decent mouse for the price you paid but in reality it is an uncomfortable mouse and barely works the only good thing about this mouse is that it comes with usb to usb adapter which comes in handy 
0,i had to replace second one of these because single drop to floor renders it inoperable 
0,mouse is fine but my usb adapter was junk from the start be aware if you re planning on using it in one of these ports 
1,the best
0,over priced
1,love the lighted background makes finding keys in low or no light situation wonderful price was good to for quality of product
0,i used this mouse once after this use it died so was going to charge it up figuring didn give it enough time to charge tried different times and it wouldn charge at all so decided to just go back to my old mouse tried to remove the usb and the metal part broke off and stayed inside my laptop so had to remove it and there was no fixing it so disappointed in the quality of this mouse

0,this mouse did not work the wireless receiver did work so the mouse did not connect to my laptop 
1,great and affordable 
1,so we ve gone thru quite few wireless items over the last few years this one by far has knocked it out of the park actually allowed my year old to pick her mouse this year she and she picked based on color read the description the review were good and the price was right so we hit buy now love sleep mode really love that it rechargeable battery lasts weeks like that it lights up when it charging and let you know when it done and an added bonus it the cutest shade of baby pink 
0,i liked the look feel and price of this mouse however after less than months of moderate use while playing game clicked the wheel and it broke this item was not made to last cheap and not worth the money in my opinion 
0,the sound is crystal clear and the wire prevents easy entanglement but ve noticed something after couple of weeks of use the ear pieces aren comfortable for adults due to them being too small and what even worse is that wear glasses and it makes it even more uncomfortable for me and even making it difficult to focus during gaming have to constantly try to move them around just for it to be bearable in comfort so warning not recommended with glasses and or adults 
0,i have macbook and it would not connect have charged the mouse for hours and still will not connect 
1,cheap cheap cheap cheapquit working like day and now am outside of return window good thing it was cheap buyers beware spend little more

1,good rich sound and plenty loud if you want 
0,not even month and it broken
1,purchased for my son to use for talking to his friends while playing video games works well and he can hear them clearly he does not hear us calling him for dinner so would say the noise cancellation is good too

0,i ordered this product but the cursor kept jumping around the screen even when it was fully charged figured just got bad apple so made an exchange for new one the new mouse came scratched not big deal and the scroll wheel wasn as smooth annoying but its fine but this one cursor is jumping around the screen too would have otherwise liked the mouse it charges up quickly and appreciate the sleep mode so that that battery life lasts longer 
1,bought these for my year old and he absolutely loves them they work well with his android phone and ps 
1,sounds like gigantic speaker my daughter had one of these from amazon and loved it on her coffee table to use with tv across the room so bought it and was impressed when listening to my amazon downloaded music hubby heard it and bought himself the next version up to enhance his ipad music amazing sound from small unit we ve use it in the garage to practice our dance steps and the quality is excellent 
1,sound quality is little muddy other than that its great speaker for the size 
1,junk charged it and used it several times it worked for about handful of times charged again the light on the switch flashes but turns off immediately so that it won go on even though it is charged save your money and by well known brand

1,works and the battery lasts week or two with frequent use and charges easily one less cord to get snarled in my laptop case too the lights around the edge seem silly but do make it easy to keep track of it in the dark goes to sleep after few minutes of nonuse requires mouse click to wake it up nuisance but that means you need not bother to turn it off overall very pleased

1,comfortable headset 
1,i used this keyboard for remote work after months of having it the letter went out other than that it worked great 
1,great quality sound easy to connected to devices
0,dissatisfied with purchase mouse works except for the scrolling wheel 
0,about weeks after return window closed quit working completely should have returned sooner as the charge lasts only about one full work day spent lot of time fooling around with mouse tool that should be something you don have to think about or make plans to be available for use going back to tried and true battery wireless which lasts about year and no hassle 
1,i really like this mouse just wish had way to know what the battery was at or when it is getting low

1,it came really fast got it in one day it is really sleek and works really smooth chose my favorite color of course but love all the colors the light goes through also really like that it has button to keep the mouse on but turn off the light and of course it is nice that you can charge it rather than use batteries the other mouse have have to use batteries so that was major selling point for this one

1,i no audiophile but have been amazed by the sound quality of this speaker hearing subtle sounds from my classic rock tracks that have never noticed and this compares to both bose wave and their portable brick friend has the version and think this has better sound the range is superior to any of the bluetooth speakers have used and just realized can keep the phone close because of the charging capabilities don know if these other reviewers were expecting live philharmonic sound quality because this speaker is awesome

1,i bought this as father day gift for my dad he was really excited for it he said he loved the sound quality and the rich bass to it battery life is also solid and this little speaker is super loud

0,cursor would only work couple minutes then freeze up love the look shape but it completely useless 
1,sounds awesome connects right away no complaints
1,the keyboard works wonders love how accurate and speedy it is and how it shuts off when not in use to save power in addition to that klim is such wonderful company with excellent customer service had misplaced my wireless dongle the little black usb piece that is for the keyboard and they were more than happy to send me new one at no extra charge they even included little french candy with my dongle love klim 
0,dont buy stopped working after weeks
1,looks great feels comfortable however when lifting the mouse it would shoot the cursor all over the screen which can be frustrating when playing games or working on detailed spreadsheets 
1,product is easy to use and has great sound quality
1,love this mouse just what was looking for
1,nice looking quiet works well 
0,easy to use
1,i loved the simplicity of this product super sleek and in color that matched my laptop would recommend to anyone looking for minimalist design just look at how it matches with my setup 
1,this gaming headset is perfect for gamers and truly worth it 
0,it is good for noise canceling
1,my daughter has used this speaker for everything it is lot heavier than we imagined but still portable enough to take out to the pool or cheer practice
1,awesome works great 
0,it doesn stay charged for very long
0,for gaming
0,the keyboard itself as keyboard works fine however there are few things that need improvement the backlight needs to be brighter and the individual keys need to stay lite up even when the backlight fades out need to give the user the option to select to keep the back light on constantly instead of just fading or off user that likes the back light to stay on not fan of the fading in out as it makes it hard to see the keys in the dark especially if trying to find numbers and symbols the enter key is too far to the right for comfortable typing selection meaning that the enter key should be where the key is normal keyboards have the enter key closer in this position so when typing we easily select the right key but you have the key where the enter key should be so it interferes and causes us to hit the wrong key the keyboard isn that quiet hitting the keys when typing softly the keys still make lot of noise 
1,i love this headset other than the type of microphone it has like bendy ones it awesome 
1,there nothing majorly egregiously wrong with this mouse but it doesn necessarily excel at anything the mouse is pretty light the buttons are reasonably clicky and responsive the sleep mode is bit aggressive and find myself often annoyed with how quickly the mouse goes to sleep and have to wait for it to reconnect before using it again the dpi is by far the biggest problem it doesn feel like the dpi switch on the mouse actually does anything and it almost feels like the dpi changes randomly while in use ve noticed this behavior with mouse mat and on flat desk alone this may be just my unit but beware it nonetheless overall it definitely good enough for what needed cheap wireless rechargeable mouse that is passable for office work however wouldn use it for anything beyond that 
1,tiny great for laptop size 
1,i needed wireless mouse for my new laptop and found this to be reasonable price it is great design usb dongle can mount under the mouse itself for travel so you don lose it as it is very compact which is really nice for laptop has two modes one is on and the other mode is on with color it nice to have the option as to be able to save battery life the mouse clicks are silent which was different experience for me but it nice it does go into standby mode if not used to save battery and takes couple seconds to wake up but to me this is better than killing the battery all in all this was good purchase 
0,it jbl nothing more to say
1,i personally believe they are the best in the speaker business great sound quality on every bluetooth that have heard and price is reasonable
1,i love how they light up and great background sound canceling 
1,so far so good
0,bought for work
1,wife loves it she uses it daily with no issues led is nice and bright would be nice to add larger capacity battery 
1,surprized it had charger happy
0,there is an input delay when you press key it takes half second to actually register which can make huge difference in professional gaming 
1,out of the box couldn get this mouse to connect with my macbook pro gave up after min of trying then tried again in couple days now it does connect but its unusable the mouse moves mm on my screen for huge amount of movement and yes checked the tracking speed in my settings clicking on anything takes about tries and scrolling is impossible upset by the deceitful overall rating of this mouse swear there are bots falsely giving this mouse good ratings 
1,this mouse won track straight and learned that if turn off the led lights with the bottom switch it tracks pretty well obviously there bad design here leds are interfering with mouse tracking ve just been turning off the leds to use it 
0,wouldn recommend have been trying to charge it for days 
0,easy to use
1,excellent
1,this mouse is quiet as advertised so it nice as someone sleeps in my office while do schoolwork most of the time the sleep mode on it is nice but feel it triggers too soon that being said it bothersome but not deal breaker was concerned about the quality upon receiving it as it is quite light and feels cheaply made sure it is but it traveled in my laptop case quite successfully without incident knock on wood sure if dropped or enough pressure was put on it it could very well break or crack but if you treat it well don see why this mouse shouldn last you ve had it for about month now and the only thing can complain about is the sleep timer so take that as you will 
0,did not work and can return now don buy 
1,i bought this product to use in my art studio but bring it outside all the time the sound quality is great would buy another one if they can be linked

0,this mouse really only worked for about two months now it seems to need to be charged more frequently takes long time to charge and does not move smoothly it sort of sticks to the point that it is very annoying to use 
0,broken and flimsy on arrival
1,i wanted to find slim wireless mouse similar to mac magic mouse without the high price tag while this certainly isn magic mouse it pretty good substitute for fraction of the cost there are some tradeoffs of course due to the slim nature of this mouse it is extremely lightweight not built like tank and sometimes the buttons require sturdy click to ensure response but all in all happy with my purchase it looks nice works well and it has gone about months so far without needing recharge speaking of which leave the mouse on all the time and it goes into sleep mode no big deal just realize you need to click button to wake it up once you power on your laptop or desktop otherwise it will seem like the mouse isn working also ve had couple of instances where had to reinsert the usb adapter to get it to reconnect but that was maybe times in the past couple of months in short recommend this product the company provided great support when received the wrong color mouse and they ve been top notch to deal with they stand behind their product

1,bought this to replace my old apple mouse it works well holds charge easy to recharge no problems it did take little relearning to use the wheel vs the apple mouse smooth glide system great price too 
1,great product work ls like described xbox one never sounded so good 
1,my old headset was going out so had to buy new one saw this in the amazon choice on sale for over half off and the reviews were good so bought it came in day sooner than expected they have great sound came in at full volume and had to lower the volume since it was so loud don use the mic because have standalone mic so can say how that works my only complaint is the ear cushions aren as comfortable as hoped they re kind of stiff 
1,worked good for the first months used the mouse on security camera hard drive to review camera footage worked fine one time and after that no cursor icon appeared tried plugging it back into my desktop and still no cursor icon available it won select anything only right click works but can scroll to selection luckily my desktop is touch screen so manually opened up the drives properties and it said that all device functions are working properly clearly not being able to see cursor is an issue

0,it stopped working after weeks the lights would appear and it looked like it would charge but the mouse was nonresponsive to movement it worked for week or two before this happened so know how it was supposed to work before it stopped working the surface felt silky to the touch but that about the only plus can give this product as cool as the lights look wouldn recommend wasting your money on this invest little extra and go with more reputable and reliable brand that won break after weeks ll be doing the same after this disappointment 
0,the usb charging port was bent had to bend back before could even plug it in to use amazon needs to start labeling the country of origin don want to support country that suppresses its people destroyed democracy in hong kong made in china junk 
1,this headset is perfect for ps its also pretty good for xbox but dont like how you have to plug in the extra cord and its very short give it only for the short cord but other than that it is perfect comfortable and overall good looking also like how it was packaged so neat and safely 
1,i honestly love this product the keys are very comfortable to use and the ergonomics of the keyboard are conducive for gaming and typing my keyboard did experience some issues with the left side shift key after about years of heavy use so reached out to customer support and was mailed replacement in about days after contacting them the customer support team is extremely friendly and helpful overall this is an excellent product and excellent company will absolutely purchase any pc hardware from klim in the future

0,light never turned on came dirty

1,i love this this so pretty battery life has been good only charged once so far in weeks
1,purchased it for my son who is gamer he picked it out after doing the research on amazon he really enjoys the every aspect of the keyboard it is lightweight therefore he has taken it with him abroad 
0,headphones came in bag not in box no instructions and no warranty info 
1, needed new cheap mouse and this was on sale and read through lot of reviews saw lot of reviews stating that there was chance that the white version could potentially not be solid white allowing for the lights to show through the mouse through the top well that sounded cool to me so ordered white hoping that mine would also do the same pleased to report that it does so be warned that ordering the white version has chance to do this and apparently often find it fun though also happy to note that there is an inactivity timer on the mouse so when not in use it will conserve it battery power by turning off clicking with the mouse will turn it back on battery life has been good so far too work from home for hrs day and it survives my work day easily just plug it up to charge after work 
1,great speaker until it completely died on me year after purchase will not hold charge or play sound now but will turn on wish had bought the warranty 
0,it good
0,just got the item today everything works out great but the usb could not fit into the adapter neither could any other usb as seen in the picture they all try to go in sideways and thats why they wont fit so even though the product works just fine am unable to use it which is why its three star regardless if you have normal usb ports this product will work just fine 
1,the mouse falls asleep right away the cord for recharging is only about in in long constantly needs to be recharged it is definitely not five star product it looks cool 
0,i received my speaker went to use it and it kept crackling so had to send it back was not impressed with this product and then they wouldn let me exchange it for new one had to get refund
1,so when reading the reviews seen bunch of bad ones that were posted recently and it honestly scared me still got them anyways because don mind for how long they last but the mic is pretty good for now take care of my stuff so ll make this mic last for the time need it for but it from me so far 
1,sounds great
1,i loved this mouse when first got it it moves nicely and the colors around the base is awesome could tell it was cheaply made but didn think more of it just went to use it now and the scroller in the middle is busted it rotates but it doesn do anything on my computer 
1,i had an older smaller jbl and the battery stopped holding charge upgraded it to this larger unit the sound is great and the larger battery lasts long time it will run out faster if you are also charging your phone while using it but that fair tradeoff the bluetooth connectivity is flawless 
1,i wanted silent or soft clicks and that what got the led light were bonus for me 
1,i like stuff loud bit of an audiophile but don like spending lot unless it worth it prefer cheap and effective and that is this used to use the official playstation wireless headphones that cost over and those were great but then they stopped charging and got these freed up the usb port that was being used by the wireless headphones because these headphones plug into the wireless controller so for lot less money it still wireless and they sound great 
1,great bass and battery life but crackles at low volume but sounds great at and up
0,barely worked for few hours and died
1,for some reason ordered red and got grey but other than that the sound is great and the battery lasts long time took it on two beach pool trips and it was great
1,awesome and cool the color turns red when it time to plug in and recharge 
1,i like how it is light weight and the sound quality is good
1,very basic mouse rechargeable battery that lasts awhile great for just needing simple wireless option at good price 
1,nice little speaker worked right away still haven had to charge it after unboxing and playing hra so far 
1,nothing to dislike got it for my grandson he loves it
1,soft click it light weight cute lights love it 
0,easy to use wonderful look and feel feel that it could be bit brighter the company answered and solved my problem with in an hour the problem was my mistake but they helped me out anyways 
1,great sound it simplicity is it key it is meant to be an outdoor speaker and to fill up wider area so don listen to those who complain it not stereo stereo is useless if it speakers are so close together it not too big the accessories you can buy are good like the rubber carry case and the hard case as well
1,loves
1,scrolling is very easy and quick this mouse is slim and easy to manuver mostly love the ergonomic and backlighting design the sleep mode feature is nice just have to remember to turn the mouse off then on to reactivate the scrolling feature 
0,appearance is bit different than was expecting also doesn glide smoothly and quickly enough on the screen not sure why sending back after day of use swiched to my old bluetooth mouse within hours
0,came defective
0,the mouse is comfortable to use notice while using it there is bit of lag would recommend if the slim design is what you are looking for would not recommend for gaming use it for work 
1,great sound and volume for small speaker
0,the mouse is cool design with it lighting up as you move the mouse around my only grip with it is the mouse scroll wheel is not functional ve only had it for months and the scroll wheel stop working thought that with charging the unit it would fix the problem but to no eval unfortunately would not purchase this again 
1,charged up quickly in little over an hour looks great feels great but the scrolling wheel does not work looking at it closely it looks like the wheel is slightly off center it spins freely like it isn connected to anything back it goes 
1,works great sounds great 
1,i have purchased many gaming headphones for my sons these are the first that not only work but work extremely well they were also the easiest to set up the sound quality is great and guessing that they have fabulous noise cancellation capabilities as my sons seem to not be able to hear me when they re wearing them 
1,i like this headset lot more than the red and blue headset the microphone quality has some issues using it on discord and can be little tricky to gauge the sensitivity but the sound is pretty good it is crisp for the most part love to use these headphones because they re also very comfortable 
0,i don like the sleep mode if that what it is that makes me have to press the button every time want to use it again rather it just stay on also it has to be recharged every days and not big computer user so that pain because have to change the cord and usb every time 
1,less months old worked great at first and now it won charge it crap
0,good
0,it double types and disconnects all the time 
1,my son loves his headset they are perfect for his ps
0,right out of the box the mouse never worked the buttons activate but the mouse never moved the cursor junk 
1,not waterproof started to sound fuzzy after months of using it great if it going to be indoors and not in extreme conditions 
1,like playing on my ps
0,used it only for the past months and it doesnt work anymore 
1,i bought this for my xbox one works great looks beautiful 
1,i use this product for aesthetic when studying it really great 
0,this thing is nuts the sound looks material everything was so worth it 
1,excellent headset for the price easy to use with windows plug and play sits over the ear so the noise cancelling is passive you can still somewhat hear things going on around you but its not disturbing
1,love the colors
1,awesome
0,very good come back if need to
1,my husband enjoys movies however his taste and my taste aren the same since getting these headphones we can be in the same room with him enjoying movie on his laptop while watching movie on tv my husband says the sound quality of these headphones is good as far as noise cancelling he says that some background noise does creep in but not enough to interfere with whatever movie he watching pleased with these headphones and will probably buy another pair for my grandson 
1,it is amazing wanted to wait days for any weird stuff or just sign of cheap plastic but no it passes the test want to congratulate them for their amazing microphone quality too 
1,i like the fact that it turns off after some time like that it works with usb and like that can use it with my mac or my pc and like the charging cable 
1,i honestly listen to this little speaker about everyday for the last years especially love it by the pool it holding up great the battery runs for at least hours maybe more for the money it great deal 
1,i find that not having to rely on battery is relief the color change is very nice
0,returned since it was missing the usb adapter this is the only reason why purchased it since needed usb port for my flashdrive 
0,could barely hear anything with all the volume turned up returned 
1,my son loves his headphones no complaints so far 
1,works great very reactive colors look fantastic while they go through all the different colors as well as has an option for just red if you re not feeling fancy
1,i love it silently clicks automatically goes to sleep conserving battery and slick design
1,fits prefect in my hand and the lights are great to keep tack of the mouse in dark room 
0,they aren bad for the price but my earbuds on my phone are louder than this don use them as often because of this 
0,started out pretty good but after about weeks the mouse no longer tracks properly even after charging all night after about to minutes of use the cursor refuses to respond to the mouse movements 
0,beautifully produced and lovely to look at for mouse the lights are welcome addition to an otherwise drab workspace did notice that it tends to go into sleep mode quickly but takes longer wake up time than expect on screen busy with windows the cursor freezes in position until the mouse fully comes back to life it frustrating for anyone who isn patient 
0,it is quite nice it has an interesting style and the colored lights give it special touch unfortunately in terms of performance is lousy the sleep mode seems to fail constantly sometimes it turns off for no reason and stops working for while being fully charged so it must be damaged internally very disappointed with this product no matter how nice it is it is not worth buying if it does not fulfill its main function 
0,bought this to get rid of wires on my desk and it has been great but the battery doesn last as long as expected and that with the backlights turned off was also disappointed to find that not all usb cables work to charge it lost the cable that comes with the keyboard to charge it and when it died only one of my usb cables would charge it and found that really strange not totally sure why that is but it something that noticed so if you don have lot of usb cables don lose the one that comes with it otherwise you might not be able to charge it otherwise like it haven had any problems other than what is mentioned 
1,clear sounds and very powerful love the red color makes it super fun 
1,i don use this keyboard for game but type lot like it being very quiet when type and the led light is pretty when it on bought one of this keyboard couple months ago for work like it so much then bought another one for my home computer not expensive but good quality product 
1,this speaker is great if you want big boom out of smallish speaker this is big step up from the flip with how loud it gets the battery life is amazing and stays alive for long time 
0,it barely works went back to the mouse was using when bought this which is on its last leg and it works better still skip this product 
1,great for gaming 
0,i bought this to replace another that had used from august to december replaced the first one due to the spinner breaking was hoping that the new one would last longer but it only lasted weeks completely disappointed in it 
1,this is great little mouse for someone like me that has smaller hands and some nerve issues as well it is light not bulky and works so smoothly would highly recommend it and will purchase another for friend 
1,love it
1,good headset works as expected confortable support wish the usb part was longer so it could go into my ps other then that works great
0,purchased two works as described you can beat this price highly recommend 
1,my kiddo needed wireless mouse to take with him to school and this was so fun for him it light weight pretty durable and love that he can charge it along with his laptop at night 
0,not impressed just not loud as expected tribit max is less expensive with much more huge clear sound compared to this 
0,it does not work
1,this mouse is amazing work in it and have been working from home for quite some time there are days where have to work hours my hand does not get tired at all when using this mouse for long periods of time it is super easy to setup just connect to the usb and you re done the best part that love about this mouse is that it is superrrrrrrrrr quiet the weeks that on call do not have to feel discouraged and walking on eggshells when have to respond to an urgent matter in the middle of the night and having to risk waking up my partner with the continuous mouse clicking sound will definitely buy another one just in case if lose it 
1,great product with reasonable price bought second one 
0,absolute garbage 
0,i suggest this speaker it like surround sound system 
1,amazing head phones love them but sometimes it starts to echo on my ps but it fixes it self if lower the volume little other than thst they are amazing for that price
0,i had the jbl charge and the xtreme the sound quality is equal to the charge and didn sound any better at all the style changed but other then that it did not impress besides being smaller it not better then the extreme in any way ended up returning it 
1,works good very comfortable when using it for work and gaming battery life is about hrs say that because it almost lasted full work week 
0,expected better sound from the product 
0,fully charged it still started cutting out within an hour of use and now doesn connect at all 
1,works great
1,son loves them they are comfortable on his ears 
1,very good quality sleek and pretty use it for my desk at work the only issue is when using it to scroll page the ball starts squeaking otherwise it great 
0,it was good product until my dog decided to make it it chew toy my son used it for gaming only had to listen to him yell out things instead of all the players yelling ish out and whining about who was killing who blah blah blah
1,great product
0,ear muffs feel cheap and after an hour it just feels weird on you head solid pass
1,edit their customer service reached out after posted the review saying they changed manufacturers and asked me to give them another shot tried them again and while still can say they re noise canceling the sound and fit are excellent for the price the microphone quality is pretty nice too friend mentioned it makes gaming with me much easier lol all in all these are prolly headphones at price point and the customer service is incredibly responsive the sound is pretty good and they fit well but it blocks no sound whatsoever if that mainly why you re buying it you ll want to look elsewhere even with sound playing can hear background noise clearly
0,the adapter for the laptop doesn work have one from dell which worked fine 
0,i really like this mouse for work use mine all day charge it on wednesday mid week and leave it charging friday over the weekend works completely fine coming back and buying two more had to come buy more because dropped mine and it cracked open that the only reason why not because it stopped working but because broke mine so this time in also getting backup my work laptop is mac and rather much buy this mouse than the expensive apple one 
0,i have had this for about week and haven had to charge it at all initial setup was breeze my primary use is for late night console gaming with limited or no ambient lighting the brightness is just right for my usage making the keys easy to see and use switching between consoles is also breese 
0,only the microphone jack worked for me it comes with splitter but that did not fix the issue again do not buy this product for pc 
0,the mouse itself still works but the usb port has just broken in million pieces my laptop stays at home and it is what use as my home computer after about month of use the usb port is just the piece that pushes into the laptop and the plastic tip is just gone one more break and it will either be stuck in my computer or will be unable to use the mouse 
0,when first received this charged it as recommended and it lit up so seemed to work as expected after charged put the toggle in my usb port and nothing happened it didn download anything it didn pair with my laptop let it sit then tried again nothing it won charge it won light up nothing never even used it and it stopped working very disappointed and total waste of money 
0,the idea of this mouse sounded nice and fun however was very disappointed to see that the usb is slightly bigger than other usb cables and it did not fit into my laptop or any other usb port for that matter perhaps this one was defective but this was unacceptable would give zero stars if could 
0,works well but son broke within week dropped it and it shattered 
0,battery doesn last long and sleep mode is annoying so tossed it without warning it will just quit on you going back to battery brand 
0,the battery of this mouse works well haven timed it but have left it on overnight and it stills has battery not gamer but imagine the gaming quality will be affected depending on how strong the bluetooth connection of the mouse is to the pc setup recently switched from laptop that had the standard rectangular port usb to one that needed the adapter usb the adapter that comes with the mouse worked for about minute before it stop functioning so brought out my own adapter from different device and the mouse now works also tested both adapters with wired mouse it suffices to say that it was the mouse adapter that is not working could have gotten faulty one so the problem could be exclusive to me tl dr mouse adapter didn work ur screwed if urs doesn work either and don have an extra one 
0,very poor sound little to zero bass poor app support and miserablr battery life if you are using this for outdoor or warehouse usage it will disappoint full charge this morning granted hours of play at to volume quite far beneath the hours promised if it had lasted hours might keep it but the sound just isn worth metal music sounds terrible and you have to put your ear up to the speaker to hear it at volume how does this garbage get passed off as premium stuff returning it immediately and taking the leap to bose 
0,i purchased this headset for my son for christmas it seemed to work fine for around months but as of now the mic no longer works how friends can hear him he can hear anyone else so he can no longer even use them total waste of money 
1,i have touchscreen chromebook but still need mouse to use on excel worksheet this is slim easy to use and handy led lights is plus 
1,the mouse is nicely shaped and feels nice in your hand the clicking is quiet the only problem is that it does not stay charged more than one day so have to keep it plugged in which defeats the purpose of having wireless mouse

0,after exactly two months the roller wheel in the middle broke tried prying it apart and it is not fixable and is pain to always have to use the scrollbar with the mouse the lights are kind of distracting not necessary however it does stay charged for week or more at time cheap and bought this for data work it works other than the middle wheel now and is okay for the price or if you don have high expectations

1,won hold charge
0,when using at higher volumes the sound has some distortion
1,cordless mouse is okay out of the box after few months of use it starting to wear out now have to start double clicking to make sure it responds to the icons click on colors are still great it great not having to change batteries it pretty much quite as far as clicking but as noted above it will still wear out sooner than expected

1,bought this led wireless mouse july and received it couple of day later and really loved it well now it aug and as of yesterday it suddenly stopped working correctly don even use it with the fancy light changes on tried charging it couple of times and even once over night and it is still not functioning as it should noticed that if left still for few minutes it would sometimes function well but only for few seconds and then it would begin to sporadically move the cursor if at all the little laser guide light goes dim and blinks quite fast am thinking that it suddenly cannot hold charge oh have also tried using it while connected to the charge port but it does the same would have given it star rating if it continued working properly as really like it however since the sudden misfunction cannot give it more than stars and must say that would not recommend this mouse anymore 
1,awesome keyboard makes pc gaming much more better experience

0,this headset is so big and bulky especially for kid the audio is fine and is better than most budget headsets the mic started having static issues after months every time you slightly move the cable the static is incredibly loud through the mic to the people you re playing with that tells me the internal components are poor quality or poorly put together 
1,it just great in everything good sound waterproof great bluetooth connection definitely recommend it 
1,i got this mouse on thursday night only charged it for less than minutes not full charge and have been using it for days in row on the red light mode only thought it would run out of power in day or two but is still working nicely the mouse feels comfortable under my palm not too big or too small was ready to be disappointed for the price vs quality but so far so good 
0,right out the box noticed the very plastic cheap feel the rbg lights are bright but honestly bought it for cheap mouse after using it for while the wrist did start hurting little the worse part is after it died for the first time did full charge and it has not worked since sure can go through the warranty but ll just take the loss you get what you paid for 
1,when bought this mouse really liked it it felt nice worked well on consistent basis and the colors give my desk pretty touch it was cheap so guess you can expect it to last but was hoping to get at least year after months of light daily use it doesn want to charge even if leave it plugged in all night in the morning it barely has any charge this is decent mouse if you don mind having to buy new one couple of times year but going to just spend little more and get one that is hopefully better quality

0,this mouse worked for day and then stopped it was very comfortable to use and silent click which was nice but it stopped working so it pointless 
1,a bit heavy and awkward but would expect that at this price point my only real complaint is in the cord design am using with ps and the cord splits in one is mm jack that plugs into the controller and supplies the sound which works fine the other is usb jack that supplies power to the led lights and should plug into the console the problem is that the cord splits at the last inches or so if you want to use the usb for the lights you need to either buy separate usb extension or keep your controller at least inches from your console which is very impractical if not impossible just bad design it should split much further up the cord so that both can plug in to their appropriate places at the same time had stars but lowered to because don like companies that offer money for reviews they ve been sending incessant emails saying they will refund if remove my review how about you just make decent product my integrity can be bought for 
0,this item popped up for results what compatible for ps and this is not
0,it pretty decent headphones for the price you pay
1,i love this mouse but hate it at the same time love it because it cute and it functions well that is if it doesn run out of battery charge during normal use the charge only lasts for about days it good that it can be recharged just didn think would be recharging it that often you can tell when it running low because it starts jumping all over the place just try to remember to charge it while charging my laptop also was under the impression that it came as usbc to charge and it does not it comes with an adapter for usb to usbc could ve just got an adapter for my old mouse had it been made clear 
0,wish they would get louder noise cancellation not very good 
1,absolute great product sound ease of use and portability is amazing 
0,this keyboard is decent it types well has good tactile response and an easy to adjust to layout in addition the rgb backlight works great and looks good minor flaw the flip out legs to prop the keyboard to more ergonomic position tend to close easily from the pressure of typing or gaming minor flaw if you type all day and game all night this is not the keyboard for you since the battery life when subjected to all day activity is relatively short have to charge the keyboard literally five times as often as my wireless mouse of different brand major flaw given that battery life is not where would like it to be the biggest problem with this keyboard is that there is absolutely no warning that the battery on the keyboard is low you are typing or gaming and the keyboard suddenly becomes non responsive because the battery is suddenly dead of course quickly resolved by plugging in the charging cord but incredibly annoying and inconvenient overall decent keyboard but not having any type of warning that the battery is almost dead is really annoying since having to stop and plug it in often causes the loss of train of thought when working or the death of my avatar when gaming pretty lights though 
1,easy to set up and the sound is amazing 
0,using this every friday for background music at community event good sound quality 
1,these are great headphones my year old son loves them the noise canceling is very impressive on them for the price 
0,i thought the sound was going to be louder than the old model but not so decided to return it it too expensive 
0,i am very disappointed with the quality of life this mouse has bought it and was only able to use it four or five times and it has been problem for me ever since ve charged it adequately and it won start not sure if its factory malfunction or not but it should still be working ve owned it for little over month now 
1,update received response from the seller and they are sending me new mouse super quick response time so updated my rating super cute and fun that it lights up but doesn last only have had this months and the scroll broke 
1,perfect mouse for laptop ve been using it for little over months usually for few hours everyday and haven changed to batteries yet the only problem have is love watching the colors change so much start to zone out on my work time very relaxing 
1,super comfortable to use 
1,great sound very light for head set
1,the klim is extremely quiet which is the number one thing that is important to me battery life is great plus it is rechargeable my only complaint is the connection would rate it about due to it sometimes randomly losing connection after two months my key is starting to rub off back light to the keyboard is perfect in my opinion price for the keyboard is really good think this keyboard will last about year for me overall great keyboard love it 
0,iy works so what can one say about mouse 
0,this mouse works for mins or less at time then has to be powered off and on it starts lagging charged it all night so its not battery issue and it only works when its all lit up not in the mode

1,totally recommend this little piece of amazing 
0,it had connectivity issues right out of the box contacted the seller and he she did not respond it never worked even if it had it is so misshapen it isn comfortable to use cannot recommend seller or product 
0,i was really excited about buying this speaker when bought it because ve needed it for while and have lot of use for it at the moment however it has been completely unreliable for me because it hasn been able to hold charge think it has only been charged fully times and now it never charges the chargers used are brand new and the speaker is brand new did factory reset more than once and it still won charge the light blinks as if it is charging but it stays dead am so disappointed in this purchase and hope the speaker can be replaced or exchanged 
1,fits in my golfcart cubby sounds great great for beach camping or anywhere inside or outside jbl is the best name brand hands down 
1,you will have great piece of technology in your ears at low cost just enjoy them 
0,its only been couple of months since started using this keyboard but am not able to use it when it is plugged in for charging anymore this is really annoying as have to switch to different keyboard when this one dies not very reliable product 
1,this is supposed to be an upgrade from charge but they decided to only put one primary driver in and it shows bass response is good but the music sound incomplete either stick with the charge or pony up little more for the extreme 
1,the sound quality is good only thing is it would be nice if it can go louder higher volume 
0,i have one and my grandson liked it so got him one for his birthday
1,i love the look and the lights are super cool and the sound is very nice love it
1,ergonomically it nice little clickier than expected the lights aren as bright as expected and the charge seems to be not very long had it unplugged for about an hour and not constantly typing and just had to plug it in as it seemed to be not registering keystrokes feel paid way too much
1,i like the feel and look of this mouse bought it as deal of the day really like how it changes colors and how smooth it feels also love that you can recharge it only dislike is that review and edit important documents for work and sometimes the cursor would move unexpectedly and will cause me to type something wasn trying to type ll have to undo whatever did other than that good price and quality 
1,been wearing these for multiple hours day and they are comfortable the sound is good too minus is there is no pause play button on the cord but it has mic on and off switch which is nice 
0,this is the second time bought this in months and the same thing happened the wire broke from the headsetreally bad quality when it comes to the wiring
0,battery dies quickly especially if you have the changing light mode on less than days of battery life with hr use 
0,i ordered the head blue cheaper set of head phones with mic the mic does not work for my ps even ordered second one because thought my first set was broken just junk guess
0,bought this for work and three hours after turning it on the mouse wheel broke and became unusable 
1,beautiful leds mouse works great 
1,we tried the charge too small for our needs extreme was too much base the charge is just right has lots of sound for an outdoor venue we are wanting to have music at yet can be turned down to still hear the clarity of the instruments the battery stays charged for days of playing definately hours or more we bought two to sync together for our outdoor gathering area we have been quite happy with this model 
1,it solid and well built and functions well the only issue is the short cord for the lights 
1,this speaker is great my husband uses it almost daily the sound quality is superb and the charge lasts long time we took it on camping trip and it lasted through the weekend on top of charging our phones
0,don buy
0,not worth it window to return is small broke in month 
1,the colors are bright and the mouse is lightweight their customer service is also amazing 
1,the headset has nice feel to it comfortable fit as well the audio is good as well 
0,all good
0,would recommend and would buy again 
0,this was replacement for another expensive illuminated keyboard which got wet findillumination and wireless operation to be very handy the fact that it is water proof or even water resistant is bonus it is not completely silent keyboard but there is very little sound key action is not quite as firm as mechanical keyboard but not squishy battery life remains to be seen but it is casually used daily for at least hours with no issues and only charged it once in week an charge indicator led would be plus so far it has performed very well and met expectations 
1,great speaker excellent bass for it size 
0,worth it
1,we have been extremely pleased with this mouse we have an hp laptop it works wonderfully with it 
0,the headset is really nice but the cord is like feet so its constantly getting stuck or tangled
1,my brother has pair of jbl extremes and they sound great outdoors didn want to go that big and expensive so after some research purchased pair of charge one from amazon with points and one from meijer store at big discount knew that separately they are mono but planned on getting two paired them with my iphone downloaded the connect app and tried them out in my breezeway and wasn terribly impressed but that room has cedar walls and ceiling and all hard furniture so moved out to the patio incredible sound played some aaron diehl tom waits jade bird several genres exceeded my expectations after listening to just one speaker would say this might not be what you want if you re going to use one solo would probably consider the charge in that case but if you connect at least two speakers for stereo sound you won be disappointed 
1,bought this for my wife that is not techie for her birthday and she loves it she is playing music from her iphone all the time can believe how good the sound is 
1,i purchased these to replace terrible set of headphones my job provided for remote working am not on the phone constantly so was not looking to spend time of my own money for work have three sets of beats for private use and while these do not compare for the price they are excellent they are simpler cancel noise as much as need and price was perfect they arrived in time and in good condition would not recommend for advanced gaming or hardcore users in need of studio quality products but for new gamer young child or someone looking to replace bad office bought equipment would recommend little else hat would do as good of job 
0,mouse worked great was easy to connect and use but stopped working and had to throw it away after months of use stopped charging stopped working all together 
1,i loved this product when first received it it lit up and lightweight and just pretty but that was very short lived it stopped working after just weeks of using it good thing it was on the cheaper side maybe it was disposable mouse that only was supposed to work for short period

0,its nice not having to buy batteries all the time for my mouse only downside is when don move the mouse for while you have to click the button to wake it up sometimes it clicks on the screen and clicks on something didn want to click on or open update it died months later not worth it 
1,has very loud buzz when using mic on xbox series controller other than that has great sound and bass but will have to return due to loud buzz when using mic for voice messages and party chat

1,my son loves it

1,this headphone fits my head so comfortably and allows me to be fully submerged in the sound the mic works great and have not found any trouble so far 
0,my son is using for gaming on ps 
0,i experiencing lot of glitches with this keyboard the worst is when typing text and using the enter key for line break and it just wipes out the entire app and loose everything ve never had so many missed types as with this keyboard contacted klim support and they requested short video of random glitch whoa my recommendation is to avoid this keyboard and klim as they try to be witty and cute and that not what you want when you have high priced cheap chinese keyboard marketed as premium product simply read the one star reviews for the truth on this keyboard 
0,like other reviews stated this mouse is super nice smooth and looks neat but lasted just over the day return window put it on charge for the th time since had received it and the blue light comes on indicating it is charging and goes off some time later indicating it is complete when you switch it on the red light flashes and then goes off highly disappointing

1,i like how the noise canceling was good quality and will last long time
1,i love this mouse easy to set up easy to use it seems to go forever on one charge and the ever changing light color is really cool 
1,this mouse works as advertised the changing lights on the side of it are what drew me in when browsing for new mouse on amazon don really like the slim feel to it feel like my hand would get tired after using it for extended periods of time also was looking for specifically usb mouse and to make this one work with usb you have to use the included adapter which ends up sticking out quite ways on the edge of your computer this is clearly stated in the advertisement just didn pay enough attention when bought the mouse 
0,i bought this item and it was echoing so got it replaced now with my replaced heaphone can only hear out of the right side terrible do notrecommend buying 
0,it felt like cheap product upon arrival and usage after months and no longer charges and is absolutely useless 
1,this is great wireless keyboard and it really quiet which sure over time and use the loud clicking will return that what my other gaming keyboard did anyway it feels comfortable it works great and enjoying it so far just wish the keyboard itself was little bigger but that my fault for not checking the measurements 
0,doesn recharge and the arrow on my screen moves very choppy and jumps around so half the time can click on what want 
1,good speaker good quality and sound 
1,good sound quality reliable connectivity nice weight love taking my music to any room in the house and outside 
0,worked great till the roller broke used times 
1,i originally bought the sony more bass model and swapped it out for this jbl the jbl blew it away sound nut and for the size of these speaker they sound great but two and pair them and get great stereo sound buy more than two and pair them all and the stereo sound goes away so ended up with just two of them and they are perfect be sure to download the app to get the stereo sound setting put one at each end of the pool and float away to great sound 
0,it always turn off after min use once this happens it works normal
1, great sound quality blocks noise great for gaming
1,nice quality for good price 
1,this came with an adaptor to fit the apple laptop but is not made specifically for apple products the charge does not last long and needs special adaptor prefer battery operated mouse as maintaining so many different chargers on my desk is cumbersome the three settings for on off are also less than ideal in summary while this mouse is aesthetically pretty it is not functional with the apple products 
0,this mouse worked ok for couple of months then it just won work anymore tried charging it and it just doesn do it waste of money 
0,item does not work

0,the wireless feature and recharging from computer 
1,i purchased this mouse for my daugyer and live that she loves it had wireless before but nothing compared to this one easy set up too would definitely recommend this mouse 
1,pro solid build and good looking sound quality good microphone worked as advertised and meet my expectations reasonable price con bulky for kid under years old but ok for adult usb light needed adapter not included but don use it so not big deal 
1,i use this product for gaming and online school the mic is awesome and sounds are very clear the blue lights are nice touch to the headphones it is well made and am very happy with my purchase would recommend 
0,you can use it for consle and still be able to have it light up as the cord where it splits to plug into both isn long enough of split might be good for pc but not for console
1,cute and functional bought them as stocking stuffers liked mine so much 
1,there is so much to say about this bought this for my mom and she loves it it has nice design nice feel to it and works beautifully well worth the money spent thumbs up 
1,product as described looks great with the lights ordered twice 
1,i was impressed they sound really good wish it didn have the usb plug for the lights but not big deal 
1,the headset is great it very comfortable the sound is really clear and can really go up it has great design and seems durable the only apparent problem is that people around me hear the voice bit but it no biggie for me 
0,i bought of this product for myself and my family all stopped scrolling just like that when my first one went bad borrowed my daughter and that stopped scrolling so did the other and we only had them for little over month when they stopped working there appears to be major defect in this product

0,this is little larger than the charge has longer battery life gets little louder than the charge but sound quality is about the same 
1,great speaker
0,once pulled it out of the box it sound worked but the mic did not peice of crap not worth the money
0,it beautiful but it literally stopped working after month it charges but when turn it on it shuts down right away 
1,i have to admit that am extremely pleased with this keyboard do game from time to time and it has performed exactly as expected mainly got the keyboard for coding though and it is the main reason now stay up much later at night to get the job done it is without doubt the best keyboard have ever owned the backlighting is superb and have yet to experience any strain from typing for prolonged periods of time it is very lightweight and robust and has already survived few water spills if you have kids rest assured that the keyboard can survive even their attention in nutshell then it is way better than expected for the price 
0,worked great for month then the center button stopped working 
0,it worked fine for month today days after the return policy window the cursor dosent work anymore and even with change of batteries 
0,the mouse seems to work fine and looks nice but arrived very dirty the box being dirty can understand due to shipping but the mouse itself has lint few pieces of pet hair and the track scroll is dirty as if it been used lot it was not described as used but very much appears to be and upset to pay full price for something that has definitely been out of the box 
0,looks good so far
1,works great out of the box shipping was fast dont really know what makes it gaming keyboard but it looks cool and feels nice on my fingers
1,this speaker is quite bit larger heavier than expected but the sound is incredible well worth it 
0,i bought two of these and both stopped working this worked great until it just didnt you cant even charge it anymore it will glow like it is charging and then nothing both of them died and stopped charging within week of each other 
0,this wireless mouse is very light and thin it can be used for long time after charging didn read the instruction at all just plugged the receiver which is hided at the bottom of itself into the usb port of the markbook air and it began to work normally it quite easy and quick to get start 
0,don buy this thought it would be convenient not to have to worry about replacing batteries was wrong used it one day and it hasn held charge since huge waste of money 
0,as the title states this headset worked at first after about two three months the sound became quieter four months later no longer have sound on the left side oh well not bad for about 
1,this speaker is perfect for outdoor or inside parties the bass is good the sound quality is excellent very good portable speaker 
0,good stuff
0,worked great the first week stopped holding charge and working after the second week sent back after month of having because it wasn worth the effort of charging to full only for it to work for hours if at all can even have it plugged in and charging while using so that wasn even possible work around bought different brand and have been using for few months without any issues don waste your time with this wireless keyboard 
0,not sure why my mice will run charge for several days on single triple battery but this keyboard dies within days of being unplugged basically leave it plugged in all the time now which defeats the purpose of wireless keyboard 
0,inexpensive fits over my ears so no ear pain like other headsets descent sound quality 
1,sleek and nice love the colors great buy 
1,so good for gaming the quality is so good highly recommend it 
1,perfect
0,this is the cheapest flimsy made in china item ve seen do not buy it never worked out of the box 
1,great mouse for work and gaming 
1,overall really liked the mouse enjoyed the colors and the feel of it was very nice the main problem had is that specifically bought it for work for my mac laptop the adapter didn work at all had to keep holding it down at specific angle in order to use it at all very disappointing 
1,this is fair to middling keyboard the back lighting only works when it is plugged in some folks think the back lighting is just gimmicky bling thing but in darkened room its necessary and if you go cordless no back light would rather have truly cordless model with lots of batteries prefer the heft this one is very light adding to sense of cheapness it is compact still room for improvement will try another when tire of this one still searching for the one would re order this ain it but still reasonable value 
0,do not buy it this mouse stopped working they built it enough to last few months so it out of amazon return policy after that it doesn work 
1,this product is very cheaply made purchased this mouse because my daughter liked the lighting on the side of the mouse however the wheel that controls how you scroll up and down on web page easily breaks off and you have to return it or buy another one buyer beware take it from father who has went through of them 
0,not good at all
1,this product is perfect am just using it as regular keyboard for my laptop but my gaming buddy immediately picked it up and was checking it out he seemed impressed with it and that was enough to have me sold on it the lights are great the keys feel perfect for typing as far as spacing goes the wireless is nice touch as well excited for years of use to come from this thing 
1,i have an xbox and the volume does work but how come my friends can hear me 
0,good quality sound system 
1,worked great for about weeks and then the battery kept dying faster and faster now it cannot even hold charge so it now rests in the garbage can 
0,i only used it once until it was dead and then charged for hours it wouldn even turn on have tried keeping it plugged in restarting my computer and trying the mouse on different computer and it still doesn work and now of course it passed the time to return or get refund even though it cute mouse it doesn work and frustrated

0,died within the first month of use nice mouse wanted to use it instead of the trackpad on the laptop too bad it didn work for long

0,the quality of these headphones are top notch
0,no speaker better

1,great quality and sound for the price
0,cheap product did not last long and wireless connectivity is horrible
1,i ve been on the hunt for gaming headset for while now and stumbled across these what really caught my eye first was the price of these can beat that and secondly the led effect sold me tried these out and think they have great noise cancellation and love that you can adjust the volume of it and it also comes with multiple cords to connect with many different devices 
0,you get what you pay for weak mic requires manual adjusting through computer sensitivity is low so you may have to raise it or scream into the mic 
1,this is newer model had the first gen it lasted for while then it stopped working love this because it lasts for long time and it sturdy

0,if you have an extremely large head then this is the headset for you mean round head like basketball or balloon shape head if you don don bother they re just going to fall off your head
0,quality and came with extra attachments
1,its nice to carry around as portable charger that can play music as for sound quality your better off purchasing the flip which outperforms the charge the only upside found was that the charge was better and deep tones flip for the win
1,really cool wireless mouse especially love the perfect ergonomic size and design and the cool lights 
0,muffled sound little dead for my liking
1,treat them with care for months and they re already broken only one side of the headphones work keeps going in and out super frustrating as gamer

0,i wanted something to take when playing sports seeing how big it was was expecting it to be at least little louder has the loudness of speakers half the size and quarter the price
1,i love this mouse sleek design and quiet clicks make it perfect will probably buy another one

0,good
0,really smooth soft click liked 
1,i purchased this mouse because it matched my laptop and seemed like it would look really attractive and cool when was using it it looked exactly like the mouse in the picture and was easy to charge and use it also held charge for long time which was really happy about the reason my review is so low is because my mouse only lasted for months and then it completely stopped working no matter what did certainly wasn expecting wireless mouse to last forever but it would have been nice to get at least months out of it before it died if you re looking for something cute and short term and don mind having to buy several mice every year this is the perfect purchase for you 
1,i ve actually purchased two of these and both broke in the same way the scroller do not recommend if you need them for any kind of gaming that requires the scroller need to use it for camera angles in game and without it gameplay is awful won be buying third one but if that not gonna be problem for you then these will probably be great they hold charge well and the light show they put on is really cool 
1,grandson loves him
1,great item overall but wish it uses usb to charge then micro usb 
1,i love jbl speakers my wife has had jbl clip for the past years and got this as birthday present to replace it and let me tell you the audio quality is phenomenal use it in the kitchen while cook and she uses it when choreographing dances it is great speaker and well priced jbl speaker will last long time too we still have the clip

0,it has endured for over year or so with no complaints or problems don cause from my end haven used the microphone due to laziness lack of need and computer issues so can review that part 
0,battery only last hours and not really that loud
1,i love this mouse the colors are beautiful and ve gotten many compliments on it it feels great to use as well took away one star because the charging cord stopping working about day after using it easily charges with any micro usb though it been couple months and still works being used every day at work 
0,everything expected
1,i love it
0,this is probably my second review in life because hate leaving them but very disappointed that the scroll wheel stopped working right after month of use don even use it every day hell don even use it every other day so this definite came as shock of course the return window is closed which go figure when you sell cheap mouse and the seller isn easily accessible like to think out of good character and business that would be able to replace this mouse as love the color and the lights on it but what the point if it no longer serves its purpose 
0,recommend it 
0,usb adapter doesn work and light on mouse fuzzes out when plugged into different computer that allows for usb 
0,i bought this mouse just over month ago and it has already stopped working awful product and waste of money 
1,the click isn loud but it does get picked up by my gaming computer recorder the battery doesn last near long enough not even whole day even when you don have the lights on it does feel nice in the hand it does track well but would say mouse pad isn optional with this one

1,great mouse for travel as it is very slim and ergonomic perfect for the bag that has just enough space when you re on the go and you need to pack up and move quickly it sleep mode feature is nice adage increasing battery life and usability as far as gaming goes would recommend only lite casual games only not for gaming on the heavy side overall would buy again
0,scroller is squeaky and makes noise seems loose
1,only thing don like about it is that the cable included in the package is only for charging rather than for charging and wired use you must use the wireless adapter for it to work not huge deal but it would be nice if wired use was an option it would make sense 
1,great sound comfortable fit 
0,the window passed to return used for week really need to press the buttons to get it to work irritatingbetter action on cheap corded board

0,this is probably my second review in life because hate leaving them but very disappointed that the scroll wheel stopped working right after month of use don even use it every day hell don even use it every other day so this definite came as shock of course the return window is closed which go figure when you sell cheap mouse and the seller isn easily accessible like to think out of good character and business that would be able to replace this mouse as love the color and the lights on it but what the point if it no longer serves its purpose 
1,i ve only had this for few months but not only is it really cool looking it responsive and comfortable to use 
0,this mouse has very poor sensor it will take several seconds to wake up after being inactive for bit and you sometimes have to click the dpi button or mouse buttons several times and shake the mouse for it to wake up the sensor also cannot move fast if try moving the mouse quickly the cursor gets very spastic and starts curving around the screen like deja vu is playing in the background speaking of clicks the left mouse button double clicks quite bit the only thing this mouse has going for it is its design even then the design is uncomfortable since its so flat find better mouse please don torture yourself with this 
0,it works nicely 
0,only owned it for weeks and all want to di is throw it in the trash it freezes all the time and it goes dead every hours
0,cant believe the quality for the price highly recommend this to anyone building either new office set up or gaming set up 
1,they sound pretty good and they feel reasonably comfortable but they feel cheap and the audio output is terrible the guys play with don really understand what saying most of the time so spent bit more money and got myself nice pair they re decent backup pair edit bengoo just reached out to me to refund the product if changed my review respect them trying to make it right but on the other hand don like review bribery
1,the lights are entertaining it works well and it survived the delivery driver squashing the package
1,love the slim design easier on the wrist the buttons have good feedback as well 
0,i purchase this mouse for my kid he had an old one using batteries only he is frustrated by replacing batteries so frequently every weeks like the feature including rechargeable and charge when you use it it really creates big convenience for children now he can stop looking for the new batteries around the house 
0,mouse is comfortable to use silent clicks however failed after only months of use use every day for maybe couple of hours at time turned off when not in use and plugged in when necessary died about week ago after having for only months would not recharge will not use rechargeable mouse again would rather use rechargeable batteries 
1,great speaker love that it links to other jbl speakers 
0,the sound for the head set is ok but not good or amazing in any way it hard to hear the people talk sometimes it sounds like they re far away or something it is also heavy on the cable side it feels clunky dealing with it
1,worked great at first with both my pc and xbox sound was way better than my old headset after one day it started having problems it either would not work at all or the mic would not work cheap chinese junk but did not want to spend ton on headset so rolled the dice edit bengoo customer support reached out to me multiple times and offered refund continued to troubleshoot the headset and got it to work with my xbox by buying new xbox controller the microphone still does not work with discord on my pc however changed rating to stars 
1,works great on my desktop good battery life and sleep mode works seemlessly good value recommend 
1,perfect budget mouse if your working with macbook like am very smooth and responsive but wouldn recommend for gaming because any crazy fast movement can kind of lag but for my online studies it been perfect very very long battery life don think ve charged it since bought it 
1,comfortable and easy to use the sleep feature is convenient because you do not need to charge as often 
0,i love the mouse it great fit for me it has options for both hands is quiet and the color ordered mint green is exactly what was shown what wanted the led lights run briefly when that option is selected but then seem to shut off thought they would run continuously maybe if use it for longer periods it could have an effect ll see what happens the biggest issue is that the usb adapter does not fit in my computer or my phone the little pamphlet that comes with the mouse says to contact their customer service email first with any questions problems emailed them the day got the mouse four days ago but so far have no response 
1,great set of gaming headphones my husband and my kids both agree this was good purchase like the design and it perfect for adults and children sits comfortable on the head and gives good sound and others can hear you as well when playing online very happy with this product 
1,works great well worth the price bought for my son and he loves it
1,it came quicker than expected the quality is great and the price is reasonable over satisfied with my headset 
1,great sound quality for the money cancels background noise perfectly really comfortable to wear product will buy again 
0,wasn able to use it because am missing the dongle contacted klim and am awaiting replacement dongle in the mail edit issue pleasantly handled 
1,i like this item lot very fairly priced and the low profile makes it easy on my hand don have the largest hands but not very small either and mouse with high hump is very uncomfortable this solves that problem nicely could do without the sleep mode am still getting used to waking it up and understand the value of sleep mode so deal with it never having to deal with batteries is also bonus charging it overnight is ideal but have already forgotten couple of nights and it fine if necessary you can plug it in and use it while it charges 
0,you get what you paid for this headset probably is good for gaming but bought it to use for my work video conferences and people complain about the quality of my voice over microsoft teams will need to get higher quality headset edit the seller contacted me with an offer of gift card if remove my review

1,we have two other smaller jbl speakers flip which we really liked but wanted bit larger one to connect to those to have full stereo effect and we re not disappointed in fact this one took over the top fav spot above the flip good sound good battery stamina good size

0, it is nice mouse but it is not changing colors it only shows red

1,works great especially like that you can have two bluetooth devices connected simultaneously

1,hs grad gift she says she loves it great sound range and quality the one to have 
0,i bought this product and after months of use it already won charge light up work biggest waste of money do not buy
0,i bought this because wanted portable speaker with an old fashioned aux input unfortunately the aux input has horrible flaw if couple seconds of silence go by in whatever you re listening too the speaker shuts off and only starts back up after it gets some signal again you ll lose about half second of audio as it turns on again too like let say you re listening to an album couple seconds of silence between tracks is enough to cause this and you ll lose the first little bit of the folllowing song because it shuts off and then turns on again only after something loud enough to turn it back on again happens so so annoying after little internet sleuthing found out that this is just how they are apparently you can fix it by shorting chip on the motherboard but not doing that returning it rip jbl really dumb 
1,good for gaming comfortable
1,this worked great for the first months and then it didn work at all didn use it daily sent an email to the one provided and never got response 
0,i like that it is lightweight and very durable and it is quiet can use it at night or early morning and not make sound 
0,can listen to music all night long and into the next day without recharging 
1,i never looked into jbl before this sound quality is amazing durability is top notch it is sleek and not to bulky have not tested out the waterproof part but think leave that for another time the battery lasts very long time like it says hrs it also great backup portable charger for my phone kinda wish got the bigger one just because really liked this brand this is me saying this not someone telling me to say it but if you like protecting your things would also get the carrying case will upload picture at another time 
1,i bought this for my significant other solin he uses jbl pa self powered speakers on stands in his recording studio and on gigs he perfectionist and he hears everything in music if speaker has too much high end it too bright he likes warm analog type of sound he loves the beatles and portrayed john lennon in beatlemania so he has heavy beatles influence on his original music my year old nephew visited with this jbl bluetooth and was delighted that solin loved it and he said of course it great it jbl we absolutely love this speaker great quality great price 
0,scroll wheel stopped working within days to long after return time all other features were good 
1,i initially liked this mouse because it cute it too flat to be ergonomic but that was okay except ve used it for less than month and the scroll wheel has fallen off its track it also dies very fast and needs to be recharged often don recommend it for anyone using mouse regularly 
0,a few days after the return window expired the scrolling wheel stopped working 
0,this product doesn charge at all
1,i disliked it because people on pc can hear their self like robot but anything else it good
0,there is lot of delay when we use numpad left shift doesn work as regular keyboards do may be this is intentional did not read the full description before buying unfortunately have to return this product sleep mode works so good 
1,this keyboard works well my only complaint is the lights go off very quickly when you stop typing other than that its easy to recharge and looks good on my desk top 
1,great mouse like the colors and how easy it was to connect to my laptop and tablet so can play baldurs gate on my tablet way easier now charging doesn take long at all either some with large hands may not like it to much it is bit smaller
0,pretty lights but when it sleeps you have to turn it off and wait ten seconds and turn it back on stopped working completely less than month after buying so now its light up paper weight
0,about weeks after return window closed quit working completely should have returned sooner as the charge lasts only about one full work day spent lot of time fooling around with mouse tool that should be something you don have to think about or make plans to be available for use going back to tried and true battery wireless which lasts about year and no hassle 
1,great all around headset for the price 
1,i loved this mouse for all of one month it connected and worked perfectly however after one month of relatively light use the scrolling wheel stopped working of course this happened right after the return window closed now back to square one 
1,absolutely love this speaker love that it has long battery life and the sound is amazing 
0,so got this for sitting by the fire at night with the family now take it everywhere need great sound ve even used in place of my bose speaker rate this 
1,perfect
0,this mouse worked one time and hasn worked since have tried charging it and flipping it to different settings it lights up and that is all that it does 
1,love it
1,very quiet and comfortable great response time 
1,i love the different colors easy to find at night holds charge for few days 
0,poor quality does not hold charge has sleek design but mouse does not work as intended 
0,at first it was great however after few months it just stopped working disappointing 
0,i ordered this mouse in april and it no longer holds charge 
0,stopped working day and half after got it ve charged it and everything and it just won work good for the couple of hours that did use it thought the lights were pretty so give it two stars for having pretty lights but no other stars because it was waste of my money since it no longer works 
1,excellent keyboard perfect size great lighting comfortable quiet keys rechargeable but it does lasts awhile before you need to recharge it good quality build very very good wireless keyboard 
0,easy to use and light
0,agree with what other reviewers said about the flat mono tone of iteration stick with the version returned and went straight to the se website and bucked up for the revolving sound you get what you pay for 
0,item must ve been defective or something because in was it stopped working charging and pretty much would my work at will also the returns process with this vendor sucks it not via amazon had to go twice to ups because had to print the label or pay to print on site then had to also buy an envelope to ship it back in if would ve paid little bit more for higher quality would thane had to waste more time and money with the hassle save yourself the grief and get one little bit more upscale 
1,there nothing majorly egregiously wrong with this mouse but it doesn necessarily excel at anything the mouse is pretty light the buttons are reasonably clicky and responsive the sleep mode is bit aggressive and find myself often annoyed with how quickly the mouse goes to sleep and have to wait for it to reconnect before using it again the dpi is by far the biggest problem it doesn feel like the dpi switch on the mouse actually does anything and it almost feels like the dpi changes randomly while in use ve noticed this behavior with mouse mat and on flat desk alone this may be just my unit but beware it nonetheless overall it definitely good enough for what needed cheap wireless rechargeable mouse that is passable for office work however wouldn use it for anything beyond that 
0,within couple of weeks from purchase the connection seems to cut out no one can hear me and can hear anyone trying to play video game not can you hear me now 
0,this speaker produces the bass that most small speakers don t
1,looks great comfortable in my hand
1,decent low cost headphones for gaming cool led but much rather put money into better audio quality 
0,they were only good for three months want refund
1,perfect christmas gift
1,it amazing so glad treated myself to this speaker 
0,everything
1,very nice for the price usually use it for about hours at time and the battery holds have put about hours on it and it still working fine it is simple light relatively comfortable and it looks sharp 
0,broke after nd use buyer beware 
1,so easy to set up and works great have had no issues so far it is perfect also because it comes with mac compatible connection port it has made my work sooo much easier it is smooth and easy to use love my new mouse 
1,this is the second we have one in the garage and this one in the gym easy to pair and use and great battery
0,we used these one time and they worked great we tried to use them again an hour later and they didn work at all waste of money my boys were so disappointed 
1,i ve been wanting mouse for while and glad purchased this one use it to game and edit my videos and it really comes in handy it better than than track pad and any other mouse in my opinion 
1,very nice love the different color light within the keyboard that light up when you are typing 
0,only have had this mouse for months and already have to replace it the charging port on the mouse no longer staying in place and therefore not charging the port is wobbling around not making contact to charge going back to battery operated wireless mouse 
1,best pair of gaming headphones my boyfriend has ever had 
0,does not actually work with anything remotely resembling modern pc it still has auto jacks
1,loved the change of lights and the fell under my hand great mouse 
0,after having this mouse for weeks it stopped working computer doesn recognize the usb and wont pair with it wirelessly this is the replacement for the original one that broke after being dropped short distance no way of contacting the seller very disappointed
0,it ok but getting the dongle out was quite the challenge not the greatest design on that part 
1,the headphones are very nice and noise cancelling great headphones 
1,really great headphones use them to play on nintendo and they work just perfect would definitely recommend
0,doesn hold good charge
1,i got sick of using my touchpad and needed an actual mouse for printing software trying to rotate and re size print patterns with touchpad was nightmare but this is great mouse for the price and has already made my life lot easier 
1,ok so just going to avoid beating around the bush and get right to it the headset is acceptable especially given the current pricetag but it not great it really not have sensitive ears had problems with them relating to heat and pressure so avoided headphones sets for while but eventually saw how for the world of gaming headsets dominate over earbuds so have been on the lookout for comfortable one ever since lil beating around the bush there know no more swear good the top headrest part is very soft and squishy we like this it blue love blue the cord is well made doesn look like it tearing anytime soon bad they re not that comfortable they re not torturous but have skullcandy headphones that are way easier to wear game sound is very average can hear decently but for games like fortnite that have bad audio to begin with this isn going to change anything ugly don know if this is defect but if you plug this into your phone or tablet and bend the cord lil while on call it ll hang up you watching youtube video cord moves slightly and it skips to the next video you see how infuriating this can be it pronged connection they have added usb connection only for the lights get it but at the same time just remove the lighting no one wants to have usb cord swinging everywhere when not using it on pc the mic doesn mute when you flip it up thought this was an industry standard but apparently not you have to manually mute your mic with the switch on the panel that dangles on your cord so that pretty much it honestly you be getting around the same quality with clearance pair at your local electronics store and without the very annoying end call bug would have returned but was too lazy eh it ll work as backup suppose edit bengoo customer service took the initiative and contacted me giving out refund to my amazement was concerned it was possibly scam but they worked with me to refund me without compromising any personal information whatsoever huge thanks to bengoo for having the service more popular companies should have 
0,when use it the pointer jumps around alot

0,i bought this mouse for work and it worked great the first month however after month it started working slower and slower and just stopped working not good use of money 
1,honestly all the hate for this headset is uncalled for this headset has all you need at such good price fits perfectly and has long cord and the sound quality is amazing wouldn be where at gaming wise if it weren for these headsets allowing me to hear almost everything on the maps
1,this mouse is very light almost too light since you don place batteries inside ultimately that why returning bc need mouse that can pick up easily also the led lights don look like the picture

1,i saw all the positive reviews and thought this would be winner at first it was great loved the colors it is easy to use but after few months the scroll wheel stopped working dug little deeper into the reviews and realized this is common theme now have to buy another mouse already and it won be another one of these 
1,these are pretty good if you aren looking for long term they work great but mine only lasted few months before just completely giving out randomly
0,plugged in and you can only hear if the cord is twisted while you hold it very disappointed and will be returning

1,love this mouse
1,i ve have bought this item two times it has lasted me since and has been great this is probably the best budget gaming headset 
0,not at all good sound is tinny no bass can see why ratings were so low thought that reviewers meant it was good but they re not pass 
0,quit working after weeks of use
0,i like it cause it is quiet 
1,the headphones work great can hear footsteps and other things clearly
1,overall great headset sound is great built well lights are bright has mute toggle switch on wire along with volume control was leery of getting headset with lights for only but these have been the best headset have ever used they arrived quickly and the box was in great shape when first took them out of the packaging thought had ordered the wrong kind because of the audio jack and usb hook up portion but after little bit of examination realized the usb was for the lights tested them on my phone first and oh my gods the audio is so crisp and clear play call of duty vanguard with these and can hear footsteps from across the map however still die due to my bad aim lol they work great on computers as well on max volume can hear them in my hallway when they are in my bedroom 
1,i got my headset few days after ordered it and it turned out that one side is not working so notified them and right then and there they replaced it with red one as requested because it just goes along with my computer no questions asked the headset looks awesome love the lights anyway besides the awesome lights this has got to be one of the most decent sound wise quality and most awesome looking headsets out there and for very sweet price mean price like that for headset like this is very cheap repeat the price is very cheap for what this headphone worth if you re gamer and do not want to spend crap ton of money for decent headset you might want to try this 
1,exactly what was looking for great quality and sound
0,ctrl shift left doesn work have to use ctrl shift right it is not the end of the world but it is annoying depending on the game you ll play some key combinations may not work also tried to use this for flight simulations which needs lots of key combinations failed even within less than ft from directly visible usb dongle this product misses characters while typing sleep mode and battery life is good but overall regretting my decision to buy this product 
1,i used these headphones mainly for gaming on my playstation but they worked just as good on my pc ve bought more expensive gaming headphones and these can compete with those except for the noise canceling but it not bad the long chord gives you room for gaming from distance and the volume control on the chord is nicely placed the led lights looks pretty nice and the fact you have an option to use them or not but still use the headphones is nice addition 
0,i returning mine after just months sound quality is bad sounds like the the bass is vibrating so crazy can hear what is being said and it is very annoying 
0,love it iv had it for about months now and can only recall time it went dead it wouldn have went dead if it weren for me neglecting to charge it but it left on for couple days other then that its great mouse use it almost everyday and only find myself charging it about once month 
1,i bought this cause its wireless and has come cool led lights works great no complaints yes would recommend 
1,it nice it lights up has good feel while in your hand stayed charged for good bit after the st charge however after it died the first time it doesn hold charge for very long now its not bad for someone who doesn use it daily constantly using my computer so it dying after days use is pain and don have time to let it charge for forever went back to using battery mouse 
1,the headset is very comfy in general and it fits on my head you re able to extend it and it pretty good the noise cancellation could be better but it still works the mic is little too short and the mic could be better the sound quality is very good but am unsure how good it is compared to other headsets it is good nonetheless and would recommend it very good for its price
1,i use this for work not for gaming the sound comes in and out in the left speaker but the sound quality is better than using my cell phone or computer microphone and speakers 
0,i returned the same day received very poor quality and requires cord to charge no battery
1,i bought this mouse for both my year old boy who is gamer and my year old daughter who we just bought gamer computer for so far this mouse is awesome we love the light up option on the mouse it enhances the gaming experience the mouse is lightweight and works great in terms of functionality so glad bought it 
0,the first day it worked great but the second day it barely tracks at all and when try and click on anything to open documents or emails it takes several tries before it works what waste of money going back to my old mouse 
1,i absolutely love this speaker 
1,this speaker had amazing sound with great volume also ordered it in pink so it just looks great as well the battery life is exceptional 
1,this product is little small for people with big heads but enjoy the sound quality and the base to me have tested it and it has quality sound 
1,liked the light up the noise cancelling could ve been better 
0,chord way to long spit part for lights doesn fit into series controller so its just useless kinda low volume mic is ok
1,love this speaker barely have to charge it battery holds up great we use outside at our pool and can charge my phone on it while using 
0, if you have big hands don recommend you buying this also with the lighting really dislike it if you look at the video it goes through the mouse and you can see all the the stuff inside very disappointed overall it good and sturdy mouse just thought they could ve worked on the exterior more 
1,after using game controller which was touchy and took forever to enter search information sprung for this great looking and easy to use keyboard the backlit feature is must and it paired perfectly with an xbox one console charging was snap and it just what you need if you re doing lot of searches on your preferred streaming services would be helpful if the instructions included more information on key functions 
0,the scroller broke within week and the material looked greasy and worn after about week of very limited use 
1,this mouse is perfect bought it to match with my keynote light up keyboard and it matches better than expected the colors change while gaming just as my keyboard does and it works perfectly for gaming and normal day to day use would buy again 
1,very useful play online games and it works for that very happy with my purchase 
0,works sometimes very unreliable waited too long to return due to trying different things so that on me had to purchase different keyboard 
1,i would have liked to control bass and treble but again sound quality is great 
0,on my laptop it skips doesn read about of the time making it unusable for gaming or pretty much anything that requires quick response time tried it on several types of mouse pads and surfaces and it does the same no matter what 
0,it decent but the power button was finicky and doesn turn on have to mess with it little feels kinda cheap but it will do for now
1,very comfortable to use love it
0,i purchased one for my desktop and one for my laptop received them both on june the scrolling wheel on one stopped working on july and the scrolling wheel on the other one stopped working on july 
1,this mouse was pretty great when first got it worked well went quite while without needing to charge quiet etc however months later it acting up almost constantly it skips around the screen and sometimes turns itself off like there an electrical short somewhere obviously too late to return but wanted to update my rating this wasn expensive but it shouldn act like it disposable 
1,its sleek the blush is cute color like the colored lights also works well
0,speaker sounds very loud and powerful 
1,great purchage very satified
1,best headset we have had so far durable microphone works well they are comfortable 
0,i bought two of them we didn use them every day but they both broke after months it is waste of money and you should not buy them 
0,good size and shape but unfortunately the scrolling wheel broke un the first month 
1,this is my second one to add to the one have great product that connects seamlessly with the other great sound and super durable
1,great for gaming my son loves them
0,i ve had this about month and it struggling to hold charge and the mouse is jumping there is also no option to return ll be going back to regular battery operated one as rechargeable is just not reliable dissapointed 
1,i enjoy the sound quality for the headset but please get the adapter for the xbox one controllers the headset fried controllers audio boxes unless used the adapter 
1,affordable nice feel good sound 
0,mouse works lgb died almost immediately the only color actively working on this mouse is the red led and the blue when charging when the mouse is left idle for minute or two it seems to desync and takes minute to wake up it gets in the way more often than not otherwise okay product 
0, the ergonomic feel of the mouse is great and the battery life is amazing it is lightweight and feels cheap white matches my setup but it translucent and takes way from the aesthetic it is connected less than ft away and it still loses connectivity which causes it to lag it makes it completely useless to me don recommend you buy it at least not the white one and be aware of the lagging 
0,the calibration on this is terrible can even use it it goes all over the place doesn go where im directing it to go make calls for work on my computer and it hung up when was clearly going to the opposite side of the screen it terrible 
1,purchased months ago and nothing to do but throw it away charging port is loose and won connect with cable flimsy and not made to last like nearly everything today the colored lights might be fun but better to pay for quality that doesn need replaced 
1,excellent product and works well
0,purchased and plugged in it worked for bit did computer restart then they never worked again returned them hours after they were delivered then went to brick and mortar store and purchased name brand 
0,battery life sucks
1,it cheap my right click requires more force than my left the leds aren that vibrant not ergonomic it decent mouse but wouldn recommend it for gaming 
1,i love the wireless mouse it hold charged in month even though using hours per day it is quiet and work great thanks for good product 
1,the sound quality is good for the price but it is not very comfortable headset all of my freinds were always telling me to get new mic and finally understood why after hearing myself on the mic it so loud with the most annoying echo have to hook up separate mic if want to play games with freinds and the headset just isn even that comfortable with the mic turn off option mot even working half the time it mostly what you expect for the price but ve gotten headsets as good for the same price so do not recommend honestly have no idea why this headset is so recommended it really isn that great at all 
1,we have used all name brand portable speakers this one is by far the best so far super clear and waterproof 
1,super quiet you just don hear any clicks love that it is rechargeable instead of replacing batteries have had it for weeks and have only charged it twice 
1,i ve had these for little over four years now and have had no problems with them at all mic is great sound is great volume control is easy there are blue lights in the headset that light up if you plug the usb portion in for power they are everything need want in headset edit ve used these exclusively with playstation xbox consoles over the past years with no problems but recently ve started using them for pc gaming as well and for some reason the mic does not work with pc sound coming through the headphones is still fine though 
1,mainly mouse youd keep at home on desk not really suited for travel battery life is great charged it once month ago and for being in highschool all of our work is on the chromebook and this mouse hasnt died yet
1,i think it good choice for starting out product it fairly good for the pricing and fits up to my expectations fits nicely and doesn hurt my ears like most headsets do 
0,works well with my dell laptop
0,product dont work
0,huge lag from keyboard to computer will just stop working randomly you have to smash the keys down to get them to register the key stroke if they even register it at all 
1,it responds very well and is easy to use 
0,why there no lights or showing if it charged or not have to turn it on to see the lights to see if it charge do you have to do that all the time turn it on to see if it charged or can you just plug it in and the lights will show if it when it going to be fully chargeyou have to turn it on to see the lights to see if it charge do you have to do that all the time turn it on to see if it charged or can you just plug it in and the lights will show maybe something wrong with mine please let me know
1,the bass definitely leaves something to be desired definitely proves why ve been fan of bose for so long bought this speaker for change of pace it no go for me personally 
1,sound quality is absolutely great for its size it can really fill space sometimes leave it playing in my room and go outside and it almost sounds like have whole mini hi fi stereo system in there the bass is very good but can also be tremendous if you position it right place it in corner where it can bounce the sound off the walls etc and prepare to be amazed it slightly bigger than the charge but probably the price you pay for bigger sound it really hasn affected the portability for me just throw it in my backpack and go it pretty durable haven dropped it but had paint droplets splash on it and was able to wipe it off with damp cloth perfectly and also sand etc comes out of it easily after day at the beach my only gripe is the single speaker that is contained in the housing is off to one side so sometimes if you re right in front of the speaker close enough to it you may hear bias towards the left side other than that totally excellent speaker never really charged my phone on it beyond few minutes but it works and the battery life feels super long especially if you re not playing it constantly honestly just excited now waiting to see how jbl is going to improve on this in future models 
1,great sound
1,i bought this mouse for both my year old boy who is gamer and my year old daughter who we just bought gamer computer for so far this mouse is awesome we love the light up option on the mouse it enhances the gaming experience the mouse is lightweight and works great in terms of functionality so glad bought it 
1,i love it could be tad louder tho
0,cancellation is good for the price sound is good ear holes are little small but the cord constantly wraps up on itself getting kinked and tangled 
0,this is good head set if you need something quick and cheap for gaming have kids ranging from to and if the younger ones get ahold of them don expect them to last very long they are cheap enough that just get new pair when they stop working they work well but are no bose headset

1,i ve used it only for times from jan to july now it won on don buy
0, the wireless mouse was great in the beginning weeks later it wouldn keep charge when it did charge it would only work if it was hooked up to the charger on my laptop meaning still couldn use it then would unplug it and lights started going crazy so would turn the switch off and on to try and use it epic fail waste of my hard working money then they only give you certain amount of time to return so basically it total loss 
1,got these for trip and was surprised at the build as well as the sound quality with the price of them the build could feel little better the ear cups creating better seal and the mic location or if it could move more inward other than that they sound great and feel comfortable 
1,its not too heavy it produces great sound the battery life is great and the controls are simple and easy to understand 
1,great speaker 
1,the headphones were great got them for my nine year old and he loved them overall good headphone
0,the product is cheap and worked well for the first months but after that it started becoming unresponsive would plug it in because thought it was low in power but that didn solve the issue either use lap top and have lap desk where it has built in mouse pad area ve had it for years so was thinking it was too old and worn down and the mouse wasn able to read it so bought new mouse pad but still nothing tried updating drivers with various programs tweaked bunch of settings and followed the advice from several websites nothing so disconnected it and brought out my wired mouse and it isn working either this product even disabled my track pad but luckily found way to get it working blame this crap product as it literally almost bricked my laptop
0,like the sound the look and the battery life last long long
0,currently returning this product even after adjusting several things on it this mouse just doesn do the job hard to click so when you do get click in it not where you wanted it 
1,i got this product days ago and everything was working great until wanted to use my mouse for different computer only to find out that the casing for drive was stuck in my computer and has no rendered both that usb port and my mouse useless the mouse is great in use but now cant use the mouse or the port until can find strong enough tweezers to get the piece out 
0,functional mouse but it is hard to click with fingers extra effort needed which is not good probably won buy this again 
0,what like about these gaming headphones is the sound quality you can hear almost everything
0,headphones are slightly uncomfortable to wear and the mic isn very good mine broke quickly after few weeks with seemingly no explanation that being said the sound quality is ok and these are ok headphones for beginners 
1,great price great sound can hear everything on xbox the headache part is the mic stops working st stop they replaced them now the replacement doing the same thing anyone else has this problem 
1,they sit comfortably on my head and they actually came ahead of time not to mention that they offer you really good deals 
1,i like the color and the changing light the sleep mode is nice and saves battery life when you are not moving the mouse 
0,the wheel is already broken only use it for office use and bought it about month ago very disappointed 
1,it very worth the prime day sale price and nearly worth retail selling price sound quality is very nice and can hear low frequency bass very well very easy to connect to and doubles as power bank if you need to charge your phone have not tested the water resistance but many others have look up videos testing it recommend this over other speakers in its price range but definitely get case for it 
1,i love it best mouse ve had 
1,i am very disappointed with this item had replaced it once and the same thing happened where it doesn hold charge after few months of ownership really like this product but the cool rainbow changing lights can only be enjoyed when its charged and working properly 
1,not horrible it just good basic gaming headset my old wired turtle beach headset still sounds better than this thing got that headset during xbox days and they are still better than this one sound wise it to be expected at this price point suppose you get what you pay for

1,for the price this object is probably my favorite keyboard have ever had it response great has had no issues using plug playing in different laptops plugs in and gets to working quickly so far have only charged it couple hours two separate times and have been using it for constantly playing games since bought it month or more ago so my battery life in my personal experience with this has been amazing recommend this product it is built much much better that the few other klim products have tested out well worth the money that is my two cents you do your research decide 
1,it works fine however sometimes it does not response when you move your hand also do not recognize when the dpi is activated or not also when you click the bottom it does not response so you have to press it more than one time for it works also it is felt very plastic 
1,i really liked this mouse but the battery runs out every few days wish the lights would automatically turn off after not being used for few minutes 
0,the battery lasts really long time hours while playing at medium volume

1,works wonderful son jumps up and down lot while playing so the extra length cord is great 
0,ease of use and portability
0,this head so it was not that company when first got it well the texture of it feels nice it seems like it doesn fit my head right this isn that tight on the ears doesn seem noise canceling another thing noticed while using this for gaming is if there are sounds one way you will hear it on all sides with no direction very hard to use and play competitively second issue have found with this headset is that it is very bad at picking up noise and have found myself yelling trying to talk to my teammates with them still barely being able to hear me returned it and do not recommend this headset 
1,cannot go wrong for the price buttons are totally silent and feel solid same with the scroll wheel not gaming most but ve had no problems with accuracy comes with slim usb port and pretty large usb port but it allows for usb passthrough which is neat can speak to battery life yet but it seems to have great power saving features so easily recharge with micro usb note this does not have bluetooth 
1,excellent gaming headset for my gamer works well on the xbox one gaming console customer service was exceptional bought as gift and so far nothing but delight from my gamer thank you bango for making my purchase worth my while 
0,the center scroll wheel broke in weeks for no reason mouse was not dropped and barely used garbage so you get what you pay for 
0,i bought this mouse so could have something rather than trackpad for college read the manual and did everything to get this mouse to work the softwares that are compatible with this mouse are older have the macos this mouse is only compatible with the macos if you re looking for mouse and you re in the same situation as me this one isn it 
1,i absolutely love this keyboard normally get just the regular wireless or plug in but never again can type so much faster on this keyboard it responds beautifully fewer typos even because it keeps up with me and the cool lighting is pleasing bonus 
0,works as mouse should work 
0,the mouse only works if directly next to the usb port it is plugged into so it is useless if using it foot below on keyboard tray the instructions are not in english to try and troubleshoot 
1,only had this for days so far like everything about it plugged it in everything worked fine use it on windows definitely want to keep it 
1,i travel lot wanted slim light mouse for work and school this mouse is perfect it fully charged in hours slim comfortable to use for hours when fully charged it can last for days also the changing light affect is pretty cool definitely recommend this mouse for someone who either works from home or is college student 
1,good headset for gaming love how the provide the splitter for audio in and audio out jacks on your pc so you don have to buy one for being way cheaper than the rest would say it great quality 
0,wish you could have the option to not have the led color lights on all of the time or way to just pick one and not have the constant circulation looks bad during the day
1,so the sound quality is pretty great but the mic seems to be picking up voices from the games play have to lower the dialogue volume if that is an option if not have to turn down the whole game volume to get the mic to not pick it up through the headphones perhaps if the mic was further away from the headphones but because it is so short it seems to pick up voices from games or videos really easily edit so the mute toggle on the cord does not prevent this audio pickup from the mic it completely stops my voice and sounds from my environment but it somehow is still picking up voices from games or videos even when the mute toggle is on 
0,it looks nice but after two months it did not work anymore the cursor did not move even it was fully charged not recommend it 
1,this product is everything that they claim it to be it has excellent sound awesome bass and is very east to connect via bluetooth it holds charge for hrs and takes just couple of hrs to fully recharge
1,works excellent prefer this mouse over the apple one 
1,my sister loves her mouse she uses it with her laptop 
1,so we ve gone thru quite few wireless items over the last few years this one by far has knocked it out of the park actually allowed my year old to pick her mouse this year she and she picked based on color read the description the review were good and the price was right so we hit buy now love sleep mode really love that it rechargeable battery lasts weeks like that it lights up when it charging and let you know when it done and an added bonus it the cutest shade of baby pink 
1,although we had quality issue with one of the laces the vendor fixed our problem and replaced the damaged laces happy to give it another shot and hope we have better luck this time 
0,i needed stereo for my boat what got is not only great sound but can move it anywhere want music
0,i liked everything about these until the microphone stopped working after only about month or so 
0,adorable little mouse however the darn thing will be on and won do anything know to click to wake it if it in sleep mode but half the time it won be asleep and have to click like times for it to start actually working unfortunately ll have to find another mouse because this has become an irritating inconvenience 
0,the volume is as high as the jbl flip it looks bigger but it not as high it was huge disappointment what the point of it being bulky if the sound is not high stick to the flip cheaper and sounds exactly the same 
0,the product is cheap and worked well for the first months
1,excellent wireless keyboard just what we needed 
0,nice the only problem ve noticed so far is it really hard to click the scroll middle button it just really stiff 
1,i loved it the sound quality was amazing and clear while my friends said the my mic was very clear 
1,easy light inexpensive quiet and perfect for my new mac laptop 
0,it work good but not great
1,headphones were great for my son the ear cushions were comfortable and overall the headphones fit great the other ones he had started to be too small for him he loved the lights and to be able to mute the mic from the headphones on the downside they only lasted him months at first the mic kept going in and out them the sound started acting up now have to get replacement at least these headphones didn physically fall apart like others have 
1,this speaker really sounds great good battery life as well 
1,very nice headset for gamers it is extremely comfortable for long periods of use itbworks great with my ps as well 
1,with virtual learning forced upon us we were lucky to have this amazing headset 
0,i especially dislike the fact that the rgb turns itself off after minute or so of no use purchased this keyboard because the one had did that if your playing game and using mouse or game controller then you don need the key oard much but when you do you can see which button is which until you strike key and activate the lighting what the point in rgb lights if they don just stay on guess ll be buying third keyboard but this time ll make sure it isn practically useless to me probably go newegg 
1,i love this speaker always use it and its amazing 
0,i was looking at this mouse when my cat jumped on my lap and hit the buy now button turned out to be pretty good mouse true story but she can write reviews so she may be little disappointed

1,sounds great and plays for long time easy setup too 
1,battery life is pretty good sounds ok
1,it okay my head is some what small and they aren loud enough if the volume went up it would be better thwy did not light up at all
0,i may have gotten defective product but the left and right click buttons rub together when clicking so you need to press harder than you normally would to select and without the click noise it hard to tell if you actually did select something ordered different one from another company and will be returning this one 
0,using with my new laptop

1,gaming on the switch works great 
0,bought this for my daughter as christmas gift we tried multiple times to sync it to her computer it would work for couple of seconds and then stop working return window closed and stuck with it made cheaply don purchase 
0,i was getting sick of my clickity clackity keyboard so went with this don game lot on it but haven noticed any input delay while playing fps my only gripe is the sleep mode is annoying because you can see the keyboard at all when it turns off sure you can change it up just haven bothered looking into it yet lightweight and sleek keeper for sure 
0, this product is not worth the headache the first mouse stopped scrolling after weeks of use returned it and days after using the new mouse am returning it and requesting refund the mouse doesn hold charge because there is red light around the whole mouse that is always on even when switched off the previous mouse wasn like this and worked well until it stopped scrolling now have to go to second location to return the mouse again they should reimburse the gas ve used returning this mouse probably spent more in gas than what paid for the mouse as you can see in the video it is off but the light is on turn it off and the light on then turn it off again and the light doesn turn off 
0,cool headphones
0,didn work 
1, when opened my mouse noticed there were scratches on the top of the mouse towards the area where your palm would rest when in use also noticed that the adapter that arrived with the mouse did not fit the usb that would make the mouse compatible with my macbook so had to use different adapter considering paid for new mouse was expecting to get better quality gave the mouse second chance and this time received one that didn work 
0,i hated this item they described how easy it was to use and received mine and it does not connect after doing my research on it its suppose to be compatible with my laptop and its not so now have to order different one im very disappointed in this product 
0,we connected correctly would not work after multiple attempts came broken 
0,i get it as spear mouse so didn start using it when get it it only worked for one day didn drop it or anything it just stop working update the seller reach out to me after seeing this review and agree to refund for the purchase 
1,i really liked this mouse being able to charge it and not worry about batteries was working great up till today tried to pull the wireless usb from the chromebook and it only partially came out the cover to it was still stuck inside the port had to use tools to get it out and now it no longer usable very upset have lot of work have to get done and using mouse makes it smoother to navigate guess this would happen just after weeks of the return window closing have only had this since the end of july 
1, in all honesty there is very little practical value added by colorful light changes for mouse but you know what in this time of the pandemic we can all use bit of quirky and interesting little patches of fun and joy especially visually this little mouse got the gold color because it was the least expensive at the time always brings smile btw it is quiet no noisy clicks the color is beautiful and classic and the feel is very ergonomic and no stress on the hand and fingers if you re still on the fence get one or more if you want to give yourself little and very useful treat 
1,purchased this for our laptop daughter loves it colors are great works good
0,they look cool but are for child or person with small ears had to take them off and go back to my old ones after min
0,i plugged it in to charge for hours the moment unplugged it it wouldn turn on and wouldn connect to my laptop but if it was plugged in it worked and connected wanted wireless mouse not something that needed to be plugged into charger to work im working from home on laptop and wanted something that worked but now have to wait longer for mouse that actually works

0,works as advertised
1, decided to buy mouse for my laptop for college really don like laptop mouse pads prefer the click mouse this one scrolls right left clicks and moves smoothly do use it on mouse pad which helps it move smoothly it works on hard surfaces like my desk but not as smooth would highly recommend this to anyone looking for mouse makes my online college classes easier ve been using this for out months now and only charged it twice has long battery life and sleep mode to exit sleep mode just click the mouse once can say ve seen any glitches that people are talking about maybe there were defective mine works great thank you

0,i work from home and work hours day depending if do overtime or not so needed mouse because my wireless mouse of years was dying now got this mouse in hopes it would work great because of all the reviews the first day got this mouse it was very uncomfortable so right off the bat knew didn like flat mouses because it was cramping my hand second the cursor was glitching unfortunately cannot attach video because it would be on company property and don have personal computer ll have it on one side of the screen and automatically it will go to the other if you like mouses like this and can deal with the glitching then that fine but for me hated it very frustrating 
0,pros wireless ease of use feels nice soft smooth sleek dampened click quietcons it has very loud scroll button the wheel works fine but the button is difficult to press down and is quite loud so it slightly defeats the purpose of quiet mouse no additional buttons such as back or forward additional you have to charge the mouse with the included usb charger

1,i bought one of these last year for one of my laptops and loved it so when the other mouses mice meeces whatever went bought more they are quiet and very easy to use this time forgot that the one usb connector was on the bottom so was ready to send back and exchange it but when went to pack it up saw it on the bottom thank goodness because really like them 
0,while the overall sound is decent for the price bought two speakers specifically for the party feature which is supposed to allow two or more of the same speakers to connect and play together ve had nothing but problems with that feature ve tried resetting per company instructions even sent them back and got two new speakers but the same problems exist if you want one speaker go right ahead but would advise against getting more than one 
0,have had this less than two months and it doesn work at all after hours of charging computer only recognizes clicks but no movement at all waste 
1,this product does what need it to do and does it perfectly super picky about stuff and can honestly say am very well pleased do believe have to turn it off for moment when it hibernates but that is whatever to me haha

0,the scroller doesn work mouse feels generic
1,i was hoping for much more sound than got mic is ok
1,the mouse is aesthetically very cute and does feel nice on the hand main issue is for both gaming and other computer activities the mouse will randomly jump across the screen which has never happened with any other mouse it led to misclicks ve deleted emails didn mean to because of it essentially just unreliable 
1,okay so ordered the jbl speaker because my mother day was coming up and my mom had always wanted her own speaker gifted it and it was working fine until like the nd month of having it it would shut off and on and it just won stay on even tho we ve charged it all night and still it won function so until get an answer back or way can fix this not so happy with it but other family members have purchased and came out fine so really don know what happen 
1,awesome and cool the color turns red when it time to plug in and recharge 
0,cheap quality and it broke quickly save your money for something more durable
1,i am writing the review on behalf of the comments made by my grandson he stated they are stellar feel so comfortable on the microphone works excellent he said he could hear things perfectly and keep the outside noise out the look is awesome he is happy to have upgraded to this headset was very happy with the price and quality would buy them again most definitely and highly recommend for their performance price and look of this headset 
0,nice look to it
0,was good while it worked used for basic office work nothing heavy scroll button broke despite almost never using that function 
1,i find this mouse easy to use fits my hand very well wear medium sized glove and moves fairly smoothly say fairly smooth because used mouse pad with smooth soft surface it seemed to drag just little when tried smooth hard surface it worked better you do have to click button to wake up the mouse when it goes to sleep mode my other one woke up with just moving it thought that maybe the changing lights around the mouse would be distracting but dont even notice it would probably buy again 
1,awesome product was carefully retrieved from our inventory with sterilized anti bacterial gloves and placed on satin silk cushion team of experts then proceeded to inspect your product they polished it until it shone bright and bid it farewell with tender caress then delivered quickly using two euro fighter to escort and insure its safe arrival upon inspection understood why klim took so much care and pride to provide this kool gaming keyboard have enjoyed using it right out of the box without any problems klim offered me email support to answer any question about using their product my only question is how did they managed to evade our fs thanks paultip the klim chroma wireless has light modes breathing constant and off you can change it by pressing fn pause break you can also increase the luminosity by pressing fn page up and decrease it with fn page down 
0,goes through batteries like water
1,the scrolling wheel doesn work my daughter was so excited to use this but it won scroll other than that cute mouse 
1,i really like this mouse super easy to connect and the charge lasts forever swear charge it once every weeks and leave it on by accident all the time but the sleep mode is great recommend 
0,exactly what was looking for lake side bike rides
1,it was awesome definitely buying in the future again loved the noise cancellation 
1,wasn expecting much because it seemed low priced but have been using daily for work for about month now and it wonderful no issues actually bought two of them one grey and one gold and they both work fine 
1,very good quality and great sound 
0,it very nice
1,this thing is awesome everyone at work has asked me were got it
0,mouse only last hours after charging 
1,the product was great received exactly what was advertised such as noise cancellation the quality of audio is superb and would definitely recommend to anyone looking the better their gaming experience 
1,love this mouse take it anywhere it classy yet little sexy for my workspace it very adaptable to who needs it in my house for their devices 
0,my grandson gammer 
0,i love it when first got it but now it has stopped working 
0,i bought of these one stopped working months in and the other stopped months in of course it too late to get replacements 
0,it works ok nothing spectacular if you re gamer or use the mouse quite bit you have to charge it about once day or it starts lagging and causes things to crash or freeze up due to the lag 
1,super loud plug in cover flap to make it water proof love it 
0,the wires are flimsy around the audio jack and mic jack to the point that you have to adjust them specific way to get sound to come out of both sides of the headset accidently move the wire and you have to try to readjust it 
1,this is great keyboard the keys are quiet and don travel far when pressed down it lights up well enough to be seen clearly in the dark and despite being make out of plastic instead of aluminum it seems fairly sturdy that said this is not the keyboard for me an old school computer programmer and am on my keyboard all day long prefer loud clicky keyboard reminiscent of the old ibm pc keyboard this keyboard is nothing like that it extremely quiet and the keys don travel far when pressed was looking for borderline typewriter feel this keyboard is more for gaming and such again this is great keyboard and clearly matches its marketing it was just not the keyboard was looking for 
0,battery won stay charged very long
0,worked for single week before it stopped typing 
1,i loved my first one gave it away to friend and ordered another using the amazon buy again the next one was about inches bigger in length and about an inch larger in diameter seems like they shouldn have called it replacement 
0,the usb break apart and could no longer use the cordless mouse ugh
1,my last headset lasted me years and finally died on me orded this one thinking it looked good first off the mic isnt curvable to so cant put it closer to my face and its to far so now its half way on my ear so can move it closer to my mouth my friends can still barely hear me when im not speaking loudly and this is problem since have year old that sleeps near me ive also listened to myself and sound like im inside of can the only postive could find is that its really comfy and the sound quality is ok ill be sending this back tomorrow and ordering another rig headset since they clearly understand whats needed to make good gaming headset 
1,it great ergonomic mouse for gaming 
0,the fact that you can keep the lights always on totally defeats the purpose of buying this product for gaming and night time using the lights turn off too fast if you are not constantly typing something even at their longest settings and you can select just one of the five colors of the leds so you are stuck with the rainbow lights also it not that very quiet compared to an old mechanical keyboard have it only about quieter hate the fact that thought was buying an american product because of the american flag on their main advertising image on it front page but it made in china 
0,rechargeable comfortable haven killed it yet use it at work haven killed the battery but charge it overnight lasts the day for me
0,i was very unhappy with this product it was way too complicated to connect to the pc returned the product and still having problem with the new one received instead 
1,i could not get it to play the chat audio and the gameplay audio to both works at the same time but think it was problem with my xbox and not the headset the headset itself was great the price is considered it is an amazing deal 
1,love the lights 
0,did not receive the correct cable to charge 
1,this mouse is very sheek and love it because the clicker is quiet however its bit flat and take some getting use to 
0,i do you like it so far but it started to come apart at the seam put it together bit concerned if it going to just do this again must be due to quality have been very careful with it
1,i ve been around music my entire life including spinning records at top nightclubs where jbl was the speaker of choice really wanted to love this speaker but it not happening jbl should be ashamed of themselves the sound quality is horrible the speaker clips at between and of the volume using my phone at way the speaker music coming out is missing everything including clarity bass treble yes stereo everyone with reviews complaining about dead music coming out is absolutely correct the speaker plays dead music especially at higher volumes anyone wanting cheap portable speaker with horrible sound this is for you anyone looking for great speaker this is not for you yes you get what you pay for but with today technology every speaker should sound great take look at the marshall bluetooth speakers they re amazing also if you don need portability the klipsch speakers are amazing sonos is overrated find myself always going back to the good old names from decades ago even the bose speaker selling for around on sale right now at bb sounds better than these jbl speakers folks take look at the bose marshall bt speakers you ll really enjoy the sound especially from the marshall woburn ii have the bose soundtouch the speaker blows away every speaker on the market also had the marshall stanmore hooked up to my phone and computer it rocked if you can find the old bose acoustic wave in mint condition that was once an amazing speaker too hope this review helps you thanks for reading it 
0,seriously the worst keyboard ve used in years of pc gaming including novelty keyboards micro keyboards that fit in one hand keyboards from the with the pin conectors this keyboard shuts off and disconnects from the dongle often and repeatedly even with clear los of the dongle it will not stay connected only buy this keyboard if you want your character to just stand there and die while you furiously mash buttons though that by putting couple more dollars in than the minimum could avoid products like this but am disgusted with the product quality here would return this product if didn intend to smash it with hammer when but an upgrade this week in sick attempt to reach some sort of closure on how awful this products is do not buy this keyboard 
1,works as intended the lights are pretty but bit bright use it from across the room with no issues and the battery life has been excellent even with me forgetting to turn it off 
1,everything seems great so far 
1,i got this for my mother and she loves it 
1,alot of people said the mouse was loud didnt work or what ever else its false the mouse is super quiet my mouse at work is loud and obnoxious this isnt the colors are great was sad cause it didnt turn pink lol but that is my only complaint its great mouse some of yall expect way too much from something cheep you get what you pay for but this mouse is great 
1,omg ve my speaker it better the cheapest speaker have in my backpack that cheap one whack and the jbl speaker is way beyond better ve it so much thanks amazon 
1,love this bluetooth speaker 
0,no instructions in english sleep mode no ideaworks fine and the color changing is cute
1,i bought this mouse on august it worked well for while but today september the mousewheel spins freely while my screen does not scroll you get what you pay for and guess with this you re only paying for mouse for month and half 
0,don expect the bluetooth to work it didn work for my device but it works as mouse tried it gaming not the best recommend spending the extra cash for good gaming mouse but if you need or want mouse for clicking and dragging go ahead but the lights don turn off and again the bluetooth didn work for me it might work for you who knows 
1,ok the good small company like supporting that great packaging they have an insert that tells you about the team that designed the keyboard the construction is solid doesn feel like junk well made what could be better the brightness of the colors in the photo is not what you are going to see in the product you can see the colors but it not very bright this is simply light behind the keys but considering it connected to your computer it should be brighter because it has continuous power source what is jeez not good the key placement it off understand that anytime you get new keyboard that your fingers have to learn where the keys are but as large as this keyboard is it should be spaced just little bit better to standardized keyboard the return is way off am keeping it because it matches my mouse and it pretty know my fingers will eventually learn to reach yes reach for the return but right now it sorry just blows the product has potential to be super amazing and have no doubt they have production crew willing to get it there which is exactly why took the time to write an honest and detailed review 
0,worked fine for about months then wouldn charge again after it died 
0,i bought wireless keyboard so could play feet away from my desktop it looses it connection often from this distance its pretty frustrating 
1,control shift doesn work saw this in other older reviews but this was supposed to be new version of the keyboard so hoped it was fixed nope before all the other features backlighting ergonomics etc keyboard needs to allow you to press keys and have those keys go to the computer use this combo constantly for work to login to sites as different users or without cookies not taking what type and send it to the computer is non starter for me even if you don use this combo lot there might be other combos that don work and just out of principal don think it good idea to support product that doesn actually allow you to type something and have it go to the computer 
1,this is an amazing keyboard silent keystrokes backlit that isn blinding or distracting super high quality and the best part of all it rechargeable 
1,it works very well got it as gift for my boyfriend and he loves it
1,the only thing dont particularly like is that it feels cheaply made and isnt the snuggest fit but it works wonderfully in all other regards 
1,this is by far the best speaker ve ever had sticking with this brand for while 
1,battery last great for kid to use 
1,sounds good charge lasts long time really like this product it has gotten wet and continues to work like champ

1,this is my first headset and it definitely seems to get the job done my voice carries through the mic and the sound is great 
1,a pretty nice headset for anyone trying to go for one cheap 
0,this is good looking keyboard it is wireless with short usb charging cable it can barely reach from my desktop to the usb port in the front of my computer also wfh like many of us right now tax accountant and have to have accuracy in everything type this keyboard has lag doesn matter whether its on or off the charger type wpm and it cannot keep up due to the lag it also misses many digits from the key keypad due to this lag had an unnoticed typo in zip code for an irs form my new boss was not happy missed this which of course shouldn have except for the lag and almost lost my new job when the keyboard is not being charged it will start to freeze and lag and generally miss numbers and letters then realize need to put it on the charger so plug it in and its working ok then next thing know an hour or so later it starts doing the same thing again so need to take it off the charger then another hour or so it does it again now need to put it on the charger terrible ve never had such problem with charger before ever wanted to return the product as it was not cheap but looks like have no option for return purchased on and with the hullabaloo of starting new job hadn realized was slipping out of the exchange and return window don waste your 
1,good mouse can use for working at home ordered the rose gold which is pretty cute for desk decor and the lights are fun it functions well and it quiet when you click which is great
1,i had wireless keyboard before purchased this one it lagged while typed and sometimes would have to sit for half minute before could start again love this keyboard it does everything need it to do love fact can charge it and never needs batteries to be replaced

1,very nice quality both in sound and rugged design construction big sound even in large room battery lasts long time easy bluetooth connection to my iphone works every time with no hassle typical bluetooth range its fine as long as the phone and speaker are in the same room almost all bluetooth things are that way unless they have stick antenna and cost lot 
0,the mouse never worked am very disappointed 
1,this is great my son loves them
1,i got this for the bass which delivers as promised it may be mono speaker but it doesn sound like one and you can always get second and pair it clear sound plenty loud amazing bass for its size very happy this product 
0,first of all none of the cords work plugging it both into the playstation controller secondly in order to talk in here you can do it simultaneously you have to change it each time course this would be pain in the ass but it never works garbage returning it tomorrow want full refund in the premier brand
1,great all around headset
1,i using microsoft edge and was concerned this keyboard won work after reading the compatible os but simply plugged in the usb after charging it and it went to work right away love the lighted keys although not gamer just for working late at night for the price give it stars 
1,this unit works perfectly for what needed can bluetooth music over the air or wire into the aux to mix music in daw in real time without bluetooth latency went for the charge specifically for the aux so far no issues recorded track today with key midi keyboard and the headphone out of my computer to the charge works like charm 
1,this works well for my son xbox series he likes it would have given stars if the usb cord that is to inserted into the port on the xbox was longer because that cord is so short he not able to experience the blue led while playing 
0,i ve enjoyed using this keyboard but one big problem seem to be running into is the battery life have other wireless keyboards that will last week before have to recharge them using this one for about the same about of time have been having to recharge it multiple times week not sure if the backlight is draining the battery that much but that seems like major difference some of the keys sometimes stick or don seem to respond unless you press them very hard 
0,title says all good for the price but the usb is literally for lights only and the mic mute button doesn work as basic generic headset though 
0,not the best fit
1,i could afford way more expensive keyboard but honestly love this one
0,it isn waterproof it just false sense of security went awhile without spilling anything on it and just last week spilled water on it turned it off right away kept it off till it dried up and it completely done bought water proof keyboard cuz it supposed to be water proof 
0,the tracking ball wheel stopped working after couple of months thinking broke the tracking wheel ordered new one and it arrived with the same issue straight out of the box it works fine if you don mind not having the tracking wheel 
0,the mouse wheel broke and just spins now used this for my work laptop and loved it but if this is the quality it is will not buy another
1,these were in my desired price point dirt cheap and they have exceeded my expectations bought two pairs so my kid and could play co op missions on the switch together the noise cancelling works pretty well although definitely didn buy them for that feature microphone comes in clear and the volume knob and mic mute button are easy to reach very impressed 
1,great item for my year old gaming 
0,the charge port messed up not even month later super disappointed
1,head set came quickly and was great for compatibility great value for money
1,great speaker loud for its size
1,very good works perfectly good as dollars one saves you money and gets job done noise cancellation awesome
1,love it 
1,great works good
1,amazing my father loved it for the poolside easy to connect and has long range so it doesn cut out when people the music player walks inside with their phone to use the bathroom ten out of ten 
0,i have only used it for few months and it already broke when dropped it on the floor it too fragile 
1,great buy more than hoped for at this price
1,recently purchased this mouse the look of the lights is cool not fan of the sleep mode but did love the smooth feel of movement and the track wheel was perfect however after day and half went to charge it and it never came back on thought it needed to charge longer but no just stopped working 
0,bought this for my son to use for school the roller bar broke the second time he used it in addition to this it wouldn stay charged dissatisfied customer 
0, ve only had the mouse for one month it no longer wants to charge have the matte black mouse and the paint is peeling off 
0,good headphones
1,this mouse is wonderful to use for precise things such as line drawing and making flow charts it is super comfortable to use unfortunately bought this at the beginning of the year and now it will not charge so basically now have corded mouse which is what needed to avoid so until find highly rated cordless or battery operated one will be tied to the computer literally 
1,okay so cannot answer honestly about the gaming capabilities of this mouse my husband is the gamer can however let you know about my general usage opinion first off it pretty love the color and love that it lights up on the sides there is setting on the back that allows you to turn off the lights to save battery drain ve been using it for days pretty consistently and haven needed to charge it there wasn any software or drivers that needed to be installed in order for it to be used just plugged in the small usb and it immediately worked that all can say at this point since haven had it that long will update this review in few months and include any issues may experience and any new opinions develop 
0,this mouse was very dissapointing it was hard to use and finally after couple of months it broke completly 
1,excellent range and sound quality
0,my kids luv it
1,sounds great purchased the flip couple years ago and wanted more sound quality this thing is awesome 
0,this does not go loud at all was lil bummed 
0,i have charged it and when unplug and turn on it flashes red then nothing tried turning off on and sitll nothing dongle is plugged in to laptop correctly if there is no tip to fix will be returing 
1,love it
1,worth every dollar these earphones have great sound feel comfortable and are great as far as the price would definitely rerecommend them 
1,high quality head phones excellent product highly recommended 
0,this headset for gaming is one you should get it does not cost that much and is worth it say if you are looking at it just buy it because it is worth it 
1,wanted this for living room computer put the wifi reciever into usb port in back of the pc by my tv and if use the charging cable that came with it got further away than using the wifi component it seems which means you get between ft of range for anything other than using it across room it does seem responsive easy to use and other wise great keyboard but if you want to sit more than ft from your computer you may want something else 
1,a pretty decent headset bought this headset having very very high hopes for the mic specifically since my audio hadn been the best just through my laptop microphone but after using this headset for month or two have realized that the mic isnt actually that great it is mediocre at best and it commonly cuts out in voice calls the headset audio quality itself is honestly pretty good the mute and volume wheel were very convenient and you could really make your audio very loud with the volume wheel which was plus will say though that the led lights on the headset wont light up unless you plus the usb jack in which was big inconvenience for me when was still using wired mouse and after reading the reviews they rarely add that note but maybe just forgot to check the slides when buying this headset is also very very bulky which is personal ick for me when buying headsets its definitely not for minimalistic look but will say this is just personal preference overall its mediocre headset since its only you get what you pay for but theres definitely better headsets out there for the same price or save up just bit more money for highquality medium priced headset like the razer kraken steelseries arctics or hyperx cloud alpha headset 
1,i love my speaker got it days ago will update yalll
1,i use this for work and it is great exactly as described with both usb and jack for my laptop the wire is super long so can get up from my desk when using and the padding on the earpieces is super comfortble

0,does not work don waste your time 
1,feels like surround sound theater granted ve never used an expensive set and have only known the sound quality from free earbuds that came with my phones but for the price this is great foam paddings are also really soft 
0,volume control doesn work on this keypad
1,best speaker out there battery life lasts forever and the sound is amazing

0,my husband likes these so much this is the second pair we bought one for me now
0,i professional who writes lot and thought on giving this low budget keyboard try it is not suitable for heavy writing work as it becomes really heavy on the hands after few thousand words it is however well designed keyboard that can be used for simple daily computing 
1,great sound very portable looks great and sounds great 
0,the user guide and charge cable did not come it was supposed to 
0,it was easy to install and worked the first time 
1,i bought this mouse recently for new laptop bought and it is perfect the mouse is an extremely portable wireless mouse it actually feels very comfortable while using it theres no side buttons or extras on it just simple portable mouse that cna connect via usb or with the included usb to usb adapter recommend this mouse because of the price and what you get for it 
1,st off this product advertises as if there are lights on it there aren its just sticker that doesn have any led function very misleading nd the headset is very poorly made the earpieces barely fit my year old they are far too small to fit an adults ears rd the sound quality is subpar takes lot of adjustment and you get better quality from an xbox default headset do not buy this 
1,using for work meetings and for music pretty good quality for the price 
1,unfortunately had to return it it cute and true the color however it does work for my laptop
0,i am just past the return window and of course this doesn work anymore have barely used and haven had that long

1,very good choice for your first pair of gaming headphones the sound is perfect and the mic quality is very clean doesn hurt your head after being worn for long time either 
1,great range finally we found wireless mouse that works well we use this for television viewing we have our laptop attached to our television we are good feet away from our television and laptop when we use this mouse again it has great range easy to use and works quickly highly recommended 
1,arrived very well packaged with special note included that made me laugh worked immediately out of the box and have not had single issue with it so far had it about week

0,was enjoying the use of the mouse until one day the usb stopped being recognized 
0,i was looking for simple black led mouse for work and this one is exactly what was looking for it works great and have had no issues yet due to the size it can be little uncomfortable if you are doing lot of work using the mouse for an extended amount of time but this has only happened to me once 
0,jbl speakers are trash when it comes to battery had the jbl xtreme and the battery wouldn hold charge it had to be plugged in to use it finally threw that one in the garbage and bought the charge three weeks in and the speaker won charge at all the sound quality isn that great either sucky bass and only has one speaker on the right side it not worth what it costs this speaker should be no more than returning this crap and gonna look into better speaker don waste your time

1,this keyboard is great the room work in can get pretty dark and the backlit keys are so fun and functional the usb cord broke and asked customer service what should look for to replace it and they sent me free one free of charge had another keyboard that used while waited for the cord and this one is so much better the keys feel good and can type fast without missing letters great value great keyboard and great customer service 
0,it flimsy and the battery doesn last long you constantly have to charge and you can put batteries waste of money
1,works perfect just notice the volume font not work from keyboard tho 
1,i hated using this mouse it was beautiful and matched the color of my laptop perfectly but couldn get the cursor to move smoothly adjusted the setting on my laptop but ultimately ended up getting different mouse which worked perfectly 
1,for gaming it is really good and the noise is perfect can hear it very well 
0,after receiving this mouse charged the mouse per the instructions on normal rate usb charger non fast charger this took little under two hours for full charge the blue light goes out when fully charged installed the usb receiver into my computer and the mouse was recognized immediately on windows the mouse seems to work smoothly and the mouse pointer is swift you can adjust pointer speeds if it is too fast the mouse lights up around the sides when in use it is bit quirky but it doesn bother me also the mouse will go to sleep if not used for certain period of time probably to prolong the battery charge to wake the mouse just move it or press button overall it is decent wireless rechargeable mouse 
0,this broke after weeks poorly put together 
0,plugs didn work for computer or phone very quiet when they would work

1,this is an awesome little mouse connection was super easy it quiet as mouse and compared to my last mouse silent the buttons work great it feels really smooth and think the size is perfect for me 
1,needs better battery life but overall good wireless mouse great customer service but they will contact if leave bad review 
1,easy to use great on the hand good product 
1,i love the jbl speaker so much it works so good and just love it all around it very great speaker the connectivity is little slow but that doesn stop me from listening to my jams 
1,very easy to set up works perfectly fine with my macbook air 
0,i like this keyboard it last longer than my mouse this keyboard last days for me before charging
1,it often stops working at random points even with full charge there will be sudden fits where it won respond for good seconds or it will be super laggy with its inputs was an idiot forgot it had warranty and bought the first one at least had the courtesy to wait few months to bug out day this thing bugged but like the feel of the keyboard its damn satisfying keyboard when it works the buttons are nice to press and the keyboard feels nice in general that why bought another hoping the first was faulty the lights are nice also but sadly cant recommend it if keyboards have similar bugs hell even typing this out was an ordeal especially when was listing the positives of it will be sending it to repairs but really hope they straighten this problem out 
1,love these first timer with this brand and am very happy with the sound quality and comfort of this headset cord is very long for my use on ps but prob very helpful for pc users
0,it works really well
0,i have had this mouse for less than months that and the rolling ball has stopped working that sucks 
1,i can say enough good things about this speaker after months of heavy use at home and outdoors it still looks and sounds like new it loud enough to use at parties yet small enough to carry around the battery seems to last forever listen to it all day and use it to charge my phone only have to charge my speaker once week 
1,it functions very well as wireless mouse the usb adapter it comes with is very handy for the new apple computers which only have usb ports the lights are cool as well but more importantly the mouse is sturdy and doesn feel cheap 
1, sooo this thing is so cute for starters it light weight and without my mouse pad it smooths across surfaces easily the buttons aren hard and actually it easier to click on different things only negatives have when it goes into sleep mode have to turn it on and off and the second thing is pro and con for me the usb chip to make the mouse work wireless is stored under the mouse love it because it makes traveling with this mouse for work super easy just wish it had latch release had to use card to pop it out other than those things it great didn even have to charge it when took it out the box 
1,here are few major issues bought this keyboard for main reasons it was supposed to be ergonomic silent lit up and good qualityergonomic this is not ergonomic it black ordinary keyboard with some lights silent keyboard this is not silent it is the loudest keyboard have had in years lights thought you could decide what lights shine through the keyboard nope you get to pick how bright it is and whether it solid breathing flickering or off the color pattern never changes the worst part is after seconds of not using the keyboard all of the lights turn off which is really problematic when it dark and you are relying on the lights to see they letters quality it feels like cheap plastic overall give this stars would not purchase it again 
0,the charger was real pain my kids stopped using it the nd week
1,i love itttttt

0,at the start noticed that they weren that loud even with the volume on ignored it though because it wasn that bad regret doing that because now they got even lower with the sound on this product isn worth buying 
1,ordered this for my year old son the second he opened it he could tell it was junk but he tried to give it fair shot both my boys are really big into gaming and they said that this is pier crap the microphone doesn work at all he can talk to any of his friends return it but my time is more valuable than this item if your kid is little and he doesn have any friends to talk to this might last week or two but besides that he was pretty upset wouldn buy it if were you had to order him different set so just my opinion if you don know what you re looking for don get this mom doesn know 
0,i liked the size and ease of charging but very dissatisfied with the lack of reliability and of course both stopped working just past the point could return waste of money useless without the scrolling wheel 
1,still cant figure out the connect feature but super great speaker on its own the power bank is sick 
0,this mouse came in handy when needed it most after my other one came up missing

1,great sound
0,i ve had this less than year it been wonderful but is starting to get skippy glitchy to where it unusable it shame it nice colorful quiet mouse but evidently not made very well 
0,wanted to like this since it was cheaper for wireless keyboard with backlighting with in month or of normal use the letters and numbers wore off that could live with but then the one of the shift keys broke in half and made this unusable again this was with normal office use no gaming no smashing keys 
1,i was extremely disappointed to find out the charging adapter didn come with this speaker it expensive enough you think they include like they did for my charge got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and one of the things he loved about the aesthetics of my charge was the vibrant charger an adapter is something of users will need why omit that great quality but give this star for skimping on the charger 
0,my family bought of these for our twins in less than month one of the mics broke the other set had one of the ear speakers break after only week so disappointed 
1,i bought this for my son who uses them for gaming and watching videos on his ipad he loves them and they are very comfortable they work great and the sound is good too
1,the mouse is comfortable it easy to click it doesn get stuck or it isn too loose or too hard the mouse itself is good size for my hands the colors are very vibrant and pretty they are soothing to see thank you for the complimentary mouse pad it was thoughtful 
0,do not buy this mic someone who always checks reviews with this device check the questions apparently you need an adapter to use the headset in the first place which the seller does not include secondly even with the adapter most say that the mic stops working after little while even with the adapter highly recommend avoiding this product 
0,very quiet also very easy to set up 
0,i really wanted to love this mouse but it is terrible the scroll hardly works and yes tried multiple mousepads add to that the inability to click core functionality of computer mouse and the whole thing is piece of crappy light up plastic 
1,i love it

0,the mouse works but after less than week of use by my son the roller ball no longer works you can scroll with it the rest of it works for now but will probably not make it through the school year

1,awesome for many reasons backlit for dark living room at night no batteries rechargable and comfortable keys stars 
0,i love this mouse ve ordered two the first one lasted me about year and the second ve received just died on me about eight months after purchase the clicker just stopped working on me 
1,i really like this mouse it works very well and do like the sleep mode for saving its charge it only less desirable aspect is its cord the connector at the mouse end does not slide smoothly into the connection 
1,i love the different colors easy to find at night holds charge for few days 
1,sounds great
1,this mouse does not work with my new mac air switched to my hp computer and it started to work periodically with it but now has stopped strongly recommend not purchasing this mouse to say the least it is unreliable 
1,love the pretty lights just wish that the charge would last longer still even with pretty long hours of gaming and accidentally leaving it on the battery lasts solid hours would recommend good for the price that for sure
1,an awesome speaker 
1,i was initially in love with this mouse however soon after while scrolling the mouse stopped scrolling you don realize how something so small you really see crucial everything works for the scroll to just stop literally want to throw the whole mouse out and probably will decided to hold on to it cause it just so cute and matches my laptop however soon after the sensor and clicker stopped working as well now forced to get new mouse 
1,adorable mouse it works very well and love that you are able to recharge it the mouse speed is very good and overall very enjoyable to use while working from home 
0,would prefer to buy bcz its cheap and nice
1,i bought this mouse specifically for its price and slim profile wanted something small and compact that is easy to pack in my laptop bag this fits the bill this mouse is perfect for everyday use such as going to websites using office applications like word excel and powerpoint etci would not recommend the mouse for gaming purposes and that is not what it is meant for anyway if you want mouse that works for web browsing office work on the go looks nice and is slim and compact get this device 
1,my granddaughter loves this for her gaming system
0,returned it
0,literally had this for less than months and suddenly can hear anything 
1,great product shipped fast and was ready right out the box also comes with the adapter which is nice since didn have to buy it 
1,this mouse is great it feels good in your handle glides well easy to use and looks amazing while doing it it makes work little less boring and looks so sleek on my desk 
1,perfectly acceptable for both business meetings and discord chats but the sound quality isn too good you sound like you re coming from far away other than that it worked for years no other complaints 
1,this looks incredibly cheaply made and if it drops off my desk positive it will break immediately 
1,it does not work at all cvharges itight goes on then all of sudden turns off and its like touching toy plastic like mouse its not worth the money
1,awesome keyboard the lights are amazing and the keys feel great when typing 
1,great headphones for gaming with friends and family at great price
0,it easy to use
0,definitely holds charge the day it arrived put it in charge and it still going weeks later on single charge 
1,if you have normal size ears they won fit to small if you have normal size head they won fit to big and hang down past ears 
0,the usb break apart and could no longer use the cordless mouse ugh
1, although it pretty it works great and love the colors got it for asthetics but it very functional work at home hours day and the charge is lasting quite long 
1,boys use these for fort nite and they work great they are not to heavy what so ever and that has been my challenge recommend these if have kids and under
0,this does not work for an xbox one false advertising 
1,i was used to buying name brand mouses and was worried about the size of this device but actually its good size just with lower profile works very well and sleeps and wakes up when you push the button on top the lighting is nice not real bright but just strip around the outside and the button lights up changes color which is nice touch so actually like it better than the other larger mouses have 
1,this is such great mouse it works so well and love the pretty colors it also doesn make any noise while clicking which was my priority would definitely recommend this 
1,for the price it not bad headset sound quality is good could use sound booster like button to increase the bass or treble that just my opinion after using multiple headsets that comes with those features overall they are right in the middle as far as sound and price is concerned also the cord is alil long like foot long wish it was shorter there is also two connects at the end it split with the headphone jack and usb at the end of the cord not really big thing but it does get in the way sometimes 
1,the keys are very quiet and the led add nice touch to the office however for typing occasionally do look at the keyboard to ensure of my hand placement is correct or to look at the key pad to punch numbers the downside is that the keys are pretty dark themselves so tough to see at glance overall happy with my purchase 
1,i love this mouse needed something to help me enjoy working back in the office and this really helps my mood 
0,i got this less and two months ago and loved it until today when it broke when touched the wheel 
0,bought these because it is rechargeable however the power ran out so quick need to charge it at least once week my previous mouse use batteries and didn need to change it for at least half of year 
1,this is very nice mouse for the price the charge in the battery lasts long time and the mouse buttons make almost no noise whatsoever perfect for use during lecture at school when you don want to disturb the speaker with incessant clicking noises not sure how this would be for gamers but the switchable dpi is very nice feature as well also do feel that should point out that the rgb lights are switchable on and off which is nice feature if you are like me and are in class where the room goes dark for presentations and video clips 
1, great price good quality wireless would be nice with better performance microphone 
1,amazing headset for the money great quality 
1,not for tablets and won accept return 
1,the mouse was shipped fast and the packaging was in good condition the pairing was fast and easy spent on razer mouse with the same functions and lighting it broke in six months very happy with my purchase 
0,battery died after mins with or without the color changing lights on this thing is useless
1, bought this as replacement headset for my work at home job and the sound quality coming in is nice but the sound quality going out is super muffled the ear muffs are also on the smaller side but that just means have larger than average ears lol
1,my son uses these for gaming on his switch and listening to music on his tablet his friends can hear him and he can hear them clearly 
1,small good shape easy to install 
0,the speaker skips so much that you can listen to the music extremely frustrating am major jbl fan so this is heartbreaking 
1,great noise canceling headphones 
0,it good mouse 
1,this headset is really nice only big thing is that you can use the mic and lights at the same time it one or the other the mic makes me sound really clear and love how you can hear bass clearly 
1,a great value 
1,daughter my love them she doesn have to hear my while doing either thing lol
0,it literally barely works no one on discord can hear anything say just the faintest whispering had to go back to my old mic
1,i bought this for my work laptop and just love it easy to use and love that it is rechargeable fantastic design so it not hard on your hands and connects easily with no issues 
1,so bought this few days ago and the first day of using it which was yesterday the color changing lights worked and now only the red light works this is bs turned it off for mins to give it rest but nope the lights still don work don recommend
1,sounds amazing just not the color ordered only gave stars because didn get the color ordered really wanted the blue one 
1,great product delivered with exceptional expectations thank you my kid love this keyboard
1,works as advertised great price 
0,easy to use
0,as expected
1,awesome speaker
1,great quality headphones love the audio output easy to setup highly recommend them 
0,i like everything so far the really long cable can be plus when needed 
0,i was searching for bluetooth mouse found one but didn like the color when changed to the silver one some how it switched off of bluetooth it is wireless and did work with the usb dongle the buttons are quiet and the movement was smooth unfortunately have mac and the usb ports are only usb the mouse does come with an adapter but this makes it stick out far and will get damaged had to return it 
1,it was exactly what was looking for and has great sound quality it connected easy with my flip and has created an amazing surround sound for my room 
1,the mouse is big enough to use and very smooth with my computer always look for wireless mouse so this one is the best on amazon that could find highly recommended 
0,this mouse worked just long enough for me not to be able to return it not sure what went wrong but it just gave out and that was it 
1,i like them they work like there name brand just do yourself favor and buy and audio mic adator for pc gaming and etc
0,good for the price not the most comfortable and not heavy enough its very light
0,the ergonomics are good but it has fatal flaw that makes it unusable when you first turn it on it works fine but after minutes or so it becomes very twitchy or jerky and completely unusable tried it on both macs and pcs same problem with both systems it too cheap to bother sending back but want to warn others not to make the same mistake 
1,i absolutely love it because it so beautiful thank you for the fast shipping 
0,got them for my nephew he said he likes them just have to see how long they lay because he rough on them 
1,great
1,i was happy with this purchase until the mouse wheel quit working purchased this device on july and week ago september it quit working after looking through the questions see others have experienced this too wouldn purchase this item it known issue 
0,works about of the time making it more frustrating than if it was literally useless paperweight doesn work as mouse though 
1,it worked great while it worked but after less then three months my mouse has stopped working it turns on and lights up but will no connect to the usb wirelessly any more won buy again and wouldn recommend if you re looking for something to last 
1,well just saying not sure why the price is expensive besides the lights on background of keys it is the same basic keyboard you will find in the wireless section bought cause of how cool it looks also you have to keep charging the keyboard to ensure it is fully juiced up so make sure you turn it off on the bottom so it wont die have not had to many times it died on me but how often do you remember to cut your keyboard off or plug it up other than that item is perfect 
1,this product is the best ve seen
0,it was perfect until the wheel stopped working before months of use
1,so really like it like you can shut of the lights if you want it is sensitive so your mouse moves very easily and it very easy for person who has laptop 
0,i bought this for my yo son he uses for gaming on the ps or ipad and for watching videos durable and high quality product 
1,highly recommend silent click is great you have the option to turn off the color changing mode 
1,my year old loves the blue light of the headset it looks cool and the sound quality is good only downside is it bit heavy my opinion my son doesn care he loves it 
0,it works just fine just not practical always have to recharge the battery it is bit of an annoyance 
0,the mouse got would make the pointer on the computer move without me moving the mouse and it constantly tried red even when it was on the rainbow setting and fully charged
1,works good and plug and play 
1,i had bought my husband smaller version of this speaker for my husband and we both loved it decided wanted one of my own and ordered this version oh my goodness the sound is amazing the charge on the battery lasts good long time use it almost every day you won be sorry with this product 
1,i use this mouse for casual surfing and scrolling no gaming but it smooth and responsive and looks awesome 
0,stopped working cant return either 
0,i bought this for my son to use on his xbox and he also uses it on his school laptop he says that he doesn have any issues with it and likes how quiet the keys are 
0,this is terrible product and we have been through of these and they do not hold up to my year old 
0,compact size big sound 
1,the best stuff ever the sound is lush and clear 
0,works just like figured plenty loud
1,the mouse is slim which is nice it seems to be made of thinner plastic which feels flimsy but over all it pretty good for the price
0,the headphones were not clear enough for me to hear words 
0,i purchased this for my mom and once the battery went dead it would not recharge 
0,i can hear everything in my games now and also can hear my gf yelling at me to get off the game while have them on
1,great
1,i like how light and easy to handle is 
1,great mouse got this because my laptop had to many wires sticking out everywhere this has been great to free up the mess of wires and make my work day easier 
0,i use for work it is needing to be charged almost every days 
1,it was very jittery on occasion went to replace it because it was quick buy to get me by until could afford better solution solution it served purpose but wouldn recommend the purchase if you could avoid it 
1,i was skeptical at first that such small ergonomic mouse would work pleasantly surprised and have really enjoyed using it forgot to recharge it but it lets you know before it goes out by slowing down or moving from one screen to my other got it plugged in immediately and it kept right on working while it charged highly recommend this mouse and plan on buying another to have as backup for when forget to charge really love the color changing sequence the colors are bright but not overly so just enough to make it fun 
1,good headset for ps recently got mine and they are overall good for everything 
1,great little mouse fits nicely in my hand you can turn the led on or off click to wake from sleep quiet clicking like it 
0,battery life seems to be decent have two of these and both have issues with the dpi randomly changing itself so have to click the button to change it numerous times day every now and then the one use at home doesn connect when turning on the computer have to unplug re plug the dongle do have it plugged into usb switch but seeing as it the only device that encounters this issue don believe the problem is the switch not likely to buy this again it been too frustrating 
1, love this mouse it super cute and lightweight love the led lights option paired perfectly with my macbook
0,for my laptop ii got it on may th it did work for two months and now it will not been chargei can use it anymore need to get new one
1,i ve used this keyboard for couple months and am completely happy the keys are satisfying to press the battery life is long and the aesthetic is great 
0,sleek look and battery lasts extremely long ve only had to charge it once since getting it highly recommend 
1,best mouse have ever used very smooth and really sharp looking 
1,easy to navigate lights add touch of fun use this as my traveling mouse with my lightweight laptop no complaints and no problems
0,i received this and tried to use it and it lags all over the computer screen it is horrible it very pretty but does not work even tried to charge it for two entire days and still lags 
1,nice low silhouette and quiet action does what is expected of mouse and is good looking to boot obviously cannot judge it ergonomic qualities from such short term of usage but it appears to be no strain at all on my wrist and fingers holds charge well the only caveat might mention is that the dongle is bit too short for if you re using while charging but that is minor issue well pleased with this mouse 
0,when got this mouse noticed rattling sound when it was plugged up saw that there was piece broken and rattling around on the inside the lights don look good at all returned it 
0,we have had stereo technology since at least the early sixties this unit by itself mono should have combed through the reviews and searched online hint should not have to would have given it one star for not being stereo capable but assumed some of the responsibility 
0,mic neverworked tried trouble shooting
1,great buy
0,this product stopped working for me after two days it was fine but now it no longer charges and doesn even work while it plugged in 
1,ergonomic and no need for mouse pad smooth scrolling as well this mouse is compact and has usb adapter the rgb lights are nice touch too this is perfect for small laptop or tablet best of all is the price and quality 
0,pretty much right after the return deadline the thing just stopped working broke not worth the money should ve sent it back to get my money back anyway 
1,portable and long battery life we ve used on float trips parties in garage fir the size it sounds good and base is good too sold my big speaker and stereo system in garage it plenty loud will be buying another one soon when they go back on sale bought mine in dec for 
0,the item would charge but then would not turn on or work at all in the computer
0,while working on my desk close by book fell on top of the mouse and now it doesn take charge by the way it was the first day zi was using it 
1,great sounds long battery life 
0,its just not good at all the colors don show as good as shown it does not connect to macbook and the mouse tracking his slow and horrible
0,mouse was working fine for about week now the middle button to scroll stop working
0,the plug to use in macbook does not work really needed this mouse so had to go out and buy plug myself spending more money for what this should have come with it working now but only because spent more money 
1,very nice colors beautiful and quality
1,this mouse captures the eye because of the constant changing colors also like the feel of it it not bulky and big think its great investment good for kids and gaming 
1, received this item as gift off my wedding registry check out my video for more detail but love this speaker the charge lasted me full week when was at the beach it super durable and wasn scared to get sand in it it goes super loud and super clear noise such great speaker 
1,pros the price sleek design wireless easy plug and play cons space bar is extremely wobbly for claiming this to be silent the other keys are satisfactory to say the most in relevance to silent keys additionally the lights come on only if it being used which isn much of con 
0,this mouse was an absolute waste of money spent dollars for the sensor to stop working in less than week
0,the head phones are good but they stopped working after months
1,great
0,it was sleek and nice looking mouse but the usb got annoying and broke easily
0,spend little more get real pair
0,i got this mouse aprilth and it just stopped working may th so cannot return it loved this mouse but sad it stopped working
0,i will quickly touch on the star ranking then get into it ergonomics feels good in my hand at first but after few minutes you start to realize something is off it little too small for extended use but hey that personal preference for the couple hours did use this thing the sleep mode worked did zero gaming with it because the basic task of trying to pull up netflix and hulu was nightmare the quiet click is top notch give that outta so ve had glitchy mice before and it was annoying but could deal with it for little bit they might twitch little or maybe vibrate some when the mouse wasn being used but this thing full jumps across the screen and not even in the right direction always use split screen and open netflix on the left screen and it pops up open on the right when move the mouse to the right it starts to move then jumps and ends up all the way back to the left it also lags every once in while and sometimes you put the mouse over something leave it there for second to make sure you are on what you want to click on and when you click it actually clicks on rows above where was this was on netflix this is nightmare of mouse do not buy its cheap mouse but not even the cheapest option you can buy cheaper mouse that functions properly the led lights did work just fine for me the next morning went back to using my mouse that is duct taped together until can get another one 
1,the sound of this small unit fills my living room for the money would recommend this like that it can connect to other devices and give full surround experience 
1,this klim would likely be an incredible gamer keyboard which is what it made for it sturdy has cool multi colored backlight so as long as you re young and or can type without looking at the keys you ll probably love it wanted backlit bluetooth keyboard for my laptop but the klim multicolor backlighting made the keys appear inconsistent and so were difficult to read the top characters of some keys didn light up as well as the bottom ones on the same key and found the different colors simultaneously left to right across the board added variability to the characters that impacted their legibility for me ended up keeping seenda much thinner and flatter adjustable backlighting in choice of several colors but only one at time so the keys were consistently bright sharp and clear 
0,good product
0,it is quite nice it has an interesting style and the colored lights give it special touch unfortunately in terms of performance is lousy the sleep mode seems to fail constantly sometimes it turns off for no reason and stops working for while being fully charged so it must be damaged internally very disappointed with this product no matter how nice it is it is not worth buying if it does not fulfill its main function 
0,stopped working after week 
0,i wasted my money on buying two of these wireless led mouse they literally only lasted one week charged them the only activity is prompt red flashing light purchased high end well name brand wireless mouse 
0,good thing it rechargeable because otherwise your changing batteries everyday instead of just plugging it in 
0,arrived in broken package that was ripped wet etc the amount of money spent on it should warrant decent product not thrilled that waited week to receive garbage product very irritating and very disappointed overall 
0,this keyboard goes in and out will work then stops now its has stop working don buy call warranty co and was told to make claim they provide the wrong site so the claim that was submitted was for their clothing rep didn refer me to another site amazon wasn useful either 
1,won play charging when battery life gets low another lemon from amazon 
0,i bought this mouse on the th of august and it broke on the st of the same month basically it lasted me for less than month the lights stopped working properly and then the middle part to scroll stopped working it broke do not recommend at all
0,i read the reviews and ordered two one for home one for office they both worked great for about weeks started having trouble with the charge not lasting and then by the time my return window expired they were both worthless can still plug in and the lights are pretty perhaps very weak night light that is what the star is for the pretty lights 
1,love it for my work from home job very ergonomic and smooth 
0,good for gaming
1,i like like like it lot 
1,seems like this is solid keyboard so far the build quality is lighter than would like it to be but solid enough 
1,this is an awesome mouse it is slender build so it fits small hand the lights are totally fun when you click the buttons it is strong click so that you know you have clicked on something it also has quick response on the computer it has an off on switch plus an automatic shut off so you won use up the batteries will be buying one for my daughter it is awesome 
1,best speaker out
1,works great 
0,then were kidding when they said this was quiet keyboard after using it for less than days the keyboard squeezes on several keys when push it including the space bar it is very annoying so plan on trashing it since it is past the return date purchased this keyboard because wanted light up keyboard use it for work too much noise 
1,mouse arrived the next day easy to set up and use have had no problems at all it works as it should 
0,it good size shape mouse let see how long it last in my son gand if it not brand name don last more then to week 
1,great
0,very heavy static mic lags terribly unable to use in this case you get what you pay for definitely didn work 
1,it super quiet have it plugged in through hub adapter to google slate tablet and it worked immediately no issues at all lights up and color changes which is just cool add on feature no complaints here very portable 
0,decent mouse looks and feels cheap and the light show kinda adds to the cheapness of the mouse cursor tracking is the biggest issue the cursor doesnt track consistently smooth when moving it around on the screen and the dts button doesn seem to do anything for controlling this 
0,worked for less than month it won charge real piece of junk not great product 
0,they are designed with mm jack and usb cable my gaming laptop has an output mm port and an input port for the mic normally use only usb headphones which is what thought this headset was apparently the usb only powers the lights useless will never buy from this company again they got my money which is all they were after 
0,bought it after going through many water proof keyboards am clumsy so this got wet but after letting it dry completely it works again with no issues had some issues with the st one bought cause it would no longer sync with pc but talked with tech support they sent another and it has not had any issues 
1,l ds are sick am having trouble figuring out the hearing but figure it out easily enoughsuper easy to figure out though
1, pleasantly surprised had to hook them straight to the tv with the adapter they sent because have an xbox but my kid is loving it and didn have to pay fortune pretty decent for the price very loud the squeaking noises were the buttons on my xbox controller 
0,they look cool but the volume doesn go high enough
1,they work great for schoolwork and gaming 
1,okay here we go was really excited to get this and try it out want to note that wasn expecting much since it is pretty inexpensive however my excitement didn last long the dpi will not change on the one got so changed my mouse settings on my pc this very very minimally helped couldn help but laugh while doing this because that curser is sliiiiiiiic ccccck for some this may fit comfortably in their hand but not mine also it goes to sleep quickly as in seconds quick yes timed it unfortunately ll have to try to return this since won use it ever by try to return it mean try to actually remember to take it to the post office or wherever need to take it because that never actually happens in closing if you have small hands you re looking for super slick meaning super fast mouse that you may or may not be able to change the dpi you ll only use it once maybe twice year and you re good at taking your returns where they need to go to get returned then go for it otherwise maybe look into different one also gave stars since is was inexpensive 
0,i would not recommend this mouse to anyone no right click available on the mouse does not work fell apart already it is very difficult to click the only plus is that it pretty color does not work very poor quality 
1,this headset was purchased as christmas present for my son he really loves it his friends ask him what headset he has because they can hear him perfectly must have good sound quality because he can never hear me when try to talk to him great product for the price glad we went with this one 
1,great little mouse fits nicely in my hand you can turn the led on or off click to wake from sleep quiet clicking like it 
1,i bought this mouse because saw it was wireless silent click which was perfect for me working in class room and not loving to hear the click of mouse all day have dropped it times and each time have been able to just move the plastic back into place and repair so the duriablily from drops is awesome for when move between classes to see my different classes

0,portabe durable in all types of weather conditions nice balance of high mid and low end frequency
1,as with several other reviews here the one purchased lasted several months until it just stopped tracking mid swipe thought maybe it just needed recharge as that what it has done in the past when forgot to charge it overnight but no it more like it just shorted out works for swipe and click and then stops again kinda sucks because it really cool and fun mouse with the led lights and the charging vs batteries guess ll look now to see if the warranty will help girl out 
0,so bought it because it was on sale for dollars that should have been my first hint the sound quality was terrible ve had better call quality on ham radio from the freinds said it echoed and had static sound and there is about football feild length of wire hanging on it that just irritating 
0,i ve had this mouse for about two months or less it does not work will charge but only hold bit of power for about minutes and die

1,good fit sounds is good and great for gaming
1,purchased as gift for my nephew he really likes it 
0,the sleep mode is ridiculous they stated the lights keep on seconds and nit true they stay few seconds worst keyboard ever
1,my other wireless mouse stopped working for some reason and required batteries so had to get another one love that it is rechargable and has the lights the lights change each time you touch the mouse on its side thats cool also love how the top of the mouse is so smooth and the gold color is actually shiny didnt know before buying but it has sleep mode so thats great for if forget to turn it off have to double check the manual but there are switches and dont know what the middle switch is for since the mouse hasnt worked in that function think its cool too that they include the adapter if you need to plug it into usb port to connect to your device honestly like it only other thing is im not sure how know when its dying again may be in the manual 
1,we love this speaker awesome sound with deep bass 
1,i bought this mouse in april liked it lot for months for the last few weeks it has stopped tracking reliably and the battery dies within about half hour even if try to use it plugged into the computer it stops tracking and the lights dim can find any warranty information on it feel like it should have lasted more than months think ll buy wireless mouse with known brand name and hope for better luck 
0,this is the cheapest flimsy made in china item ve seen do not buy it never worked out of the box 
0,it looks nice lights up difficult to use since it freezes up the computer for some odd reason will even knock off my bluetooth headphones do not waste your 
1,love it
0,great product but little too flat for me 
1,came in new condition and everything works perfectly awesome 
1,i liked the feel and positive sensitivity of the keys unfortunately it just wasn bright enough for me to see the lettering 
1,i was bit skeptical about it being quiet clicker but was pleased to learn it really is quiet the clicks are greatly muffled and are soft to the click my only complaint is that the scrolling wheel does not click quietly the lights are enjoyable but don display constant stream of colors as they forcibly manually change when moved or clicked they otherwise will rotate when the mouse is left idle overall it really nice mouse to buy and use comfortable and light kind of reminds me of the apple mouse 
1,just received it yesterday but have already been using it to listen to music out in the patio the music is so crisp still need to adjust the settings on my phone to make sure get my moneys worth with quality have yet to test the range but was about away with wall in between and music was still going 
0,the kids like them for minecraft 
0,the type converter from this item wasn working so had to use the one had everything else was working good other than that 
0,i love this mouse but am so bummed it broke after months the roller ball completely stopped working but at least could still use the mouse to navigate the screen 
1, this mouse is lightweight it charges fast by small cable which is included it does not take batteries it puts on light show of colors fun for adults or children this can easily be turned off by switch on the bottom of the mouse the mouse itself is easy to assemble there is small usb plug that clips to the bottom of the mouse for storage when you are not using it this plugs into your computers usb port when you do use it this is great mouse to use as backup the color is great also review title great spare mouse
0,i removed the mouse from it box threw the box away and charged the mouse started using it and on the second day it just stopped working because couldn return it in it original box just threw it away 
0,they are decent but very uncomfortable 
0,if you only need to use mouse for no more than an hour this might be okay bought for my office for my laptop bag and for home they do not hold charge 
0,it felt like it would break easily and the texture of the mouse would get dirty quickly 
0,it very light very quiet installed right away works perfect on win lights are bright enough but not too bright looks and works exactly as described 
1,excellent sound and battery life
1,i bought this mouse to throw in my laptop bag for those times when the trackpad was too much of pain to use the mouse is slightly small in my hand but is still comfortable and tracks well really appreciate that it charges from micro usb cable great value for the price 
0,it was working fine at first always kept it charged but after few months it just completely stopped working when try to turn it on it just flashes red and turns itself off tried charging changing the usb ports and still nothing waste of money 
1,i have small bluetooth speaker and was looking for one bit bigger for an upcoming trip wanted something that could fill living room and kitchen with some decent sound first bought the soundcore flare and while liked the sound and eq settings on the app it just didn fill the room with full sound the jbl might be bit narrower on the soundstage the overall quality and low end were enough to seal the deal also like you can connect two devices at once the charge has nice heft to it and the construction is solid definitely feel like got my money worth pros solid bass even sound quality construction connect two devices at once battery life seems good usb port for charging the speakercons soundstage bit narrow app has no eq settings
1,a friend of mine had one of these had to get one for myself puts out good sound and isn ridiculously expensive 
0,i bought this for my son for microphone to talk to his friends on ps the microphone does not work at all 
1,pretty good sound and audio quality for the price fits well and can wear for long periods of time 
1,this speaker actually lives up to its advertisements the sound is clear and loud the battery life has lasted hours on multiple occasions all for decent price ve recommended it to all my friends specifically the ones that went the ultra cheap route 
1,i enjoy how it connects very well to my pc and like the sound very good
0,mic has some echo jack seems loose in controller my experience they sounds ok if you don need microphone
1,i used them for gaming and absolutely love them the sound quality is great for the price if your wanting to something cheap that had good sound quality these are it the noise cancellation could be little better but these are great for the price
1,headset works great ear muffs are deep and large enough that they cover my ears fully with no pressure points normally when wear headset my ears start to hurt after min or so not the case with this headset very comfortable to wear for long periods of time at the office or gaming sessions 
1,great product for price
0, beware stay away bought this keyboard in sept did not even last year fully charged checked connections nothing do not buy this junk you are throwing away bucks

1,excellent mouse for the price
1,haven had much time to use it yet but like it so far 
0,performs as expected
1,great sound quality
1,i love the headset it perfect for gamin
1,headphones are comfortable
0,this product already fell apart it very lightly used and the mouse is broken already 
1, light weight but feels solid you feel the keys but no loud clicks easy to adjust the brightness and lighting modes wish there was way to adjust the sleep timer but other than that love it haven had it long enough to comment on the battery live but their usb is little short not major issue for me have spares up to feet long update on the battery life it great obviously it depends on use but it lasts as long if not longer than other rechargeable keyboards have used the usb recharges it fast when you need it to also have klim blaze wireless mouse and fusion earbuds love can use the same cable to charge the mouse and keyboard the earbuds have much longer cable than most ideal for moving around while you are plugged in to the computer 
0,very smooth and quiet 
0,i have two problems no matter how long you charge it for it dead in an hour that if it been works the usb plug in takes two people to get out and afraid it will get stuck and ruin my computer the appearance is great but it doesn work and could break the usb port because of this do not recommend since this posted the company offered to change review instead of just sending another mouse clearly they know there product does not work 
0,right out of the box he didn like them he didn try them 
1,great mouse for the price nice and soft matte feel very quite clicks perfect for working in coffee shop works well on mouse pads and flat surfaces and connected to my computer instantly without needing to instal any type of software note rgb lights are not customizable but still cute as heck and works great 
0,excelente
0,constantly lags or just stops working while trying to type even when the battery is full 
0,it got wet and had no issues battery life is great lasted all day 
1,love it very ergonomic
1,this thing is terrific it has shocking amount of bass for small speaker jbl pretty much nailed the design if were to complain it would be that the base is little narrow use the speaker by my pool and dont want to bump the speaker and it roll into the pool again for you people that are complaining about it being mono its an engineering choice to deliver performance in other areas do you have to have stereo drivers that will be inches apart is that really needed of course not if that bothers you there are ton of other devices that might be better fit but doubt it will deliver as well in the other areas have an old bt stereo speaker and it does not come close to delivering sound on par with the charge going mono delivers more volume longer battery lower heat and simplified controls bass sucks power this thing gets pretty damn loud and really delivers ton of bass stream to it in the backyard when swimming in the pool it has really been great it has been accidentally kicked into the pool few times but no damage and it has proven to be water resistant as advertised 
1,clarity all the way great product
1,excellent product compared to bose this has excellent sound and is waterproof 
0,stopped working cant return either 
0,the sound is awesome very lightweight however the microphone is very poor quality and no one can hear me so waste of money for my purposes bummer it cool unit just wished it worked 
1,bought this for my husband he was very pleased with it works just fine and comes as described 
1,i didn need the lights and everything it pretty annoying as the mouse wanders quite bit and won always listen to where you re trying to go 
0,it ok wished the lighting stayed on going into sleep mode 
1,excellent
1,i really like this mouse it is light and re action is immediate also like its usb input great product 
1,very good quality and comfortable
1,this thing works well most of the time if you don turn it off and just let it go to sleep mode it dies fairly quickly but you still get couple of days of use out of it if you re not using it hours day at least if you turn it off every time you re done though you can get probably month but at least weeks out of it with moderate use originally bought it to use with my ipad however the case on my ipad wouldn really allow the usb to plug into the charger port wish they made an option to get either usb or usb plug as you get both with this mouse but you have to plug the usb into the usb adapter which makes the usb plug significantly thicker than necessary now use it for my macbook just warning if you want it to scroll like regular mouse you have to change it in the setting of the computer but that macbook problem not problem with this mouse not all of apple setting decisions make sense but that nothing new do really like that can chose to just turn on the mouse with solid red color which preserves battery or turn it on to change colors reduces how much time you get out of the mouse but is cool feature my only complaint is that sometimes the mouse isn tracking perfectly and the cursor is in completely different place than would expect it to be further behind where was moving it to rather than the cursor doing its own thing but that may also be thing have to change on the laptop 
1,you will be needing to charge this keyboard every day ve had keyboards that lasted for months on single charge this is definately not one of them other than that it great keyboard 
0,love for the most part charges fast but runs out fast hard to see the pointer arrow have closed lots of things by accidentrn
1,noise cancellation and output sound was fine however the microphone leaves lot to be desired people on the other end could barely hear me and said sounded like was super far away there is also no way to adjust the microphone so that it sits closer to your face it in fixed position 
1,i ve been using this mouse for work since received this last month it worked great the whole time and charged it once week now it won turn in thought it needed to be charged so plugged it in for few hours turned it back on and it won work at all normally the lights are all on when the switch is on it won even pick up my cursor and have to use different mouse to work very disappointed that it didn even last me more than month don waste your money edit the seller emailed me offering me money to delete my review sounds like they do that to everyone seems like there would be way more negative reviews for this trash product if they weren paid to delete them 
0,the microphone on these headphones didn seem to work at first but then found it had to be in just the right spot which is not normal they also do not light up like the picture shows them doing this doesn affect how they are used but they shouldn advertise them lighting up 
1,just wish it came with all the fixing but still works well 
1,love the keyboard in every way except when am using it and suddenly even in the middle of game it stops working completely and needs to be charged it won work while charging either you have to wait for it to be done if you can get on schedule you re good 
0,very good for gaming on my pc 
1,works great on my desktop good battery life and sleep mode works seemlessly good value recommend

0,mouse will not work have only had it for about days and the mouse just stopped working will not charge either 
1,i bought one to try for myself at home and loved it so much ordered two more to use at work this is the best wireless mouse ve ever had great value too 
0,it was initially pretty decent keyboard but after few months things started going wrongthe spacebar started sticking in the pressed state and after about year it stopped recharging and it keeps turning off and on with every key pressprice is in par with quality guess disappointment nonetheless

0,it came quick
1,fits my hand perfectly 
1,this is great mouse easy to use runs very smoothly and the color matched my keyboard perfectly would recommend this product to anybody

0,just spend the extra money on mouse that will actually last you more than two uses highly annoyed
0,mouse was very light and would keep charge adapter broke week after got it 
1,i glad got this for my dad he loves it 
0,i really liked the mouse but it broke after few months it does not follow my commands eg copy and paste 
0,everything is perfect but the whole point while got this was because its wireless but wireless is useless if theres no reception after feets after year or so can remember it stopped working all it does now is just flashing light back and forth when try to type something in 
1,this is such an excellent product it quiet it in no way ever bothers my carpal tunnel and the colors are rich and vibrant the battery charge lasts for quite some time too additionally the customer service is second to none my usb dongle sadly disappeared in move and they replaced it free of charge no less within days of my email to tech support they provided ample instructions on how to sync the new receiver and even included candy in the package as friendly touch cannot brag enough about how great klim is 
0,it is exactly as pictured works well 
1,it was great until it stopped working won even turn on charged it of course and still doesn work at all time window to return passed really not what you expect from amazon ll be taking steps to get my money back you can bet on that don care how cheap it was

0,new update of all the damn products have bought did not buy an extended warranty for this product so guess am screwed update update not only is this keyboard is loud ad it finally stopped working thank god for year warranties update change the rating to star the keys have become louder over time please don buy this keyboard my friends on the phone say how loud the keys are all the time now want my money back granted they are not the clacky mechanic keys but close guess need membrane keys will try to take handed video later but every time hit the spacebar holy crap the damn noise it my fault was getting away from paying for another logitech keyboard that only glows dim white like the pretty colors this one has but when you put silent in the description it better be silent 
1,the mouse arrived today easy to set up so far it is working properly like the fact that it rechargeable no more aa battery to replace ll have to get use to its size lot shorter than my old morosoft mouse hope it lasts as long as the old mouse time will tell 
1,this mouse is perfect addition to your laptop it is easy to set up very affordable and the ergonomic design reduces hand fatigue 
0,quit working after months can get it to work anymore charging port is messed up have unplugged it once 
0,they re good pair but are very flimsy after few uses but don count on my review my sister think may have messed with it
0,i like this keyboard overall especially how low profile the buttons are which prefer but the keyboard lights go to sleep way too fast and then you have dark keyboard 
1,easy and fits my hand have some numbness in my right hand 
0,unfortunately bluetooth cuts out the audio high frequencies for portable bluetooth speaker this is great my daughter enjoys listening to her music while in the shower speaker outside the shower but isn harmed by the humidity 
0,it didn fit the controller
1,the sleek design is perfect easily slips into briefcase without being too bulky and the sleep mode is awesome
1,not great they don really fit snug on your ears no noise cancelation not very loud for gaming mic works good light is cool probably good for kids thought it was good deal on decent set but really they are just headset ill be returning them as they were not what was expecting or hoping for and don fit 
1,fits my son perfectly he loves the lights and loves this headset 
1,silent clicks works great takes getting used to lower profile not having to worry about battery is golden 
1,i purchased it was good all could think about was how good two must sound in stereo second one arrived today and the pair exceeded my high expectations they sound amazing get 
1,ordered this mouse in early september as of today it no longer holds charge bought this mouse to have something portable to go along with my laptop as generally dislike using the trackpad it size was ideal and it was overall comfortable and easy to use however this mouse does not hold charge at all had to charge it at least twice per week remember this is not mouse used on my primary computer either and yes do turn it off when it is stored in my bag not thrilled that now have to replace it after only year of use and will not be purchasing again 
1,excellent sound quality much louder than expected small enough to take just about anywhere ve gotten it pretty wet several times and still going strong great product 
0,i use it with my chromebook
1,it cute guess it is pretty cheaply made you can just tell by the feel of it got the matte black one it charges pretty fast and lasts for hours on one charge love the nano usb plug it came with cord but just use my phone charger it does change colors and also has the option of turning the colors off with the little button on the bottom the instructions are all in chinese but using it is pretty easy the nano fits in little spot under the mouse for storage and also comes with an adapter it is quite flat so not the best for long term use like with gaming ll keep it but wouldn purchase it again for the price update have used this cheap little mouse for hours every night since got it ve only had to charge it maybe once week the charge is phenomenal still works perfectly 
0,i an very unhappy with this products uses less than year the wire on usb adapter is broke and the mouse no longer work not happy at all can send back so you can look at it 
0,i needed new mouse for my laptop decided to wire less must and rechargeable this fits all my needs plus an automatic setup 
1,these things are awesome paid don use them for gaming so no rating but the sound quality is so good the only problem is they don adjust any smaller and rest bit heavy on my head they do have cushion though so that helps and my ears are completely covered 
1,i have been using this keyboard for about or days now and so far it works really well for it intended purpose love the way that the keys feel and that the lights look when am typing that being said there are few things that knocked this keyboard down to only stars the first is that while the keyboard is advertised as being silent this is not the case in fact have found that some of the keys that are more commonly used such as the enter key or the spacebar are actually louder than the rest of the keys for me this hasn been huge deal but can see how people would be upset if they bought it with the intention of having quiet keyboard the second thing is that the led lights are not as bright as would have wanted in the dark they stand out perfectly and look amazing however in daytime or brighter lighting the lights are hard to see and draw away from the overall aesthetic of the keyboard 
1,this is the best gaming headset we have purchased to date durable good noise cancellation great sound we ve had these for little over year and compared to others we ve gotten on amazon with great reviews these are the only ones that live up to their star ratings we now own the orange and the purple pairs and have recommended this particular set to friends who have purchased as well good buy can say enough good things 
1,very reactive but not quite membrane and not as quiet as they claim took minute to get used to how loud the space bar especially was but love the colors and how quick it wakes sleeps holds long charge and recharges quickly have carpal tunnels and this is easier on my hands than even my macbook air ergonomic and reactive granted its not wake the family loud or anything but far from silent my favorite keyboard ever nevertheless 
1,won work at all 
1,the headphones are used by my son mainly for his classes they are very comfortable to spend lot of time listening to them without being distracted by external noises he also uses it for games he does not need to be connected to his pc he can listen to his classes away from home or even camping connected to his smartphone he is very happy with these 
0,after one month the mouse would not stay turned on even though it appeared to be fully charged will not buy rechargable again

1,my son wanted this for his macbook so will tell you it needs an adapter the macbook doesn have usb port but after that he is pleased with the performance he uses it to play games too and says it is responsive 
1,update lost my favorite mouse today bought it on jun reviewed it aug and it died yesterday aug so the mouse lasted appx weeks two and half months is pretty disappointing lifespan the battery died so plugged it in as always yet it doesn connect anymore ve tried removing the usb transmitter rebooting the computer plunging it in and out and turning it off and on but nothing even tried re charging it but nope it lost cause bought this mouse to replace the wireless logitech was using for my laptop it died and decided to try this rechargeable mouse from okimo never heard of the brand but impressed this first charge lasted so long that almost forgot it was rechargeable bought it in mid june it aug today and just on my second charge the first charge lasted over month this mouse does shut off after it idle for while and sure that is the secret to the long battery life just quick left click and it back in business almost immediately love the slim feel of this mouse it works beautifully thought the changing light would bother me old but it doesn it more like pleasant subdued highlight effect ll probably buy another one for my desktop but in another color so don get them mixed up 
1,great quality came quick happy as can be
1,sounds great and is very sturdy for those little accidents of fall short distance definitely going to get few more to pair it with 
0,does not come off his head 
0,the product is cheap and worked well for the first months but after that it started becoming unresponsive would plug it in because thought it was low in power but that didn solve the issue either use lap top and have lap desk where it has built in mouse pad area ve had it for years so was thinking it was too old and worn down and the mouse wasn able to read it so bought new mouse pad but still nothing tried updating drivers with various programs tweaked bunch of settings and followed the advice from several websites nothing so disconnected it and brought out my wired mouse and it isn working either this product even disabled my track pad but luckily found way to get it working blame this crap product as it literally almost bricked my laptop

0,after two months of non regular use this mouse has already stopped working properly scroll wheel has completely stopped working on it own and now feels somewhat loose when touched was good while it worked and liked the color of it but only two months of use is unacceptable when there are other similar priced options from other companies

0,this is very good product
1,i love it

0,quality sound lighting and comfy to use
1,excellent for gaming use the to play warzone
1,this speaker sounds fantastic and has great look thought it didn come with charging cable but it is actually in the back of the box in thin cardboard sleeve 
1,i like the looks feel and sounds of these headphones the cable could be longer and longer cable separation of the input usb and the ear jack would be an improvement the volume control is mispositioned for tall user as it gets in the way and is heavy on the cord otherwise these things are great and do highly recommend them

1,i like the fact that it micro usb instead of swapping aaa battery and it very light weight and soft and easy to use

0,not bad pretty smooth operation no delays in movement connects quickly to any lap top 
0,lasted whole weeks before it quit working started acting up and finally just quit would not recommend
1,great mouse nothing super fancy comfortable to use the lights are pretty cool but there is an option to not have them on which is great to extend battery life holds charge really well and will still work with the usb charger plugged in if necessary plugged in to different computers and worked immediately on both seems quite reaponsive but only use it for general computer work so dont know how it would work for gaming all in all great mouse for decent price will update if anything changes

0,good if you want wireless mouse that works for months otherwise buy something else 
1,the noise quality is really good also the way can hear it is really good also my friends all ask me what mic have because it so good
1,i do wish that the sleep mode was bit longer as worry that drains the battery life bit the first one received needed to be replaced after month however love this keyboard contacted the seller via their official website not through amazon and they sent me replacement free of charge great customer service use this keyboard about hrs day during the work week and usually charge it every other day it is nice that you can still use it while it is charging did not realize how loud my original office keyboard was until the first one of these died even messaged my coworkers and apologized this keyboard is quieter than my original dell keyboard if had to choose would buy wired keyboard only so didn have to worry about charging but really love this keyboard it easy to adapt love the colors love the layout and lolita with customer service is the best

0,pretty but the quality is very poor it is rechargeable which was selling point but the quality isn there 
1,the mouse arrived with great packaging and easy to do follow instructions the feel is very smooth like the on off switch which is very sturdy and think will last for long time charging is simple able to store usb adapter on mouse best of all the lights are bright and as expected
0,great speaker we use it on the lanai for pool music bit much on the bass out of the box but adjustable via the app can be paired with additional speakers for large area 
1,i bought second speaker to have it in stereo but notice while having it that the other speaker cut off few seconds other then that it feels like brand new speaker if want true stereo need to by splitter and connect both as normal speakers for my laptop plus the syncing with youtube is pretty bad with videos it sounds clear and loud oh and one last thing about in stereo mode on and iphone it works with one app at time so use it on youtube for one day with the jbl connect and then use it with google music another day when you sync the stereo mode with the audio app you that you want to use it on windows its basically party mode and no real stereo mode did this with my laptop and one speaker sync in and the other sync in bit slower of seconds to sync in this is why give it stars but over rall can charge my phone or use each one as speaker louder then my phone cant use it as google or alexa voice activator or even siri but as two speakers in stereo is good on ios on my iphone but cant do it on windows 
1,i love my speaker this was actually my second purchase ve had my first one for almost years and use them everyday and in the shower and the quality is still the same as day one the battery lasts forever would highly recommend 
1,i ve had this speaker for well over year now use it full volume in the shower while its soaking wet and also outside on the patio ve had it connected to my smaller tv that move between porch and patio but my sony works better for that due to the sony app to control the volume via bluetooth being much better than the jbl app it still looks and works as good as when first got it battery lasts good amount of time and it has incredible bass for its size especially if its placed against wall or better yet in an inside corner have been very happy with its quality and performance now some negative aspects the battery level indicator lights are placed very low so they are not visible in most cases and then the unit just goes dead with no warning when the charge runs out the base is small compared to the speaker so it can easily roll over and off table if bumped speakers are on the ends so you can stand it up vertical it does make loud melodic sound when turned off it is pretty rugged and waterproof so the addition of case adds no value is just another useless item cluttering your life and is environmentally negative suggest getting one without the case the current price is much much more percent more than when purchased it maybe due to covid price gouging or just rampant inflation never buy used product that requires built in battery as someone is unloading it because its defective or reached its end of life even if it still looks like new 
0,i have mac book and have been charging the mouse for hours and it wouldn connect have tried everything and looked up how to set up the mouse but it didn work 
0,so bought jbl it came with case charging cable and socket adapter jbl cost more and only came with speaker nothing else sound quality was the same get jbl cost less and comes with more 
0,you can get sound only on mac microphone is not supported 
0,mine did not hold charge very long day at the most if don use it for work when used it for work needed to plug it in half through my workday so use it only on my private computer couple hours day 
0,i don know if mine have factory defect or something but is not loud at all nearly hear anything from the left side it waste of money to me 
1,it is sleek and like the fact that can charge it on my computer it does light up and it works great after sitting for while the mouse needs to wake up by pressing the right click 
1,love this speaker is the best thing that ever happened to me
1,this was an upgrade from my old jbl charge and what difference the charge is superior in every way the base is better the sound quality of the music is better the build is better 
1,i use it for gaming on my ps and love this headset for the price 
0,got this to try to alleviate hand pain from using traditional mouse helped enough shape wise but the battery is so short that it doesn last day was using for work so that is problem 
1,grandson loves it
1,its strong clear and great
1,i literally just received it it would be nice to have the opportunity to at least unbox it before you ask for rating sheesh
1,best portable bluetooth speaker we ve bought basically indestructible we ve taken on the lake with us riding side by sides pools etc you won regret it 
1,i really like this this is replacement for broken battery operated one used to have love that this can charge from usb port and not having to rely on batteries or worry that they might run out at an inconvenient time it got cool lights around the side and it works well on lot of surfaces use my laptop in recliner chair and this works running on the edge of the chair just fine ve also used it on wooden table top and vinyl countertop surfaces with good results it does take just second when the laptop boots up to locate but that minimal the usb wireless component is small and fits really inconspicuously into an unused port on my laptop without being in the way at all all in all ve been very happy with the quality and efficiency this was great purchase 
1,i am very happy with the sound quality out of the box it would be nice to be able to turn the bass dow bit but it isn overwhelming for the price this is winner 
0,worked ok for month now there is background noise and bad echo
1,great quality headset
0,it works okay but is hard to charge 
0,my friends say they hear little static when speak but not much more than another mic around the same price it what expected decent sound 
1,i purchased this mouse because it matched my laptop and seemed like it would look really attractive and cool when was using it it looked exactly like the mouse in the picture and was easy to charge and use it also held charge for long time which was really happy about the reason my review is so low is because my mouse only lasted for months and then it completely stopped working no matter what did certainly wasn expecting wireless mouse to last forever but it would have been nice to get at least months out of it before it died if you re looking for something cute and short term and don mind having to buy several mice every year this is the perfect purchase for you 
1,this is great speaker light and easy to work basic controls that get the job done with no confusion ordered carry strap for it from amazon as well must get the carry strap for hanging and protection gave it out of for sound quality it delivers more bass than treble great speaker for the money claims to have hr battery based on use and is waterproof can touch that plenty loud for the beach or backyard
0,i purchased this for my office work and it broke down after weeks the scroll wheel stopped functioning be aware of this and look for something else with better quality thanks
1,the mouse feels amd looks great that the only positive aspect there is this thing cannot even connect to its own hardware so half the time you re just clicking happening this piece of garbage connects 
0,half the time there is about delay after moving mouse and moving the curser 
0,it really nice headset was bit disappointed when found that the usb was only for the lights and that you needed the splitter for the pc sadly my laptop only has one jack so had to order another splitter just to use the new headset may have missed the description about all of that so it could be my fault it would have been nice though if the usb worked for both the lights and the headset 
0,it did not come with usb cable to charge the mouse wasted my money 
0,all hear is static and can barely be heard from others very unhappy
1,i love everything about these headphones they have great design and the noise cancellation is amazing the fun thing is they have cool led lights would buy again 
1,great product we use it mostly on our fire tablet and it works great only complaint is that there is not built in storage for the usb adapter 
0,this worked great at first but have to keep it on power or it will only last about hours after about months 
0,bought this in the beginning of august and it already doesn work don waste your money 
1,as previous jambox owner purchased this because was told there would be good bass sound clarity and volume love playing loud music when showering unfortunately this wasn it wish could return because it not given what was sold 
0,this is very nice product the mouse does not need pad can work on the bare desk on sheet of paper etc my device does not have multiple leds only red or the software use does not employ all its features but there is no need to complain will buy again without hesitation

0,first removed the charging cable from the box and found that the wire was broken and figured could find another cable but then pulled out the mouse and it was broken as well the top half of the mouse was broken off from the bottom half needless to say returned the product for refund 
1,convenient quite excellent connection with computer
0,i have held back writing review on this mouse based on some of the comments that it would die on them or it became unreliable after while it has not been the case for me have had it for several months now and it is very reliable and maintains all of its functions intact would recommend the mouse 
0,i bought these maybe couple months ago they were working great but all of sudden now nobody can hear me using them on xbox one ve tried changing settings but nothing has worked very disappointed 
0,scroll stopped working after weeks of use
1,head phones worked as promised they look great during zoom calls adds little flair to business meetings 
0,overall underwhelming headset given it cheap price sure it could meet your needs don like that the ear muffs don turn so its kind of uncomfortable to wear can imagine wearing these for long periods of time the chord connector is obnoxiously long unless this is something you re looking for mic settings mute is all basic controls which is expected with lower price point mic overall not practical for long term use in my opinion will be returning 
1,great product fast shipping aaaaa
1,works great on xbox for gaming highly recommending this product to all 
0,not loud enough strange soud quality makes music sound wierd 
0,long lasting battery 
0,highly recommend
1,this speaker is easy to use it also has excellent sound quality 
1,got the mouse hooked up and at first it didn work light up but rgb function and connection to pc didn work figured out it needed to sit and fully charge for everything to work mouse was doing great until found issue with its sleep mode when the mouse falls asleep to save battery it wakes up very quickly however from that point on its control over the cursor becomes delayed it ping is tripled and you can watch the cursor stick and then start to move again while moving the mouse turned the mouse off and back on again to resolve this problem so the sleep feature on this mouse is terrible have to turn it on and off as needed 
0,they look like the photo the set comes with appropriate cords they work so far noise cancellation got only stars because can still hear people talking at normal volume around me 
1,i had slight issue and was sent new keyboard with express shipping turned out the original keyboard worked after all great customer support 
0,this mouse feels very sleek to the hand however the battery only lasts about hours and takes about an hour to charge fully the led lights are not very bright even when turn the feature off the mouse still dies in about three hours 
1,excellent mouse for the price

0,the quality of the sound pleasantly surprised me we were going to use it just for camping but because of the option to recharge my phone take this everywhere 
1,perfect for gaming and talking to friends in games 
0,i liked the color
1,great product mouse is exactly as advertised on the site highly recommended 
1,i bought this mouse to match the keyboard bought for my daughter to use with her laptop she does online school and likes having mouse as well as keyboard she likes that they match and both light up didn know how it would be for gaming 
1,this is very nice keyboard and of good quality there was no issue getting my pc to recognize it once plugged in the usb adapter one annoying thing about the keyboard is that the background light turns off after about seconds get that this is probably to preserve battery life but in dark environment such at nighttime or for gaming it hard to find the characters on the keyboard when the background light is turned off it would have been nice if there was an option to leave the background lights on while the computer is on or have them turn off after seconds of inactivity would have given this keyboard much higher rating if it weren for this 
1,use it with my laptop works perfectly 
1,sleep mode and charge life is great
1,i love this wireless mouse it super cute modern and goes perfect with my macbook love the colored lights as well and it fast

1,i use this set for my work office work remotely and am in meetings all the time and this headset is very comfortable and works great my wife and dogs are in the house and the noise cancellation works great obviously not for the microphone when you aren on mute great buy recommended to co worker and you as well 
1,jbl charge waterproof portable bluetooth speaker gray best speaker ever 
0,battery life is no good followed manufacturer procedure for the initial charge frequent disconnect from usb adapter lighting is about the only good thing constantly missing keystrokes while typing as it is right now as write this claims to be quite typing nope don get that either hard of hearing and its annoying would look somewhere else should ve returned it
1,it fits my hand and the light show is cool 
1,i wrote negative review for this purchase company reached out to me and offered replacement free of charge while really appreciate the replacement found the new set of headphones had the same issue as the original choppy sound is not an ideal way to immerse yourself into game truly appreciate the company effort but can recommend this product 
0,the one ordered will only turn on if the switch is in strange position that is between the clicks had to move the switch carefully with two fingers until found the very small area where it turns on sending it back because its almost impossible to use if the switch gets moved it takes few minutes to turn it back on

0,good for the price
0,this product is absolute garbage can even sir away seem my console and so cheaply made its not even worth the cash spent on it
0,very quick delivery nice keyboard simple to setup
1,i got this wireless mouse for my daughter because she was getting tired of using the old wired mouse for playing games on the pc so far her experience with it has been great the size was perfect for her average teen hand and she lefty the main avantage was the mouse was rechargable so we don have to worry about replacing the battery every so offten plus for me 
0,disregard any negative comments this is great piece of gear 
1,i have been using this keyboard for almost and half months and at first issues with finding the on off switch for turning on wireless and had to have both plugged into my computer for wireless and charging after found the switch on the back it made everything easier and more convenient would recommend this to anyone looking for good wireless keyboard with long battery life 
1,this product is excellent love its lights it charges super easy it is soft to the touch and accurate on movement 
0,function well at work still 
0,not sure if the one got was just defective but the tracker did not seem to work very well as an analyst need something with smooth path and this mouse started stopped very abruptly had to return it 
1,it is an amazing headset
1,i picked this keyboard since it one of the few out there that still have the old school design with big tall enter button instead of the wide one was very pleasantly surprised with how nice typing feels and how quiet it is these were the main requirements had and happy to say it ticks all boxes only wished it operated with replaceable batteries as those tend to last longer in my experience instead it has you charging the built in battery with cable which lasts about weeks before needing to recharge it but that was my fault for not paying attention to the description other than that noticed the space key is slightly louder than the rest of the keys but really this is just nit picking and not noticeable when typing normally overall really very happy with my purchase 
1,it sounds pretty good and can take it anywhere love it
1,it super amazing it so nice to play your music wherever you go definitely recommend the buy 
1,very confortable headset with great sound quality 
1,it good for pinch it doesn have the best quality also it not for console gaming the led lights needs to be hooked up to usb in order to light up wouldn recommend if you want to play on console ended up going back to turtle beach 
0,nice and compact
0,not worth it had this for only months and it broke it just stopped working could not scroll at all no matter what did not worth the money then after contacting amazon was charged dollar restocking fee for them and had to send it back on my own 
1,this is not for an adult hand this is better suited for child hand it also does pretty quickly it very uncomfortable to use and totally not worth it even at the lightning price bought it at 
1,i super love this jbl speaker my uncle had bought speaker not this one and it cost him and it was bigger than this one supposedly it one of the best brands and honestly it as loud as my uncle and this was cheap use the speakers almost every day and it lasts almost like days and half sometimes three and it charges pretty fast don regret buying this speaker super love it 
0,like it
0, doesn light up since got it and only one headphone work
1,i ve had three other jbl bluetooth speakers that sounded great this one not so much 
1,i ve had this mouse for almost weeks now and and loved it until just yesterday the scroll wheel developed loud grinding popping sound every time you use it will definitely be sending this junk back and get something else 
0,i ve had these for quite some time now and they ve stood up against use by myself in my year old and year old my only problem is that they do not work on my ps however they work fine for my xbox one with no need to buy anything extra not sure exactly what missing for them to not be working other than that which is disappointing considering wanted one pair for all my systems they work nicely for the price and look good 
1,i love this keyboard so far awesome colors great ergonomics really good for gaming as well my one complaint is the position of the enter key could be little closer to the pinky other than that this is the perfect keyboard 
1,my son loved this headset thought the lights were awesome and had great sound perfect for gaming and virtual learning 
0,this product has been advertised as having led capability and it does but the lights are not bright enough that was the whole entire purpose of what had purchased this set for disappointing and considering beginning return plus the led lights engineered into this unity are barely colored purple and that is what classify as entirely weak kneed lackadaisical engineering prowess disappointing 
0,bad sound
1,overall love this mouse the size weight clicking is all fabulous however ve had two of these now and the middle scroller has randomly fallen in without rough use it wasn dropped literally was not even touching it the second time and heard it fall if you need to use the middle scroller lot do not recommend purchase if you don use that feature then it great mouse

1,for any headset as inexpensive as this headset its actually good one it didn have the best quality like what normally get but didn expect it to be very good it felt as if it was kind of crushing my head from the cheap foam earpiece and the foam piece that rests on top of your head didn make it that much better could only wear it for about minutes to an hour before hearing the pumping of my heart the audio wasn the best but it definitely isn the worst audio the mic is great and my friends said the only difference between my mic and this one was it was quieter the adjustable function for the headset is what disliked the most each time adjust it it always made loud cracking sound from the adjusters and each time felt as if was going to break or snap it in half because of how hard you have to pull to adjust the thing in all wouldn generally recommend this headset know it cheap option but have found lucid sound headsets or other main brand headsets as cheap as this one that have lot better quality than this one giving this one stars mainly because its cheap option for gaming but could easily give this since can find better options that are as cheap as this headset if you are looking for good headset that will last long time recommend corsair voids or just any more expensive headsets aiming around 
1,these headphones work great the mic is decent but the sound quality is the best part of these headphones 
1,at first it felt cheap but pretty much like all other perfect for what needed 
1,love it
1,i like this keyboard because it is quiet when you type on it and the backlit colors make it more enjoyable worth the money spent on it 
1,loved the backlit characters
1,first the left mouse click is not sensitive enough requiring longer press than usual for the mouse to register the click annoying and betting it will shorten the life of the mouse because you have to press harder longer another less significant annoyance make sure you don turn on the light feature it looks cool but the thing acts like lava light night light continually changing colors of light even when not in use even with the computer off which will run down the battery like the rechargeable feature but will be looking for another mouse 
0,product was great just the delivery was horrible this is the first time ve ever had issues they crammed it so tight in my mailbox like to have never gotten it out and could ve damaged my product just by trying to get it outta the mailbox 
0,we bought this for my son as gift and after the excitement he went to use them they have low sound no noise cancellation just horrible headset the only thing it good for is aesthetics 
1,it great keyboard keys are little difficult to press sometimes more like typewriter overall do like the keyboard
1,i got this to better hear players in ps titles such as vigor apex and dayz it functions far better than my old headphones the sound of my neighborhood is less distracting with the noise cancelation and the headphones fit me much better and more comfortably 
1,this product works great my husband loved it 
1,we are really enjoying this speaker the connectivity and sound are great 
1,the headphones are amazing bass boosting is insanely good however the microphone in little over week of having this headset began to crackle and cut out my friends kept telling me they couldn hear me or outright telling me that all they got was static and crackling tried everything from updating my drivers to tampering with sound settings to reseating the audio cables into different ports the only conclusion was left with was the cable was somehow so poorly made that it failed in just over week am extremely disappointed could ve spent somewhere else four and half stars how 
0,misleading information purchased this as gift you can only use the lights or the microphone and speakers on the ps you can use them at the same time unless you want the console on your lap very disappointed 
1,the colors and sounds are really great 
0,used for gaming 
0,i like that it rechargeable unfortunately the scroller on top doesn work used with both my macbook and laptop 
0,cheap charge barely last long and charging stopped working after couple of months don buy 
1,this is the best mouse and love that it is rechargeable haven had lag problem unlike mouse that requires batteries loved it so much bought another 
1,works great it little too small and would stress my hand if used it all day everyday but don so keeping it and am content to be more specific the buttons are not directly below my fingertips which would be solved by longer mouse or an ergonomic one that has little more height to it an averaged sized male and to my knowledge my hand is typical of that size of person haha hope this helps 
1,i like that you change button on the back so it stays red and that the blue light stops showing once its done charging the only thing is wish it would show you how much battery it has left 
0,i have had this mouse for about seven days and it is not track well if there delay and it only broken the click button has already broken my advice if you want something very sleek it great sleek mouse but it not reliable don cheap out and get better mouse 
1,we love this speaker highly recommend sounds is great and it really is waterproof 
0,my wife complains about how it charges sometimes it doesn get full charge that might have more to do with how she goes about it though one concern to be aware of though is how the watertight flap can pinch the charging connection she puts another usb cable into the out port to keep the flap off of the usb in
1,this speaker is great purchase it sounds wonderful charges easily and has great sound
0,usb plug is short and doesn reach most ports if you have the audio jack plugged as well 
0,this headset died after less than month of regular use no loud music only used for gaming voice chat they just randomly died total junk save your money buy something else 
0,it worked very well till it didn anymore bought this in january and it won charge or do anything very disappointed
0, stars for the weight
1,speaker was perfect addition to our home whether you re listening to music by the pool out by the garage or in the shower 
1,it serves the purpose of playing loud clear sounding music
1,ok clearly this device is not an audiophile one arguably no bluetooth device is guess but really the high end is very lacking almost muffled sounding the low end is decent for device this size but it depends on where and how you position it against wall or corner tends to resonate better and gives better bass placed on the floor does the same and as others pointed out this is mono device 
1,great speaker and sound quality use it every weekend golfing 
0,i bought five of them this year and three already broke after few months of light use two had the plastic wheel axle broken the another one just stopped charging and not recognized by windows anymore in addition the usb dongle cover separated and got stuck in the laptop usb port this mouse is flimsy and does not last not very ergonomical as well cool lights is the only positive thing to say about this mouse but it eats battery avoid 
0,not loud enough
0,does not work
1,these are really awesome however the cord gets super coiled up and easily tangled which after having them over month it really annoying and they won stay untangled 
1,it pretty mouse just some notes plastic bit thin at the top so the color bleeds through more than the pic it fine just an aesthetic thing mouse wheel bit noisy now after some use squeeks and screetches some when scrolling battery life is fine glad can use it when charging sensitivity is off cursor moves quickly randomly as if its spazzing out thought this was battery issue but it happens when fully charged sometimes overall it fine but shouldve just bought something bit sturdier even if it was pricier gonna keep using it to get my moneys worth 
1,great for my yr old
0,nothing it great with everything 
1,the mouse lasts good while on charge as it shuts itself off good product 
0,they work great my yr old has used them for months with no problem of cutting out or static but cloth ear pieces did fall off 
0,this is great headset really cups the ears and cancels the outside sounds
1,absolutely love this sign 
1,bought these as christmas gift for my boyfriend mind you he tends to have expensive taste when it comes to technology after putting them on he scolded me because he figured they must ve costed one to two hundred dollars lol thanks amazon great clarity of sound and noise cancellation months later they still work great 
1,nice sound bought it for my husband for christmas and he loves it 
1,i have many wireless mouses mice trying to find the right one for my home office studio bought this one for the slim design in the matte black finish it arrived and have never used mouse that this quiet before it insane it feels great when use it it smooth and very ergonomic this was definitely worth the price and may replace my other wireless devices with this model 
1,i just got the item and to be honest didn expect much from it in the first place but reading reviews thought it was relatively good the clicking tends to stick mine and tried doing cps clicks per second test and out of the time clicked the test only registered can say it wasn the tests fault since have to triple click most things in order to pretty much do anything for everyday work won say recommend it but it enough for that but for gaming do not recommend this since of your clicks won work because the mouse itself isn that great quality 
0,purchased this because of it can be recharged with any usb port no batteries required it is also compact with low profile it will be great for travel because it will take up very little space fits easily in pocket without bulging out 
1,doesn do anything particularly well but overall it does everything it supposed to do be good for casual gamers
1,this is great mouse quiet responsive fun color 
1,i bought this mouse because mine went bellyup am thoroughly pleased with this one it easy to use easy to charge plus and all around nice mouse and yes buy it again

0, noise cancelation sound quality were fair 
1,definitely has sleek feel to it and the lights are pretty had it for week so far so good 
0,just wouldn connect plugged it in and was fully charged just didn work
0,bought for xbox but found it works for the pc also 
0,i have this keyboard for desk setup with my laptop which is up on the desk shelf and the keyboard is in the slider under the desk and it won register anything type from that far litterally has no range looks nice like how it feels but won work kinda pissed don have the packaging to send it back either 
1,just bought near end of july already having issues battery drains extremely fast pointer has tracking issues won click most of the time have to repeatedly click on something for it to work 
1,it good keyboard just wish could change the colors along with effect it has nice smooth key press oh and it what proof told 
1,it great all is good very good 
1,price and sound are wonderful on these headset and their definitely worth the cost have of their headsets but as stated before quality is what you pay for headset will nomally last about months months in the mositerproof covering of the foam heatset randommly started peeling off like paper matche so the form headesets will gradually peel off its really purely cosemtic for now but if your ocd like me then it will bother you that beingvsaid the company is awesome on support and trues to resolve any issues they stand by their products so still must buy
0,quality product
1,love these headphones it my third pair ve bought and the wife loves here and have pair for company quality is awesome and perfect for gaming 
1,i have the klim wireless keyboard and like it quite bit my work space is rather limited and find it handy to pick up the keyboard and move it out of the way while am multi tasking it also handy that the keyboard lights up as my eyes get tired and often forget to put my glasses on so the light up keys are helpful do wish the on off switch was in handier place however however am not gamer so don know how it might rate in that category otherwise like the keyboard for all other reasons weight size price and overall usage

1,my son loves them 
1,the pairing between speakers is easily interrupted and interferes with they are constantly cutting out probably really only good for single speaker use and not pairing of them together as advertised everything else about this speaker is awesome through it in snowbank last weekend after having it for several months and it sounded great and continued working figured if the pairing sucked then would start testing out the other features they advertise water resistance was successful test 
0,very nice for the price
0,ok
0,great sound for price no noise canceling at all besides foam around ears also need extra usb plug for lights feel it unnecessary 
0,pretty but the quality is very poor it is rechargeable which was selling point but the quality isn there 
1,love how amazon is fast and product is great
1,great speaker for the beach gets loud easy to carry and durable much preferred over our previous ultimate ears boom speaker 
1,my mouse suddenly died they were great at reaching out to me and resolving the problem highly recommended purchasing from them 
0, sleek design and very responsive and most all it sleeps when you re not using it 
1,my first mouse ordered in july started acting wild not able to control where the cursor went contacted the company and they did send me new one to replace and did not ask for me to return the first one which was great however the roller on the second mouse has now stopped working it is great looking and comfortable mouse wished it had worked afraid to try third 
1,we have had several more than head sets this one has survived the longest it is used by yr old boy who takes care of it as well as yr old might 
0,its nice not having to buy batteries all the time for my mouse only downside is when don move the mouse for while you have to click the button to wake it up sometimes it clicks on the screen and clicks on something didn want to click on or open update it died months later not worth it 
1,it pink and super light love it ton
0,stopped working in about an hour

0,good for the price tracks kind of poorly and the led colors are not great
0,i bought this for gaming and so far it working exactly as intended no problems as of yet 
0,don bother even thinking about purchasing this item it terrible does not connect to anything very cheap looking the color doesn match the description the seller is little suspicious too tried giving me refund with fake amazon gift card 
1,powerful speaker great sound
0,color is not shiny black cheap plastic material
1,the sound is awesomely fantastic jbl is worth every penny the bass is beautiful the battery is long lasting can charge it to full and don hav to charge it again for another days sometimes longer jbl is great product tried other bluetooth speakers always go bak to jbl no comparison 
0,it was cool when it worked but it stopped working in less than month there were times where would leave it on all night or till the battery died but it doesn charge and the bottom red light just blinks and then shuts off when try to turn it on 
1,nice looking mouse beautiful colors and comfortable hold for any sized hands the battery on this thing is surprising charging does take time but seriously that won be problem because this thing can last long do suggest turning this off to make sure the battery doesn drain sleep mode is brilliant but do turn it off so you won get caught off guard for when it does lose battery 
0,i work in big garage this speaker is little softy have the first one that came out in ended up returning this and making my own bluetooth speaker with the same amount of money running watts rockford fosgate speakers jbl junk
1,i kind of unsure how this has so many great reviews on my second in only months sometimes the keys randomly stop working or things like the scroll lock just randomly turn on when you have never touched it on mine the sicker where it tells you if the caps and num lock are activated is already starting to pull off again this is only after months do use it daily but that really shouldn matter also the space bar is super loud and inconsistent but if you are like me your would rather troubleshoot something instead of wasting something and just throwing it out tried contacting the company but that literally nonexistent amazon just kept giving me to the wrong site and there not number or email you go to contact them from amazon and they bring you to winter outerwear site those clearly aren the same companies would have loved some help instead of throwing this thing in the trash trying not to be wasteful here the battery will die randomly with no warning super inconvenient when you re just trying to work 
1,jbl has always put out fabulous sounding speakers bought two one on each side of the room on shelf and they sound awesome unbelievable quality for such small speaker would recommend to anyone shopping around for good sounding portable speaker to purchase at least two more if you like of these it took me moment or two to figure out the jbl connect app but once got through it wasn super hard the speakers and app take care of connectivity themselves all have to do is jam 
1,i works great it fits really good on my head the sound is really good too 
1,my son loves playing his music and the sound is great he loves the speaker and takes it almost everywhere 
1,very happy and true to its description 
1,developers really did number with this device this mouse speaks for itself it is actually just what the marketing team indicated awesome am customizable type of consumer thus enjoy my share of intriguing components that of which deviates from the mundane norm this led mouse wowed me with the illuminating colorful lighting and the smoothness upon usage very well crafted and look forward to purchasing other colors as time progress 
0,it works good 
1,the jbl speaker is excellent everything hoped it would be 
0,this lasts quite while before requiring plug in 
1,i purchased this mouse for my laptop due to the ease of having mouse verse mouse pad this mouse is very easy to use rechargeable and the lights makes it easy to find 
0,worked well but dropped it off my desk on accident and it broke and no longer works 
0, it cute and light weight but one drop and it done for literally dropped it once and it now doesn work 
1,perfect for gaming fits my year old perfect 
0,just wondering however is there way to control the lights brightness color etc 
0,bbbsbdv
1,excellent
1,i got this as gift for my husband for christmas and couldn be happier for this has good set of lights and it comes with built in battery that charges via usb my husband loves it and at it was steal and customer for life now the only minor thing about this is that it sleeps little too fast but any key waking it up makes that almost null 
0,got this to try to alleviate hand pain from using traditional mouse helped enough shape wise but the battery is so short that it doesn last day was using for work so that is problem 
1,very nice smooth feel fun led shifting color love the silent click feature 
1,excellent using for exam practice and love the lights great product 
0,there nothing to dislike 
0,i like that it is lightweight and very durable and it is quiet can use it at night or early morning and not make sound 
1,i like very easy to install and the color change on the mouse
1,i brought his product for my son he enjoys it does provide lot of isolation hearing when he very engaged 
0,horrible keyboard not wireless wired for light to work then it turns off in seconds worst keyboard have ever bought do not like thing about it
0,first the keyboard is too dim and you cannot change the led colors also could someone on earth explain why you chose red led as color and that makes night visibility bad
0,i waited while to leave review tought it would last but it didn it was really smooth and long lasting battery little did know while using it it would become apart internally the scrollwheel broke usually fix my electronics easily sometimes things just need little adjustment but this part broke and with no fixing maybe some of you are lucky and doesn break easily mine did and not even weeks of using it 
1,yeah this thing is pretty great honestly it works really well and is completely silent which really like at work don like to be constantly clicking all the time the rubberized feel is also very satisfying and mean very satisfying overall you really can go wrong here for the price 
1,is almost tiny for my hands and very light works so good and decently priced ll learn to use it for surfing the web yet let me mention it seems the curve under shape is fine for my thumb side but the pinky finger side is going to take some getting used to many times my pinky then fingers slide right under it or lift it off the surface slightly no matter how gentle think holding it in the past ve had taller models that have flair formed to keep the fingers in position in construction using stuff that requires good grip makes this like using feather barely feel makes me wonder how it would be for gaming if you got excitement and need to make lot fast moves elves would love this thing though and it scrolls and moves around so good may even make flange for my fingers and to give it some weight without an old fashioned battery weighing it down it is cool with the lights no joke good choice since many look just like this and perhaps everybody else has more grip control lol yet thank you found another fun product on amazon again 
1,really liked this mouse for the first week it then became pretty useless tried to recharge reinstall and all the other hacks still won accurately track worth beans off to the donation pile can recommend
1,slim profile love that it doesn need battries colorful

0,if have ps or do not buy it it would only be good for pc you can always hear the other person and the cord is way to long
0,not as loud as was expecting for the price that paid idk if there was something wrong with mine but it seems to loose connection to my iphone pro max after few minutes
1,if you want great keyboard without the high price then this it it is quiet unless you pound the keys don know how long the charge last as charge it at night the keyboard is spill proof spilled coffee on it and after drying all night it was working great again the seller was quick to respond to email about it not working after spilling and told what to do which had already done they stated they would stand by warranty but didn need it as for adjusting the lightening haven tried as like it as it is would recommend buy wrist support for keyboard got one for about that included one for keyboard and mouse on amazon 
0,this product is useless and the quality is abysmal have never complained about any product purchased from amazon or through amazon in the last years as customer please inform all your customers that this product is cheap quality piece of damnation

1,i got this and loved it at first it fit great to the hand and was very quiet but it wouldn keep charged it would only work for days then had to recharge it
1,love this speaker made my daughter soo happy
0,well thought it would be clever to buy two of these and rotate them however not only do they not maintain charge while turned off literally have to charge both after one dies and it not like these things last that long so that pathetic but also when fully charged and following the troubleshooting the mouse still will just flash red and not work got rd to replace the nd but that one was just as bad they are all bad this is waste of money you re better off dealing with batteries than these cheap wasteful electronic items that will just end up in the landfill anyway please don buy because you will be happy with it right until the return window closes 
1,very happy with the sound quality 
1,i love this mouse got the teal and used it for the first time today in love 
1,great sound love it
1,bought to replace older belkin that had no wheel trying to learn cad so the wheel is necessary this mouse is amazing can believe the cost my girlfriend stole it to take to work so ordering another one very impressed 
0,stopped tracking well after week of use waste of money spend little more and get better quality mouse to begin with with 
1,this barely ever needs to be charged for me have online schooling so use the mouse lot and only have to charge it every once and while its very pretty and good for the price makes no sound when clicked which is great 
1,excellent 
0,my mouse stopped working within two weeks waste of money 
1,i am blown away at how poor this product truly is at first thought it didn work at all because there was no sound but apparently half charge is not enough for there to be sound but once it was fully charged it worked once getting the product working turned on some music and the amount of bass ruined the music had to download an equalizer app just to get the music to even sound decent and not crackle took it to work the next day with full charge and went to use it and again no sound turned it off and took it home still with full battery went to try it again few days later and the battery was drained even though it had been turned off overall am impressed with not one thing about this speaker and you are proud to charge as much as you do for this product have better success buying one from the dollar store do not buy 
0,like everything about it
1,it is pretty color and works great highly recommend this product 
1,this keyboard is satisfying purchase it checks all the right boxes and is great for gaming work and everyrthing in between

0,it stopped working
1,works perfectly with my chromebook
1,amazing sound quality happy purchase 
1,i love the sound quality of this speaker was worried it wouldn sound good after reading several reviews about sound quality being just okay disagree the sound and bass this thing has is incredible my only suggestion would be to have more colors more feminine colors specifically one in darker shade of teal otherwise no complaints recommend this speaker to anyone 
1,it is exactly as depicted my old mouse just wasn working correctly even with new battery was banging on it to get it to respond this one is just as advertised changes colors and responds on just slight touch love it 
0,i in the process of trying to find replacement keyboard for the logitech and this ain it either tried another keyboard before this one and it didn cut it at all the illumination on this klim is worse than the deluxe tried first with the brightness turned all the way up and the keyboard freshly charged it is very dim and hard to read especially all around the outside edge of the keys keyboard another minus is that every time you stop typing it turns off the illumination yes it does come back on when you start typing but when you can see which keys are which it hard to find the correct key to press without messing up your work it is also fairly small keyboard little bigger than the deluxe but not much once again the old adage you get what you pay for comes into play still looking 
0,it been just over month and it already broke so disappointing because did enjoy using it

1,great product so far cool lights also not battery operated charged with usb cord 
1,works great
0,the first one they sent me was defective out of the box klim was good enough to just send me replacement obviously this must be common issue the keyboard misses when am in the flow of typing consequently keep typing passwords incorrectly to the point have to type them in notepad then copy and paste to ensure don get accounts locked or make error after error and have to type extremely slow to ensure each key is picked up the keyboard is unreliable don buy it full stop bought the keyboard in august black friday is tomorrow so this keyboard is getting replaced

0,this is cheap quality mouse after month of using the rotating wheel broke now can return it because it past the warranty 
0,i use it for work charged it and it last weeks easy to use and doesn jump around
0,although just yesterday ordered the jbl charge and so haven received it yet did some research into how the device charges on one end of the charging cable is the new and better type of usb connector usb and on the other the standard well familiar usb connector the charging port on the speaker only accepts the new type of usb connector known as usb not the standard usb that we are well familiar with however the unit comes supplied with sided cable that will plug into standard usb port such as on most or all home and office computers and also some ac wall chargers the speaker does not come with this necessary usb accepting ac wall charger so if you do not have one already you have to buy one someplace otherwise simply plug it into usb port on computer the new type of usb connector usb is better because it is the same all around that is you no longer need to worry if the jack is orientated properly before inserting it ll work no matter which way you plug it in much convenient design over the old think but am not sure that it might also work faster than the old and familiar usb connector however at least as of now there is still standard usb connector on the other end of the cable so perhaps the faster charging speeds assuming even correct on this might only be the case when these cables have the new type of usb usb connectors on both ends in any case as is it still better than the standard usb because of not having to fumble around when attempting to plug it in not only is it annoying fumbling around with the old standard usb connectors the fumbling can actually damage the insides of usb port due to repeated attempts at trying to insert an improperly orientated connector like trying to force square peg into round hole after while the inners of the port will get bent out of shape however this is much more of problem with the standard mini usb connectors commonly used with mobile phones and many other small devices 
1,worked great for week until the first charge ran out plugged it in and wouldn charge we attempted different cable different port different outlet nothing worked junk returning and buying different brand 
0,it works but not the quality was looking for also makes my head hurt after about an hour if you are serious gamer recommend choosing higher end headset

0,got it broken the scroll works but nothing else works asked to get new mouse but have to go somewhere to return it which don have time for 
1,i purchased this keyboard because it was wireless and it claimed it would be great for gaming with fast response time that my friends is joke when can actually get the keyboard to turn on it takes several moments for it to reconnect it goes into sleep mode all the time and getting they keys to respond is extremely hard do not in any way recommend this keyboard it also says feet your lucky to get feet before you start having connectivity issues 
1,second one ve bought love it
1,don get me wrong do like this mouse it smooth pretty easy to use and overall pretty great but and this is strong but if you so much as bump the usb plug in ever so lightly all use the the mouse ceases and you have to re set it up usually use my computer on the couch with my kids next to me and sometimes they bump it or my dog or even me it could be super light and it still will make me unplug it and re do it over it really annoying 
0,this is realy bad mouse iv used it for about weeks now and the sensor only picks up half of my movements the rgb is basally non existent and the feel of this mouse is realy crapy it seems can just break it with hand the batterie life is also terrible if it could not get worse then this the company actually buys the reviews by sending you money via paypal so don let the reviews make your decision

1,my boyfriend got me this as gift to help with my crafting love this color because it goes with my cricut also loved that it came with an adapter for my macbook air these newer macbooks require adapters for anything that is not charging port or the newer charging cords so seeing it come with an adapter is amazing don have to carry around my other adapter and its very easy to use love it thank you so much for thinking of us apple users

0,i used for mins and it stopped working the lights were on my pc detected the dongle but mouse didn work initiated the return
1,i just got the item and to be honest didn expect much from it in the first place but reading reviews thought it was relatively good the clicking tends to stick mine and tried doing cps clicks per second test and out of the time clicked the test only registered can say it wasn the tests fault since have to triple click most things in order to pretty much do anything for everyday work won say recommend it but it enough for that but for gaming do not recommend this since of your clicks won work because the mouse itself isn that great quality 
1,i love the colors of the led lights and the sleek size of the mouse itself but you can use the feature of wireless because it won hold single charge ve had it charged for days now and it won work unplugged 
0,not working since day one
1,i really like this mouse it small and slim so it doesn make my wrist sit at weird angle it also has good battery life think ve only charged it like once since bought it several months ago it pretty responsive and light and overall it great quality for the money it does feel little cheap and fragile because of how light it is but that doesn bother me at all 
1,this is the best computer mouse have ever bought like that you just recharge it 
0,you get what you pay for guess they were great at first but then one of them the usb port bent and broke and took the jaws of life to pull out of our usb port the second one the top of the mouse fell off 
1,i got this one flash sale so it was much bigger than thought but its really great dont have blue tooth in my car so use this 
1,i bought of these for my kids the one thing that attracted me most was the led lights once we noticed how it works and how short the cord is was disappointed keeping it because they still like it but now have to look for usb extension to see if that helps and could feel better about the product

0,it was great product while it lasted one day woke up and tried to listen to something and it suddenly doesn work tried all troubleshooting no success the cord couldn have worn that easily think it is usually undisturbed 
0,totally deceptive they raised the price what joke nothing makes me more mad than when company puts american flags all over their listing and the label on the box says made in china why because this is deceptive marketing even if the box didnt say this how do know because the letter key didnt work and the power switch was stuck immediate return do not buy

1,this gaming headset is perfect there is no noise at all when tried it there was no noise but there actually was some noise around me the sound is so good you can control it so easy also you can mute and unmute your mic at anytime thie headphone is the best headphone for small and big gamers 
1,it cute guess it is pretty cheaply made you can just tell by the feel of it got the matte black one it charges pretty fast and lasts for hours on one charge love the nano usb plug it came with cord but just use my phone charger it does change colors and also has the option of turning the colors off with the little button on the bottom the instructions are all in chinese but using it is pretty easy the nano fits in little spot under the mouse for storage and also comes with an adapter it is quite flat so not the best for long term use like with gaming ll keep it but wouldn purchase it again for the price update have used this cheap little mouse for hours every night since got it ve only had to charge it maybe once week the charge is phenomenal still works perfectly 
0,it was very helped
1,jbl did it again another excellent speaker just like all the rest nice

1,i bought this to use at work as they only provided wired mouse charged it before taking it in and it been weeks now and haven had to recharge it yet it fits comfortably into my hand and is lightweight 
0,when my friend received the headset the jack is bent so now how has to adjust the port and not plug it all the way to hear both side of the headphone 
1,this headset is incredible for being mic quality is clear readings with minimal background noise sound quality being an clear audio levels though played apex legends and at times couldn hear audio with setup very simple and easy though it does have additional jacks for optimal audio 
0,worst mouse ever it double clicks when do not want it to the mouse barely moves and is jerky when used and often makes the cursor slide to the upper right of the screen without me moving the mouse

1,i love this mic the noise cancellation is awesome the sound is awesome and it really cheap really recommend it
0,item worked fine for month or two of light use and all the sudden it just doesn work thought the battery was dead soni charged it nothing if turn the switch off and on again it lights up for about millisecond goes dark again keys work tried to contact amzon becuse the only option it gives is return but am outside of the day window but there not taking phone calls at this time guess wasted money this one they do have an updated version keyboard that came out with right after purchased this one but wouldnt waste my money after this bad experience 
1,the sound is amazing surprising amount of base love it 
0,for this headset you have to constantly push the mouth piece as close to your mouth as possible which doesn really work well because the mic piece itself is plastic and when you are gaming you can constantly have hand holding the mic when need that hand for the game extreme caution when buying this it sound is good by itself but the mic part is awful will not be purchasing again 
0,i purchased this item to play world of warcraft also use wireless mouse and the keyboard doesn work in game if mouse usb is also plugged in wrote to klim and they were not helpful at all will probably return as it doesn work for me

1,this keyboard is extremely comfortable to type on and the backlight makes it possible to type with the lights off 
0,i have to say impressed not only does it light up but accidentally dropped it in dog bowl full of water and it still works can ask for more than that for the price 
1,keep in mind this is my first bengoo headset so assume it rare case however this was not great first impression was using it on my pc but it probably works best as console headset the headset itself looks great the speaker sounds nice and love the design for not only the aesthetic but the mic buttons on the cable as well unfortunately that all positive comments can give the setup app did not connect to the headset no matter if enabled it on windows defender or restarted the computer for it to reset not only that it takes attempts to open the app needed to end the background task of the first attempt to open it then it didn even recognize the headset at all no options to configure or anything trying to use another app for the setup was annoying and had me constantly checking the ports when finally got connected to the mic was greeted with the sound of rain like static that was louder than my own voice volume the volume of the mic itself was so low needed to increase it to the maximum value it also has default super bass feel to it that makes your voice more muffled than recognizable was hoping to replace my pc gaming headset but can say feel confident buying this one 
1,pretty damn good has nice volume and the mic sounds crisp and clear
0,we purchased this product because we heard good things about it however the battery stopped taking charge after about months we filed warranty claim and after many emails and several hours of our time sorting things out we were told there was nothing they could do because the item was manufactured the prior year and they do not go by the date of purchase ridiculous the offered coupon to buy something else from them but obviously we will not be buying their products in the future very disappointed 
0,product was gift for sons birthday initially worked great but less then month of using microphone no longer works have emailed company so shall see if replacement items is offered 
0,i bought these because play rpgs via discord and wanted better mic than my galaxy buds because sometimes they don pick up my voice from the very first night used this headset people said there was an echo and they could hear themselves on my mic it was quite distracting and ended up having to switch to my earbuds thought that was weird maybe just problem with discord but would try some solutions and see if could get them to work used them little since then and no one said anything but kept myself muted unless was actually speaking then my boyfriend complained about hearing youtube through the mic to the point where it was very loud for him when could barely hear the video myself wondered if it might be my macbook pro did some research to see if there was setting could change or anything else to fix the problem nothing did then thought about seeing if other people had had the same problem by checking the reviews after reading them convinced the headset has an insane amount of noise leakage and is just bad quality all around starting the process of returning them through amazon because don have any faith that the seller will respond or offer me any satisfaction bring on the cash offers but this review is going nowhere 
1,no batteries needed this works great and it lites up too easy to charge and use no problems at all 
0,very loud for such small speaker clear sound

0,it exactly as bad as should have expected for the price ve had it for days and it will randomly stop working have to turn it off and on again to get the mouse to begin working again the plastic it made out of is cheaper than it looks in the picture honestly should have spent few more bucks and bought something better 
1,ordered this for my little brother and he loves it plus blue is his fav color 
1,this product works intermittently ve made sure to charge it and even with full charge it won click every time when try to do so or it will get stuck with and without mouse pad

1,as advertised love that you can really hear the clicks charge it once week and use it approx to hrs week on color changing setting easy set up would buy again only thing don like is the short charging cable which is personal preference you would need usb plug right next to the mouse if you still need to use it while it charging

1,i got this for gaming on my xbox one plugged in the usb adapter and that it it works great great price for great product and would purchase again great battery life also
0,a flimsy mouse that broke down within two months of very light use would recommend spending bit more money and buy branded mouse and have peace of mind 
1,i got this for my sister for her birthday to go with her new laptop and she absolutely loves it very easy to use and adorable
0,edit the typing experience is very unpleasant particularly when using the ctrl or shfit key with another key this makes typing errors abundant and frustrating good quality and build the lighting is just adequate not too bright not too dim the year warranty is big plus still have to test battery life will update if anything changes 
1,way to quiet but comfortable tho
1,awesome
1,the sound quality is amazing rarely do have the issue of my phone disconnecting all have to do to fix it is turn the speaker on off
0,i purchased this as christmas gift and haven heard anything negative from the recipient 
1,if you get white mouse be prepared that you could get one that actually looks solid like it should or transparent like the one got guess sure it pretty interesting that instead of only the perimeter of the mouse lighting up the entire thing does but at the same time it takes the focus away from the design for the rgb it makes the mouse look cheap being able to see the skeleton of the plastic interior it even feels like mouse it only doubled the price tag bc of obvious to see rgb leds would ve liked it more if the leds at least blended colors but with an obvious wall of plastic in the way they don even do that despite its looks the mouse worked great for couple days the movement felt smooth the clicking felt good and it was quiet noticed the red laser id not shielded at all also the rgb lights stay on even when the mouse falls asleep and unfortunately after few days noticed the movement isn very good it may be okay for normal use but it not acceptable for gaming thought it was because of the low battery power but even at full power and changing the dpi around the issue remains this is gonna have to be returned 
1,love this little speaker the battery lasts forever not ton of bass but it sounds great 
1,great headphones especially for the price the sound quality is awesome 
0,this mouse is very light weight but not in good way it so light it actually feels cheap it takes lot of getting use to because it is so light after about three weeks the mouse started to intermittently stop working now it has fully stopped working after only month pay the more and get the microsoft one ve had that one for years and never had an issue 
1,i bought these for my year old daughter she has place to put them away safely and is great with taking care of her stuff today she went to plug these into her tablet th use and the headphone plug pulled out of the cord very disappointed in the quality
1,i used for gaming great headset for the price 
0,keeps sliding off and not much adjustable 
1, purchased this mouse for the style and cooler but after using it it was better than expected it is silent which prefer when using in class and the led light features makes it look even cooler 
0,spacious still have room for other items
1,my son loves it still has it
1,this headset does exactly what it advertises good sound ok noise cancelation and its great for gaming
0,the headphones themselves are okay but the microphone is horrible it not flexible or adjustable in any way so you can actually get close enough to it to sound better than muffled to anyone else in voice chat it sounds like you re speaking through wad of cotton or from another room have no idea how this has gotten so many five star reviews when the microphone is so so bad 
1,ya know for almost thought be more impressed sound quality isn bad but the bass interferes with the sound quality and makes it wobbly to where scared to play it loud ue doesn do that like others mentioned too it is mono speaker which isn great when looking for full directional quality sound
1,i have always loved jbl products and this speaker doesn disappoint whatsoever for portable bluetooth speaker this thing bumps like can hear it all over bed bath house for an apartment your neighbors might get mad if it too high the battery life is really good with many hours of use even at higher volume levels which drains the battery much faster the sound quality is awesome with great bass and clarity bluetooth connection is quick and easy and you can go pretty far away with your phone in your pocket and it won skip beat and of course it called the charge cuz you can charge other electronic devices with the usb charging plus that dope addition to an already great speaker finally the value for the money spent to purchase this and it definitely worth it price and then some the charge is and got this charge open box brand new for that an insane deal thanks to amazon haha my favorite bluetooth speaker of all time 
0,too expensive
0,stopped working within week
0,the product was quite obviously not new the product box not the shipping box was damaged and had return labels peeled off the keyboard had corner broken off and there was dust all over it the dongle for wireless use was not included nor were any cords horrible experience

1,this keyboard is nice and works perfectly the only thing don like about it is that you don have the option to keep the lighting on especially at night or playing games end up fiddling around finding out where am on the keyboard will keep it for backup but think will be looking for something with more lighting options 
1,the headphones arrived very quickly as someone who has been using them for quite few months now they are very durable have unfortunately dropped them on the mic good few times but to all surprise they have held up sound quality is good and so is the mic they do get smudged quite easily though but you get what you pay for overall solid from me 
1,used it twice was so happy with it worked great tried to use it the last days and it doesn work at all turn it on light comes on then turns off and won turn back on not pleased 
1,so bought this headphones just to check them out and let me tell this was amazed and very surprised on how the sound quality for this headphones recommend this item percent
1,bought this for kayaking after trying some other cheaper brands tried this and can say enough about sounds quality the bass hits hard for portable speaker and this gets loud like real loud love it and the battery life is second to none
1,i gotten mouse mouse pad combo at tj maxx but there was no usb to connect it to my laptop so ordered this online it was good price and shipped quickly and am so glad ordered it it way cooler than the other one bought and feels like it made better it lights up there an on off and sleep mode to preserve battery also works so seamlessly and smooth great product thanks

1,sound quality is good overall would give it stars if it came with the carrying case as the charge did overall nice little speaker for taking to the lake or camping 
1,we liked this headphones the fact that they light up look amazing the only problem is that the cable that lights it up is very short so you have to be close to the console in order to connect the light it very uncomfortable cuz if you move it unpluggs other than that my son likes it very much 
0,this worked great for while but after some months of regular use it has gotten glitchy sometimes it stops communicating with my computer the battery doesn last very long anymore it has become horrible for gaming currently shopping for new keyboard

0, was in the market for new mouse as my logitech wireless was going bad on me was red to stay wireless and had budget the logitech and other named brands were just too expensive when wanted one that looked cool and the cheaper ones were too normal looking got this one as it was cheap and the led lights were cool feature got it and it feels great it feels like an apple mouse and the buttons were really quiet and didn have the typical mouse click sound edit had to get other mouse as my first broke it was completely my fault as it had fell and was stepped on by accident since it was so cheap just bought another and it works as well as the first 
0,i bought this mouse to use with my macbook since it comes with type connector overall really like it the color matches my macbook and it slim so it fits in my little bag where keep my chargers in recommend this for office work but not for gaming your wrist gets tired since it really slim

1,this works great for gaming and normal pc games check out our youtube channel northwoods peach tree
0,my son uses these headphones with his gaming system and never complains 
0,started out and loved this mouse butwithin months it would not hold charge for more tha few hours annoying having to use it plugged in bought this for the convenience of only having to rechage every couple of days to this in unacceptable if it was even once day could handle it since like the mouse but can stand charging every few hours so sad 
0,purchased back in november thought this keyboard would have lasted lot longer when first purchased the keyboard it worked fine on my pc after month it stopped working and gave message saying the bluetooth software is outdated went to the klim website to update the bluetooth by downloading file that didn work connected the keyboard to another pc still would not work literally the keyboard stopped working after month due to the bluetooth being outdated or not compatible what waste of money 
1,the charging cord was very flimsy and won charge any more lasted about week 
1,this mouse is very stylish and ergonomic it is very responsive love it 
1,my year old son likes these headphones they work great and look nice they are also very comfortable the lights are nice touch we would purchase them again 
1,i love it 
0,no complaint 
1,amazing
1,great purchase it so cute and easy to handle 
1,i like my new mouse needed an inexpensive yet durable mouse and this one has been great so far have only used it for day but so far so good great purchase 
0,the mouse itself was fine at first worked great and liked the shape and sound but the wheel started to squeak and it always scrolled too fast for my liking and now the mouse won work at all always jumping around the screen spinning lagging or unresponsive really annoying when trying to play games it does this when the battery is getting low too not fan it works sometimes flat on my desktop but then it slowly gets worse and worse as the night goes on and now it won even read on my mousepad at all it has to be on the desktop to make it work even poorly 
1,i love it and hope you buy it love it and hope you love it too
0,beyond what expected bought more
1,i loved the look and feel of this mouse however it stopped working after only week of using it won charge at all and coworker said she had the same issue with the same mouse don waste your money 
0, this keyboard is nice for the money the colors are very cool and the keys are really quiet however the space bar is audibly loud when pressed and find it distracting also they they have configured the return key different and put the back slash key before the return key which has made the stretch harder so every time try and hit the return key am hitting the forward slash key also very irritating normally that back slash key is above the return key have attached video and pictures of what am talking about am not sure if will keep it or not 
0,the mouse itself is beautiful the lights make it better rating this because it worked good for the first few days but after that noticed that it randomly stops working even after it fully charged have to move the switch to off and back on for it to work sometimes it still lags or cuts off and literally have to keep it on charge for it to work continuously don think it going into sleep mode because it does it sometimes while actively using the mouse 
0,i am very much casual gamer but even so would not recommend this keyboard to anyone latency is awful keystrokes are either missed or repeated which means wouldn even use this for office applications yeah it is cheap guess except that you might as well set your on fire why not save little more and get something of quality that will actually hold up to the task for which you bought it also you know it mediocre junk when amazon does not even want it sent back as return 
1,since mainly draw art didn see need to have bulky gaming mouse this fits perfectly in my hand and has very quiet clicks which is ideal when drawing at night while the family is asleep the ability to switch between changing colors or just plain mouse mode is very useful for me enjoy the fact that you can turn it off with that very switch too as most mice at this price range never have that option it good buy for casual office or laid back working experience 
0,it was ok for cheap mouse it started lagging after few months and eventually quit working over all
0,battery life sound quality are top notch 
1,lights only work if usb cord is connected therefore it can be used with the computer but lights won work with xbox noice cancellation doesn work well at all but my son is happy with them overall 
1,worked great 
1,this is an absolutely awesome keyboard it wireless and doesn run on batteries and is chargeable through usbc hubby is using it for ps gaming if that helps anyone 
0,use traveling with laptop compact and thin better than standard mini mouse
1,does exactly what it supposed to great product 
1,the support team was extremely helpful had problem with the usb connection and we got new keyboard since all other methods to make it work again we re not working therefore they gave us new keyboard and the fact that they were just so friendly understanding and helpful not to mention how fast they are is fantastic thank you 
1,i bought this for my daughter who received new laptop for christmas she loves the led lights it was easy to set up and use works wonderfully 
1,great so far use it for my macbook pro and really enjoying it great touch and super lightweight 
1,let me start with what everyone is most interested in these have great sound quality for the size they have better bass than you expect but the treble could be little stronger ve turned the volume way up just to see how they handle the power and they hold up well you can blast them without worry as long as you have good source material bought so could output in stereo it bit quirky trying to get them into stereo mode but it does work however for some reason they glitch occasionally which causes dropout when playing in stereo think it has to do with the bluetooth communication between speakers hoping they can come up with firmware update to fix it don have this problem when just using speaker all in all would recommend buying these 
0,i wanted product that thought have for at least the semester since ve purchased it the ball that scrolls down up is no longer working makes mouse almost pointless to have seems am going to need new mouse 
0,haven had them that long maybe couple of months and the sound has went out on one of the headphones
1,perfect for gaming great sound quality
1,my son loves it 
0,brought for work and very satisfied
0, the wireless mouse was great in the beginning weeks later it wouldn keep charge when it did charge it would only work if it was hooked up to the charger on my laptop meaning still couldn use it then would unplug it and lights started going crazy so would turn the switch off and on to try and use it epic fail waste of my hard working money then they only give you certain amount of time to return so basically it total loss 
1,been using this keyboard for more than week now not gamer but was looking for good wireless keyboard that will relax my fingers thank goodness found this keyboard it wide quiet key pressed except for spacebar and very comfortable to use 
1,i just received this is the last week or so and it is exactly what expected turned it on it lights up keys are responsive and it even goes to sleep which really like customer service reached out with generic email hope you got it if not let us know leave review all that they also gave information about making the lights brighter and dimmer and the different settings very nice 
1,product is responsive the colors are cool easy to recharge so far pleased with purchase using for work and not gaming 
0,i enjoyed using the mouse while it lasted but after months of light use the scroll wheel collapsed mouse is still responsive but scrolling no longer works which makes it practically useless to me 
1,bought this to replace my old jbl bluetooth speaker that finally bit the dust after years of being pool speaker in the texas heat this one was major upgrade the sound is great and it connects easily every time ve used it the battery seems to last forever too which is great 
0,the slim design fits well in my small hands
0,usb part broke inside of computer hardly used 
1,it very good headset for gaming very good for nosie cancellation
0,very cute but the cursor for the mouse didn work all other buttons worked thou
0,my team usually has hard time hearing anything saying due to the headsets poor microphone the sound quality is fair and the long and bulky cord can be bit of nuisance
1,i purchased this mouse for my daugyer and live that she loves it had wireless before but nothing compared to this one easy set up too would definitely recommend this mouse 
0,center wheel was hard to roll after couple of days few days later the whole thing failed like the rechargeable feature but battery does not last long
0,good for the price 
1,my son is super happy now it game time 
1,would love it if it held charge or had backup space for battery have to constantly charge this usually every two days in the middle of my work day im over it going to go back to battery mouse 
0,does it exactly what it should do 
1,this mouse is extremely lightweight and easy to use love the lights that constantly change while you re using it the best part for me is the fact that it rechargeable just plug it into any usb plug it into my laptop at the end of the day battery usually lasts me few full days of work sleep mode is great and helps prolong battery life 
1,amazijg at all live with my roommates but could focus on my own stuff with this headset thank you 
0,my mouse broke in just four days waist of money 
0,works like it should 
0,this thing sucks you have to be to close to the system for comfort tried it on my ps and it doesn work at all for ps not satisfied especially with how close to have to be to use the head set in the ps because in order to turn it on it has to be plugged into the back and the cord to plug into the controller isn very long at all so my hands had to be right up in the ps and it wasn comfortable at all
0,it already does not work had to buy another keyboard color not very bright 
1,great headset for this price picks up very little background noise 
0,worked flawlessly for few days then the left button became unreliable not worth the hassle to return update seller emailed me saying that they had corrected the problem and offered refund if took down this review replied rather have corrected unit which would then review they replied they weren fixed yet and offered to my refund ignored it 
0,talking side did not work
0,the mouse seems to work fine and looks nice but arrived very dirty the box being dirty can understand due to shipping but the mouse itself has lint few pieces of pet hair and the track scroll is dirty as if it been used lot it was not described as used but very much appears to be and upset to pay full price for something that has definitely been out of the box 
1,love it
0,after weeks it just completely stopped working tried different chargers and nothing it was good price and loved the lights but should have just grabbed one from the dollar store if this is the quality of the product 
0,very good product 
0,it good
0,it stopped working after months
0,quit working after months can get it to work anymore charging port is messed up have unplugged it once 
1,very light weight and low for click sounds long battery life easy to pair nice feeling of touch with my hand love to use this mouse for my wot game on my laptop 
1,the sound quality is great use them out at our condo pool 
1,i really love the long battery life of this mouse was wandering before buying this stuff but once got it didn wanted to go back to other mouse even suggested my friends to buy and they are happy with the purchase

1,bought for my yr old grandson he loves the color combo told me they fit perfectly and the sound was awesome highly recommend 
1,i use this mouse for my laptop love that it super smooth and very quick 
0,a very nice upgrade and replacement mouse with no cords and no batteries perfect 
0,after removing the new headphones from package we noticed defective area in the wire fortunately the headphones are working properly just hope it doesn continue to unwind my yr son really likes it for gaming and says its great sound quality comfortable cool and stylish however it does slide off his head and he has to keep readjusting but that doesn seem to bother him gave it stars due to defect 
1,now that an old man and don need anything super fancy for my desktop replaced deathadder from with it only been using it for about hours but no major complaints so far takes little bit of getting use to because it sits so low but the clicks feel nice and seems fairly responsive 
1,this was great mouse for it price loved the colorful lights too overall satisfied with this purchase 
1,i love it soon as got it got on the game and got my first win in free for all oh the led lights only come on when plug em in ur game so
1,set up couldn be easier put the white usb thing into my computer and the mouse magically worked that all it took got the gold rose and it very pretty 
0,its loud clear and portable just what wanted 
1,this is great headset my son loves it and uses it on his nintendo switch 
0,worked for about week 
1,whereas on the charge the bass gets bit overwhelming on the charge the bass feels non existant by comparison further sound on the charge is less clear than on the charge details in your music get off faint notes disappear although the bass on the charge could be overwhelming the overall sound quality was much better further the charge is heavier bulkier than the charge despite less functionality on the charge could make phone calls but there is no calling ability on the charge if the charge upgraded its bluetooth to be better compatible with more modern devices would trash the charge and go back to the charge the only improvement on the charge over the charge is that the power button is bit easier to press 
1,it my first gaming headset and it pretty good tbh
1,works for what needed it to do but would be nice as work early in the mornings background lights could be al little brighter make it easier to see the keys the time out for sleep should be extended somewhat maybe little longer other than that does the job feels good to type on 
1,i bought this for my daughter and initially she said she loved it then she stopped using it and went back to her old mouse left my mouse at work and borrowed this one now know why she doesn use it it constantly disconnects and have to turn it on and off to get it to work then it randomly tracks on the screen when am not moving it it seems like someone else is controlling my computer unsettling this mouse is junk very pretty junk 
1,beautiful my daughter loves it 
0,it does not light up
0,received for christmas in december and it stopped working in the beginning of february while it was playing music it stopped and has not turned back on since despite being charged over night and it being month later of trying everything to make it work again no lights or sign of life strongly would not recommend 
1,both worked for month both are having issues now one won charge the other is having connection issues
0,worked well for while but then stopped working completely after months it would charge but not turn on 
0,i wouldn recommend this mouse the usb adapter came apart from the computer its junk 
1, love it plug in and go works on my work computer with no problem will purchase from them again
1,i am not gamer but love the keyboards that light up and change color finally needed new keyboard for work so ordered this one since it was such great price and am not fancy keyboard person curved piece etc and love this keyboard am probably going to buy second one for home this is perfect for me super happy with my purchase and super fast shipping stars plus 
0,the mouse worked adequately when it arrived after couple weeks it started going through periods where the sensor was unresponsive one minute and then worked fine the next at this point its mostly unusuable it has an annoying habit of losing connection and suddenly staring straight up while gaming makes fast paced competitive games nearly impossible waste your money on some other brand piece of junk mouse 
1,great sound easy to use connect plus it has great battery life 
1,i love this mouse not only is silent mouse but it is light and also changes colors on the side so far have received compliments from my coworkers they said it fancy mouse 
0,it cute mouse like the colors and it ergonomic however ve only had it for little over months and the scroll wheel just came loose and stopped working ve never had that happen with mouse so it not the best quality in the world 
1,ok like to recommend that you really think about buying mouse that requires charging via usb cable because when this puppy goes dead you can work until you charge it work from home so use my mouse from am until about pm nonstop have to charge every day otherwise dead in about two days tops so do like the mouse but unlike just popping in some new batteries and you re good to go you have to remember to charge it lol 
0,absolute crap the item doesn hold charge and after month it broke won even charge also way too small
1,i love the sleekness
1,my grandson loves it 
1,great sound system that easily connects to bluetooth use this for outdoor workouts and it total hit 
0,easy to setup just plug in the usb and it works smooth cursor movement and clicking but the wheel does not scroll very well only moves the screen few lines and then it quits scrolling all together 
0,the mouse lasted one day changed the battery it still wont turn on urrgggg 
0,it used to be good until this morning that couldn use the roller since it broken it broke on its own because it bad quality
1,good mouse can use for working at home ordered the rose gold which is pretty cute for desk decor and the lights are fun it functions well and it quiet when you click which is great
1,the product is good but if you have big ears like me recommend bigger ear muffs like runmus k
1,great sound battery lasts all day 
0,pretty but dies quick even with new batteries we returned it
0,the mouse looks great feels great but didn get more than few hours out of it before it died left it plugged in for several hours but it doesn stay on anymore despite several recharge attempts it just doesn turn on anymore 
1,great sound the noise cancellation works well 
0,i specifically did search for xboxone headsets and this came up as an option but it is not compatible with xboxone 
1,used mouse for less than week it will not hold charge used for less than hours this morning after charging for hours and it now dead but when it worked loved it it was light quiet and very colorful 
0,the mouse doesn use batteries but if you charge it it dies in like an hour its piece of crap
0,while was excited about the headset sound quality could not wear it for more than few minutes it is extremely tight as result it kept pressing on my glasses shifting them around whenever moved my head additionally it pressed tightly on my earring which became painful very quickly if you have neither glasses nor earrings guess this is good option 
1,overall happy with product
1,great sound and the battery seems to last forever only wish you could change songs from the speaker itself but it got great quality sound 
1,my three cents just the jbl charge and the portable speaker bass and sound quality are great for the price you can charge it while using it so it doesn need to be portable 
0,when received this item it was thin which is okay but it was also chipped off on the left side then simple drop and the mouse damn near shattered and to stop it off sometimes the cursor goes everywhere which can be annoying when you re working on particular items love it for the lights and how compact it is handle this item with care 
1,i bought two of these speakers and was quite satisfied at first my first would not hold the charge after quite bit of use bought second one and the battery would not hold charge contacted the company and was never contacted the speaker is good battery and customer service is quite questionable 
0,this lightweight mouse worked fine for about three weeks then it stopped working would plug it in to charge and after about seconds it would stop charging no charge no power disappointing 
1,it is amazing sounds great
1,got this as gift is the best gaming headset ve used in while
0,poor quality cheap breaks quickly doesn last long on full charge charging port already broke 
1,works great
1,item came fast easy to set up and use love that it is rechargeable and you don have to worry about constantly replacing the batteries use this at work plug it in at night to charge and it lasts all day while work with no issues would recommend this item 
0,this item did not work from the very beginning sent it back will not purchase from this company again 
0,i have only had this speaker approximately one month but it will not hold charge so am somewhat disappointed
1,picked these up for my son for his birthday he loves them they work great 
0,when first received the mouse it worked well and enjoyed the multi colors however after month it constantly needed to be charged by three months it no longer cycled the different colors but was only red now at the month mark it no longer tracks move the mouse but my cursor doesn move on the screen ve never had mouse go bad this quickly will not be purchasing this mouse again 
1,i was really impressed with these headphones they are great canceling out other noise and can hear things in game that never even noticed when played through the tv speakers great purchase 
0,this speaker doesn have built in microphone so you cannot pair it with phone this is pants on head retarded 
0,this speaker completely stopped charging after less than months terribly disappointed
1,sounds great 
0,like the mouse but having to recharge it with usb all the time is annoying and unproductive 
0,mouse is very lagging even after full charge 
1,very good quality headphones great for gaming while playing and using it is noise cancelling which is amazing definitely should buy
1,i bought this mouse to throw in my laptop bag for those times when the trackpad was too much of pain to use the mouse is slightly small in my hand but is still comfortable and tracks well really appreciate that it charges from micro usb cable great value for the price 
1,i ve had this mouse for almost month now and it great quality and works awesome stays charged for while ve only had to change it once and use it for working at home several hours day definitely recommend got the pink one and it so cute 
0,quit working within months of use
0,the mouse was great it worked very good at first but one day it suddenly stopped charging so haven used it in while 
0,junk quality have had other cheap brands these are junk quality sounds muffled basically have to scream into the microphone too
1,my grandson asked for these and loves them so do the adults in the room 
0,long lasting battery 
1,this is for doing school work and casual browsing being gamer wouldn use this for gaming for anyone who is asking but as standard wireless mouse it works great with no concerns as of yet like that you don have to replace disposable batteries and it charges quickly via charging cable that comes with the mouse as well as instructions you won need them as it very simple to figure it all out the color changing lights are nice touch that my year old loves would strongly recommend especially for the price enjoy the product so far especially for school work and internet browsing 
1,perfect sound and quality perfect for those who are looking good headset 
1,cannot go wrong for the price buttons are totally silent and feel solid same with the scroll wheel not gaming most but ve had no problems with accuracy comes with slim usb port and pretty large usb port but it allows for usb passthrough which is neat can speak to battery life yet but it seems to have great power saving features so easily recharge with micro usb note this does not have bluetooth 
0,upon receiving these was so excited to see these lit up while use them to game on my xbox the design of them is bisually appealing upon unboxing the pink looked little cheap but sure the other colors with black would have been better was saddened to discover that in order for them to light up you have to plug them into usb which the splitter for this is very inconveniently placed close to the controller and the cord is extremely short so that was big after being bummed about that shrugged it off and started gaming with them anyway got minutes into my game when sound started breaking up another minutes later and they completely stopped working tested my old headset just to be sure and the old worked verifying the headset was junk sending back and paying the extra for turtle beach 
0,mic quality is terrible people can hardly hear me through it
1,i have nerve damage in my hands so this keyboard is great in the fact that you can see hear and feel the keys also being lit up helps to find the key so much faster ve had it two weeks or so and no complaints 
0,the mouse was perfect for travel then my wheel just stopped working months ago the mouse is not even year old 
1,i had jbl portable speaker like this and it developed problems after months well past the warranty the company offered me off coupon on the purchase of my next one but unfortunately it still came out more cost effective to buy new one from amazon so bought from amazon great sound easy to charge can knock it just wish company would have replaced it for less than the projected cost for me 
0,don know about battery have not had it long 
1,once you configure this as your default it is simply fantastic sound is crisp and clear and the microphone is equally as good use it for gaming and online studying the noise deadening eliminates distractions which is very helpful 
1,good buy only thing don like is for connector for the upgraded usb is huge and hangs off laptop quite bit otherwise was good buy
1,it is really great it don need charge for days then finally dead on me love it really cute and colorful use lots use with my macbook pro 
1,i work on computers all day this mouse has easily become my favorite mouse use it for all of my computer tasks on both computers love this mouse very sleek 
1,works well he loves the lights 
0,a very reasonably priced cordless rechargeable mouse with button control with scroll wheel which is my preference rather than the macbookair track pad or the mac mouse for the desktop mac 
1,sound could be little bit better but over happy with it
1,i got this for gaming with microphone and it did not disappoint could hear clearly with comfort and talk to my friends through the game also like how it lights up 
0,at first just loved the mouse and it was so pretty when turn on the lights but when it was time to recharge and it just never recharged and tried and tried for well over day its dead and only two weeks old so disappointed so will be purchasing another wireless mouse from another company instead simply not worth my time to fuss with returning etc 
0,tried this product on three different computers could not get the unit to work on any of them charged as per the instructions and using the usb the driver was found however the unit would not operate at all 
1,bought this to teach dance at various places works well in big and small spaces sound even carries well outside easy to carry in its box which is beautiful love jbl 
0,its ok
0,the sounds is good on them
1,absolutely love these some of the best have used
1,worked fine for month won work after 
1,works great nice and smooth feel
1,great deal for the price and sounds amazing
1,for the price this is an amazing deal great sound great noise cancellation and solid mic great for gaming and highly recommend for kids no need to spend crazy money for really good headset 
1,i love these headphones just got them yesterday and im in love its so hard for me to find headpphones that dont squeeze my ears and give me headaches these bad boys do the job perfectly the sound is perfect level if dont like super loud headphones but you still get to enjoy the sound proof quality for yourself get them 
1,great headset works with every console my favorite pair have ever had
0,i really liked this small mouse for my laptop it worked fairly well but the tracking wheel soon developed squeak that rendered it unusable 
0,yes
1,nice item works very well looks amazing 
1,ps works great can hear word people say around me they have to yell for me to hear 
0,my only real complaint is that every time you actually turn the switch off when you switch it back on it goes back to full lights that personal preference know but only turn the lights on occasionally you should also know that the positioning of the colors is not changeable they are on pulsing on off or off no ability to change any of the lights which is fine by me but might bother other people 
1,works as expected love this mouse 
1,it looks dope and it sounds awesome can even hear background noise
0,worrks well
1,this thing is loud and sounds awesome had the jbl version of this and one day it just got really quite have only used the jbl once but love the sound and volume will probably use it over the stereo system in my boat which is pretty nice because this thing sounds so good 
0,after months it started missing key stokes or double entering letters you would think it would last longer than months before having issues like this it is hard to respond quickly to things when you have to keep going back to correct words that are either missing letter or have too many letters quite disappointing time to find new keyboard 
1,i use this for my laptop mostly when creating designs on my cricut works good lights up very nicely 
1,i use them for gaming the sound quality is amazing 
0,i love the look of this mouse and it was easy to install unfortunately the gold has started to peel after only month of use ve passed the return window so this is disappointing 
1,i bought this because trying to minimize the amount of wires on my desk and because the color matches my pc case but it not worth it the mouse barely works and it takes forever to get it to actually click on what you want like it pretty and the colors are cute but those are the only good things about this thankfully play with controller so it doesn hinder my gaming but if you do play mouse and keyboard absolutely don get this 
1,i needed new set of headphones for working at home hate those little ones that is often recommended like my ears covered all the way these are perfect they fit over my ears just right and the mic works beautifully bonus they light up in my fave color love that the cord is rope working on getting matching keyboard and mouse but that another story glad bought them happy 
0,i originally gave this product only stars due to difficult bluetooth connection with my laptop there learning curve figured out how to change settings and am now using it regularly like it use it in the backyard in remote area without cell service or internet end of changed review my music collection is largely on my hp laptop itunes does not interface with bluestacks so can use the speaker for all my music jbl connect uses new bluetooth that requires location access bought the charge to use on wooded property that build mountain bike trails upon there is no cell service in the woods can interface with itunes can use this product without internet if want to use jbl connect with the new ble which was not familiar with prior to purchasing this is clearly an urban android related cell service or internet service reliant device it worthless to me because of my unique desire to go use it outdoors without these services imagine it great for streaming services but extremely disappointed with its limitations other people have left very bad reviews for the jbl connect app nice idea that will probably work well with your cell phone in an urban setting but then ve plenty of other options when not outdoors the product is both under thought and over thought and find myself in the middle with very limited functionality 
1,this mouse never worked charged it fully before first use tried it on different devices never worked it turns on the led is nice but it won move or click will be requesting refund don get this not worth the hassle nor the price this is s 
0,it broke
1,so far this holds decent charge and its really nice for my wah job that requires tons of typing the space bar makes weird squeaking noise but other than that love this 
1,i charged this mouse one time for an hour and it been going for month now on that one charge the clicks are silent love this comfortable mouse edit loved it until the scroll wheel stopped working 
1,it was cute and worked super well while it lasted but about weeks into using it it just stops doesn hold charge doesn stay on of course it lasts beyond when you can return it so just don take the chance 
1,cutest stylish clean looked mouse have white monitor and white keyboard it goes very well with those also it has lights and it super comfortable ergonomic happy with this purchase

0,after two days of using the mouse went dead and would not work again no matter how long charged it 
1, awesome keyboard only issue have with it is super minor the space bar key is so loud all the other keys are just fine the space bar just doesn have enough connectors for its length so it makes really loud click 
0,i ve enjoyed this mouse for the most part it everything it mentions in the description however my scroll wheel just randomly broke after only month of using purchased the mouse for work purposes and the scroll literally broke during project 
0,the only thing do not like is having to charge it with usb sometimes trying to use it and it dead so connect to computer and can use it works best with longer cord that don have 
1,good battery life and good quality sound
0,leave it for few minutes and come back it has to be turned off and back on needs frequent recharging 
1,i really loved the size and feel as well as how quiet it was but it only lasted about months before it completely crapped out and never worked again suppose it good short term solution 
1,i love how you don need battery just recharge it great and colorfull 
0,is really comfortable and has good sound however the main reason bought this was for my work from home and desperately needed noise cancelling headphones this simply are not 
0,this mouse is terrible bought it for work its not like needed anything super advanced just something that would give me little more space than the touchpad this mouse skips when you move it and if you want to click something you have to hit the button or times it also very uncomfortable in the hand 
1,this is my second speaker and love it especially since you can connect two or more together to have music playing in every room at the same time
0,sounds good for gaming
0,works for nintendo switch
0,functional mouse but it is hard to click with fingers extra effort needed which is not good probably won buy this again

0,this worked for two days and then it broke
0,i have had this mouse for month and other than like the colors it is worthless have tried every kind of surface and mouse pad and the performance is very erratic tried recharging and it is no better and today it just died in the middle of zoom meeting was hosting am flushing it and making note to never purchase this brand again 
1,sounds good got money worth
1,for the price they re not bad they aren the best at keeping noise out or in they just get loud causing little strain on the ears over an extended period of time but overall ve had them over month and use them almost everyday 
0,my speaker won turn on it dead and useless such disappointment 
0,don get me wrong it an excellent headset however it just uncomfortable maybe it just me but the actual headphone piece is just little bit too small 
1,sounds great looks great portable and with nice design easy to use would recommend to others 
1,great
1,awesome
1,the lights only work if you use the usb plug which is not practical for video consoles like xbox and playstation sound quality is pretty good but pretty standard set of headsets without the light feature

0,don buy it waste your money 
0,for browsing
0,it doesn have solid lighting doesn match my red themed pc mouse mousepad setup 
0, 
0,i like that can use the charger it came with to charge it no batteries required 
1,work great for what got it for
0,mouse is fine but needs frequent charging
1,after doing ample research think jbl is the way to go for bluetooth speakers the sound quality is great battery life is long and it great addition to any beach trip or backyard bbq after reading lot of reviews settled on the charge bc it seemed to have the most positive feedback and least amount of glitches 
0,worked great for about week now won work love the color and that it was quiet click but disappointed that it died 
0,after having the jbl flip for several years and loving it decided to upgrade and purchase the jbl charge bought it new and once it came in tested it out however the sound quality was extremely distorted and sounded like the speaker was already blown because the bass was so scratchy even at volume am not sure if this is an issue with the jbl charge or the individual speaker received either way will be returning this product and am very disappointed 
1,works great would buy again
1,very convenient super loud love it 
1,love jbl products their sound quality is awesome the bass is decent for bluetooth speaker better than most ve heard gets nice and loud too and battery holds up for quite while very happy with this one

1,battery life is long black lighting is really nice and key typing noise is nice not too loud also good price would recommend 
1,i love this mouse its slim and fits perfectly in my hand highly recommend for daily use
0,for the price you re getting something better than most other expensive headsets do want to say that the people who can get the mic to work need to stop using the splitter that thing is for older tower pc that use pair of ports one for the output and one for the input can use these on my laptop pc and use the mic fine without the splitter 
1,love the colors
1,love this new mouse work from home for my job still and use my mouse all day everyday was originally using big bulky gaming mouse it lights up and looked cool for the last years but now my hand is starting to hurt and was ready to downgrade to something smaller and lighter saw this and had to see what it was about let me tell you love this new mouse its so small and light and easy to use the clicks are super quiet and feels so great in the hand yes it is plastic but it actually doesn feel cheap and feels like good build it very responsive and glides very smooth the only gripe is to wake of up from sleep you have to click the mouse button instead of just moving it like most items but that very minor issue oh and the different colors it comes in is nice also the rgb color changing lighting is very nice effect definitely recommend this mouse for home or office use 
1,for the price not so great disappointed seeing the good reviews and not hearing the delivery apologize for bad review but expected better than this for the price size is good to take anywhere

1,fits comfortably and it is very pretty 
1,it is pretty color and works great highly recommend this product 
0,just very bad mouse alk around 
1,i like this mouse because of the leds and the color but the usb converter that it comes with is not reliable had to use different one in order for the mouse to be usable have also noticed sometimes lag in clicks so wouldn suggest this for gaming or something where you need to be super responsive and precise

0,do not buy does not last for more than hrs on full charge thought the first one was defective since its advertised hrs of battery life flat out lie 
0,for gaming and sleep mode helps out lot in college
1,this gives amazing sound the bass is clear heavy sound and the treble is crisp and sharp the volume is amazing too could fill room or patio the battery life is great many hours per charge the fact that it waterproof is an added bonus also my phone found it immediately no messing around or effort needed great buy for the price 
1,the mouse is colorful addition to my desk and unlike other computer mice have owned it does not have thumb operated controls on its left side where left handed person like myself would unintentionally press button and start function they didn want to activate ve only had it for about week so it remains to be seen how frequently it needs to be recharged the light display draws significant amount of power so need to remember to turn the mouse off whenever shut down the pc 
0,pretty cheap keyboard not really mechanical at all 
0,for some reason thought this took batteries but it doesnt it has an on board battery that takes usb to charge no big deal have note and keep charger at my desk got it because its waterproof and work in bar accidents happen haven used that feature yet but ll update if do battery life is good lights look cool but you can turn them off if you want buy again 
1,cute and comfortable design but quit working after month save your money

1,i just got it today and immediately paried my phone to it to listen to music and was very impressed with the bass sound and how clear the sound was it little bigger than my sister jbl flip and in my opinion think it packs bigger punch when it comes to sound and bass 
0, like the color thought it was going to have changing colored lights it only close red which was disappointing it also kind of flat and smaller than expected overall mean does what need it to do 
1,i really want to like this mouse even more than do the colors are cute but it has flicker that just goes consistently wish could continue to use this but think am going to have to get something else the flicker drives me nuts charged it fully and there is no reason it should not work when just got it today it would also be nice if the charge cord was long enough that you could use it while it was charging 
1,works great and the lights are bright 
1,very nice headphones kids use them for gaming as well as headphones for their ipads great sound quality 
1,best portable speaker ve ever bought or heard take this thing everywhere perfect for camping fishing in the backpack hiking in the bathroom showering recommend and purchase again

1,product looks nice the cord is long and they are lightweight the led lights are nice this is nice entry level headset for gaming 
1,i needed couple of these for my kids for their laptops knew they would like the vibrant colors the mouse shows while you are using it and that would love the rechargeable and quiet functionality the mouse definitely has exceeded my expectations of it and couldn be more pleased at this product the ergonomic fit and soft quiet buttons make the experience using this mouse very easy going ve burned through many mouse myself some very expensive name brand ones that should ve done their job and then some but ve always found defect in them down the road so far so good with these and could see the durability of this product especially given my twin year olds will use them to their fullest great customer service to top it off and highly recommend this mouse for anyone in need of one or is looking for the right one

1,these headphones are really good can hear everything in the game and the noise outside can barley be heard id wish it came with stand option but outside if it the product is good
1, update still liking the keyboard after months of daily use my only two issues are the button location is terrible am mostly used to it at this point but still accidentally press instead of enter all the time although the battery life is good there is no indicator for low battery this means the keyboard will just unexpectedly stop in the middle of typing when it dead have been using this keyboard daily for the past three weeks use it about hrs day during the work week and have had to charge it twice since getting it pretty good it is by no means silent keyboard but it is much quieter than my previous keyboard and is not disruptive to my office mate husband am reasonably fast typer wpm and the keyboard is responsive don expect it to blow your mind but you will be pleasantly surprised at the quality you are getting for less than 
1,great value
1,sleep mode helps the charge last longer and it great for the wrist 
1,so far so good
0,this lasts quite while before requiring plug in

0,died within the first month of use nice mouse wanted to use it instead of the trackpad on the laptop too bad it didn work for long 
1,overall really happy with this purchase the keys feel nice and are quiet someone else review said that the space bar is very loud and while it is louder than the other keys it not obnoxiously so the battery seems to keep it going for very long time and still works while it charging my biggest issue which is not actually big deal is that could change the settings for the backlight time out the lights on the board go out after seconds wish could edit that so they stay on longer especially since the keys are really hard to see it dark in the room and the light is off another small detail wish this had included is that most gaming keyboards ve had in the past have little nub on the in addition to the and the keys like all keyboards have this doesn and find myself missing that also think it should be noted because didn see it anywhere when was buying it that the colors are in rainbow pattern seen in the photo and cannot be changed from that just assumed that could be changed but it doesn seem like it can
0,don buy scroll not working

1,love this mouse mouse came days before delivery eta which was always nice love that it rechargeable no more dead batteries mid work shift mouse connected right away to my thinkpad ordered the white and the illuminating changing colors look awesome mouse is low profile with really nice feel to it tend to run through computer mice pretty quick so only time will tell for longevity so far it for me do note with the white version the colors bleed through the top as you can see in the picture and video however still looks cool to me just different than the advertised photos 
0,this mouse was certifiable piece of crap worked until the initial charge was drained and never again do not buy this hunk of junk

1,excellent for call of duty
0,i bought this mouse less than month ago and loved it but now the roller is making terrible squeaking sound 
1,don get me wrong do like this mouse it smooth pretty easy to use and overall pretty great but and this is strong but if you so much as bump the usb plug in ever so lightly all use the the mouse ceases and you have to re set it up usually use my computer on the couch with my kids next to me and sometimes they bump it or my dog or even me it could be super light and it still will make me unplug it and re do it over it really annoying 
0,this is not compatible with the first generation xbox one
0,i thought these were really good at first but the same week went to burlington coat factory and found turtle beach headset for once tried those on noticed big difference these ones have lot of background noise there is an echo that doesn go away and just the quality it different would go for different brand returned this pair

1,looks feels great love all the colors

0,broke within week 
0,absolutely ridiculous watching the side panels go off with all this bass bass is okay out of and everything else sound like it inside tin can mono speaker ruins this product horribly 
1,sounds really good for music not what it is intended for but really good bass and sound for music slight complaints about mic but overall good for gaming too for the price cannot complain 
1,i needed mouse for my laptop for around the same price as big name mouse you can get mouse that works just as well and looks cool with it led lights and it rechargeable the lights can be switched off if they are too distracting but admit like them it isn quite as ergonomic as some mice but it fits nicely into my laptop bag usb receiver is small enough to leave in my laptop without it getting yanked out

0,quiet and smooth
1,awesome speaker 
0,not for regular or big hands
1,the keyboard feels good when typing it accurate the backlight is good touch is good touch and allows for typing in dark places the size is good my only complain is that the keyboard is not silent at all even though it advertises being so unless you do words per minute then you won be typing silently 
1,my son got these for gaming and said that his friends have told him that they have never heard him more clearly and my son says the same about them great pair of headphones and shipping was fast

0,mouse takes long time to connect and spend way to long to try to make it work it got here fast though
0,son is satisfied 
1,it has great bass
1,cannot use the product due to false marketing had to research this product extra and finally found that the last picture shows chart again on the last page saying an adapter is needed the original page on amazon shows xbox one is supported as it comes that is false marketing 
0,enjoy using 
1,perfect for day at the beach or river or anywhere bit bass heavy but am partial to that surprising bass response for such small unit charge your phones and still bump all day who made such witchcraft 
0,excelente
0,this speaker snaps and pops when at low volume and distorts when turned up tried multiple apps and devices but had the same result dud at over is unacceptable would not recommend this product in any form or fashion 
0,sorry usually dont leave bad reviews but this one takes the cake it started working at first but then it started to be very laggy and then no longer worked now am using brand new macbook so maybe it the usb converter that might be problem but currently not fan

0,took it out of the box set it up minutes later it stopped working completely 
1,microphone is super faint and far away people can barely hear at all
0,battery and charge functions step up from next model down in the jbl bluetooth speakers sound appears to be same quality as model below this one heavier than lower model bigger because of battery if you don need the features of the battery and charge options go with next model down in the jbl bluetooth speakers and save and less bulky
1,love the size feel and color of this speaker it was very easy to connect to my phone and ve been quite impressed with the sound quality even more impressive is the battery life of this speaker can go days to weeks without charging depending on how much play music like that you can charge your phone off of it too 
1,great
1,great
1,great value for the price
1,not as loud as wanted it to be great for room
1,the price of this mouse was cheap and you will get just that with this product it serves its purpose ok like the color changing led lights but this mouse is too lightweight for my liking and my hand is too big to fit on the mouse comfortably it feels like there is lag when moving the arrow just an overall not great feel compared to my mouse on my work office computer 
0,for the price good product have not used it much yet but will suit the purpose for small portable mouse 
1,my daughter loves it cute color and works great 
0,had this one for week and it already stopped working the scroll wheel in the middle doesn work and half the time the items am trying to click on can because the left click button doesn work have charged it several times from the computer and from wall adapter and still not any better
0,exactly as described
1,fantastic
1,works great with my xbox
0,i found one of these on the street back in the winter that had fallen off someone bike or car after unsuccessful attempts to find the owner ended up keeping it figured after being dropped and rained on it wouldn work but it did the sound is maybe not the best you could find but it not at all terrible if you want something rugged that you can take to the water this would be good speaker 
0,this is the worst mouse ever 
1,this headphones exhibit great quality sound and mic clarity the cushions on the headphones make them comfortable enough to wear for several hours they are well designed and highly ergonomic the headphones also do great job of cancelling background noise 
0,but the item jul months didnt chrage it more than times yet the charger broke its nice but wont last
0,i really liked using this mouse it died hair quicker than like but would just use it wired while it charged up however month after using it the middle scroll circle clicked down and wouldn come back up making it impossible for me to use as use that often in playing sims didn expect much as didn pay much but was slightly disappointed 
1,i was super excited when received this mouse with it comfort and of course the pretty led lights were cool it came fully charged worked great until after charged it for the st time strange it no longer worked could see bit of red inside but the led were gone and the curser wasn responsive to the mouse against better judgement agreed to receive free replacement giving it another chance so ll follow up with nd review follow up nd one worked for weeks and then stopped working altogether the company actually contacted me after submitting my initial review offering full reimbursement if take it down followed by instructions on how to do so didn end up doing it glad for it since this one was even worse ughhh why do companies insist on selling products like this 
1,the best ergonomic and lightweight feels comfortable after hours of use at my laptop fits perfectly in the pocket of laptop bag not bulky like others ve tried stays charged for long time love the color 
0,this mouse was terrible it worked very inconsistently and have already replaced it with one that actually works it was very disappointing 
1,when received product knew it was what wanted nice raised keys nice crisp click then of course after throwing awaythe box and packaging and really getting down to using it irealized the cap key does not work urgh my mistake for sure make sure you use it for while before discarding anything 
1,love this remote the slim design fits perfectly in my hand love the changing rainbow colors and the ease of using is absolutely awesome would highly recommend this remote to anyone with pc mac laptop
1,better than the headsets ve bought definitely buying these from now on use on xbox series x
1,this keyboard is great was using it so quickly just plugged in the usb dongle and it was ready to go the lights are so pretty and the board is so lightweight this is easily transportable it has switch which allows you to shut of the lights if you choose my daughter was so excited when she realized that besides the pc she could also use on her xbox it would actually be great if this could come with multiple dongles so it could be used on more than device at time however it so easy to switch that it really not such big deal to do it yourself it charges really easily too for the price this is good buy 
1,the klim chroma is an excellent gaming keyboard for the price 
1,i love it easy to install and use mouse is soft and movies easily 
1,i like the fact that don have to change batteries and just plug it into the connector do jigsaw puzzles on line and it works great
0,stopped working within week
0,there is no audible warning when the battery is low the indicator lights are at the bottom of the speaker the way you know is when the speaker turns off in the middle of the night and you fumble with the charger while the speaker keeps turning off until the battery gets charge sound quality is nothing special considering the price and the jbl brand 
1,my kid liked these headphones for his gaming system but really like them for doing my telehealth video sessions for work 
1,great product 
0,at first really loved this mouse fast connection and worked well but like several other reviews mentioned after about months it just stopped working it didn charge or anything it just literally stopped working for that alone would rate it bad pedi to because it doesn last didn drop it or beak it it simply stopped working 
0,the plug to use in macbook does not work really needed this mouse so had to go out and buy plug myself spending more money for what this should have come with it working now but only because spent more money 
0,it doesn move used for days and gave up really bad 
1,i got this in the mint green color and like that color the only issue is that it broke in about month so if you really need mouse for your laptop but if you want cheap one then don really recommend this product 
0,the technology is great but ergonomic it is not
1,not sure for games but its really comfortable and pretty cool with the colors
0,i use this mouse every day at my desk it has very long battery time limit and working amazingly highly recommend
1,very sleek looking as pictured love the color good product
0,a solid keyboard for the price the battery life is not very good and if you use your computer lot it sort of defeats the purpose of it being wireless the keys are not silent although they are more quiet than most standard keyboards the backlighting provides nice visual but contributes to the poor battery life on single charge however the light level makes the keys very visible in dark or dimly lit room if the rgbs are important to you consider keyboard with more programmability because this one can only switch between off on and glow with options to toggle light level and glow frequency 
0,the microphone doesnt work with ps went through all of the troubleshooting steps twice and the mic is digital garbage at best and completely unresponsive at worst wish had looked deeper into the reviews before adding to my wish list and having people waste their money on this product
1,sound is amazing and design is beautiful 
1,solid wireless keyboard and the best bang for your buck very mobile and responsive crispy boy spill proof 
0,it was made of cheaper plastic then expected and refused to charge after it ran out after the first time wasn enough money to make it worth my time trying to return it the color change was cool was it lasted 
0,i had hbo products before always been satisfied
0,i ve only had this for few months now and it is completely broken the scroll feature lost its traction and no longer works the battery life wasn great and it never worked flawlessly need new mouse now 
0,first one mic mute does not work returned got new one but same product headset doesn work going to return
0,ergonomic
1,these headphones are awesome they re great for the money they cancel out the noise they work perfect they were just bought for my significant other for work and she loves them am willing to bet they would great for gaming though great sound 
1,love

0,ergonomically find it to be too short and bit uncomfortable bought it as travel mouse so could over look that except that it barely works every time have tried to use it it eventually gets super laggy and almost impossible to use turning it off and on again fixes it but only until it starts to lag again 
1,responds quickly feels nice in my hand battery lasts long time 
1,i love it
0,cheap plastic feel right out the box the audio would cut out just from moving the wire even the most basic movement caused it to short out horrible sound quality when it did work even at the highest level it was barely audible got the headset because of the high ratings but looking at the lower scores it would seem that my issue isn an isolated occurrence 
1,i use this guy all day every literally work in remodel and have it playing from and then use it at the weekend to for grilling out on the boat or riding my bike sound is great good bass for little guy and gets loud enough for what you need from speaker this size easy to charge and last long time only wish it would tell you when the battery was low with noise and not just die on me 
1,feels nice in the hand lightweight but not lightly made if that makes sense smooth flow nice to have the usb compartment inside of the mouse use it for my latop when travel
0,didn work sending back

0,i rarely write reviews but this little bluetooth speaker from jbl is gem ve got high end setup in the family room and picky about sound it hard to believe the depth and bass from this little guy it actually projects decent soundstage too it on my desk and improving the quality of my days at work crank it up between calls bluetooth connect is instant and battery life very long take it out when grilling and hanging the yard very portable and gets loud without distortion how did jbl do this 
1,the mouse is very light and easy to use and the changing led colors are very nice to look at 
1,to me personally this item looks so however bought it for friend and she says it works perfectly and makes her desk area look alive

0,easy to use charge lasts long time
1,doesn stay connected hard to tell when charged has to be charged constantly which negates the convenience of cordless it looks cute and feels good but obviously cheap plastic am returning it to buy different mouse with better performance that uses battery so does not need to be hooked up to usb port and charged constantly fyi on seller emailed me and wanted me to remove the review they say they are switching manufacturers let the buyer beware 
1,works great with macbook pro thanks 
0,battery finally died for the first time after about weeks sets the bar pretty high resistance is perfect and not loudkeys are bright enough to be cool and visible but not blinding in the dark charges relatively fast and you can use it while charging first delivery didn show up but amazon worked it out with me

0,great sound and mic quality have of them only consistant issue on all were the mute switch either didn work or stopped working 
1,it work super great recommend for other to buy
1,my son loves them 
1,this speaker has stellar sound quality for the money the base is fantastic for the size of the speaker actually didn expect it to sound as good as it did it is waterproof which was just what we were looking for it hard to finda good waterproof speaker that will truly withstand more than sprinkle of water but this one passes the test our teenage kids love using it to bluetooth the music from their phones out by the pool so you know it has seen it fair share of water it also comes partially charged which was nice we had music within minutes of taking it out of the box it lasts about week on charge if we use it intermittently ve never left it on for more than hours at time so can speak to how long it would last continually off of single charge 
1,works as expected great product which use at work all the time
0,it does not work and have tried to reach the seller instructions in chinese and simply poor poor service purchase at own peril great disappointment for my kid 
0,keyboard works well charge only lasts few days and have not been able to use it while charging there is no warning to let you know the battery is about to die keyboard just stops working while your typing
1,this is good product it fits well in my hand and love that it is rechargeable would buy this mouse again don use it for gaming since that is something don do it serves my purpose well 
0,this is by far my favorite mouse can wake up my computer by tapping the button on the mouse goes to sleep saving me bit in new batteries if didn notice the mouse sliding off the laptop and onto the chair laser up would be changing the batteries frequently this one recharges no batteries to buy 
1,i purchased these for my son he really loves them best headphones have purchased 
0,junk
1,i ordered for both girls they seem to like worth the price
1,this mouse captures the eye because of the constant changing colors also like the feel of it it not bulky and big think its great investment good for kids and gaming 
0,provides good volume range 
1,the mouse is well built and works as intended the led lighting is pretty cool step above the daily dull plain mice out there 
0,ordered this mouse in mid may in june it started acting bit off and could only use it turned on to one certain position yesterday august th the roller ball on top stopped working and now can scroll screens without using the sidebar very disappointed in how quickly this mouse stopped working my grandmother always said you get what you pay for and in this instance she was correct 
1,the controller on the wire is nice sometimes the wire gets in the way when gaming it takes second to get used to the headphones after you put them on they are nice can comfortable not good at noise cancelling but otherwise they are great 
1,love it such good sound and works everywhere
1,stellar sound and built like brick easy to sync to my phone and lasts forever use it every morning seriously and people love the sound very clear and sounds great low and at high volume
1,this headset is very nice and comfortable
0,quite charging so now it paper weight 
1,perfect mouse silently working
1,i had an issue with the first pair but the return process was fast and easy plan to order more for my nieces and nephews highly recommended item arrived fast and as described
1,i bought these because have radio show and have to do my show from home they pick up my voice pretty well and the sound is really good 
0,nice mouse but have had other rechargeable and this one seriously lacks uptime getting about few days and dies quickly my first one would last weeks but lost it at conference should have went back to it 
1,greatest
1,i purchased for my kids to use while doing online class work it was easy to set up and seems to work well was hoping for something that felt more sturdy it feels very cheap the kids love the changing lights while they use the mouse my only complaint is that if they don remember to turn off the noise after use then it dies and has to be recharged before if can be used again
1,if you want quality sound to blast while you dance on your own while cleaning the kitchen or working on super dope motorcycle in the garage or while you roast mores up the canyon around toasty bonfire while celebrating the joys of lasting friendships buy this speaker it small enough to toss in backpack and big enough to pack an audio superpunch the battery life is amazing and can go days without charging it bluetooth connection is great and you can pair it to multiple devices which is huge win for jbl would buy again 
1,awesome
1,this one sound so good had to buy second one always outside grilling relaxing and this is perfect for my little carport set up carrie good bass but still doesn fall flat when you want to play some rock like queen or led zeppelin it so well rounded second one is for surround sound 
0,mic is too far from mouth and not adjustable
1,like that this product is waterproof camouflage that about it the jbl charge is better product thought the would be an upgrade but in my experience in less than year the speaker now won hold charge my charge had had excellent sound long battery life only crocked because the charge port became loose after years of hefty use very displeased by the fact have to constantly charge the the sound quality doesn seem better either ve only used the charger the came with too with the was able to use the universal android which was handy 
0,cheap quality 
1,love it works great with the switch
1,if your looking for wireless gaming keyboard that won set you back few hundred bucks this is the keyboard for you honestly was expecting piece of junk for the price but also didn want to spend bunch on an expensive gaming keyboard as im not an avid player this keyboard is quiet easy to set up and boy its cheap even if you dont like it you can always give it to someone and they probably would appreciate it 
1,forget all the other expensive headsets this one does it all for much less my kid has been so happy with the headset he recommended to all his friends you wont be disappointed 
1,this thing works well most of the time if you don turn it off and just let it go to sleep mode it dies fairly quickly but you still get couple of days of use out of it if you re not using it hours day at least if you turn it off every time you re done though you can get probably month but at least weeks out of it with moderate use originally bought it to use with my ipad however the case on my ipad wouldn really allow the usb to plug into the charger port wish they made an option to get either usb or usb plug as you get both with this mouse but you have to plug the usb into the usb adapter which makes the usb plug significantly thicker than necessary now use it for my macbook just warning if you want it to scroll like regular mouse you have to change it in the setting of the computer but that macbook problem not problem with this mouse not all of apple setting decisions make sense but that nothing new do really like that can chose to just turn on the mouse with solid red color which preserves battery or turn it on to change colors reduces how much time you get out of the mouse but is cool feature my only complaint is that sometimes the mouse isn tracking perfectly and the cursor is in completely different place than would expect it to be further behind where was moving it to rather than the cursor doing its own thing but that may also be thing have to change on the laptop 
1,once followed the instruction for xbox to turn up my media in the home menu it was the best pair of headohines had just wish they were wireless however cord is long enough to anywhere with you
0,wouldnt work with ps
1,this is my second jbl charge live the sound and the color is fun 
1,bought this mouse because when my other one died remember having to change my battery at least once month after getting this originally charged and has kept the charge for almost month now and just had to recharge for the st time charged overnight and working great again love this small quiet mouse easy to hold with rubberized texture that keeps it from slipping 
1,i was looking to buy portable mouse for travel and was going to buy regular battery one but saw this pop up as an option really like the mint green color it affordable easy to use connects fast and very low profile the clicker is quiet too scroller works great as well charged it up connected via usb to my dock station and it was ready to go love it

1,these charge speakers are great bought more to go with couple already had they easily sync up with each other which makes it easy to fill larger spaces with great sound if you put them in corners they sound even fuller wish that the charge still had to ability to take phone calls but guess that isn that big of deal the batteries have listed all day and more it is also handy that can charge my phone from them as well 
1,i bought these headphones on lightning sale wanting decentish set of headphones with mic pleasantly surprised with the good quality of the input and output would recommend if you re looking for good set of headphones without breaking the bank 
1,this is my favorite mouse because of the color and lighting it is so cute and comfy to use there is charger to charge which prefer over battery 
1,these do not fit on the head well my head falls under the size fits most category in terms of hats glasses and headsets this does not additionally they do not cancel any noise at all finally the one received had to have the mic put right to my mouth to pick up any sounds no matter how much played around with the settings understand that this is cheap pair but that doesnt mean that the product shouldnt work sound quality is alright

0,it works ok nothing spectacular if you re gamer or use the mouse quite bit you have to charge it about once day or it starts lagging and causes things to crash or freeze up due to the lag 
1, bought one of these from this company and it stopped working within the first weeks messaged the seller upset because could not return thought maybe buying the upgraded version would be best option before making large complaint because it was nice mouse for the little time was able to use it big mistake the second one stopped working within weeks of using it continuously can return if either to receive my money back or receive replacement it frustrating because of the fact that work from home and need mouse am going to make complaint through amazon itself but wanted to warn others not to waist your money good luck

0,really like the mouse until months in it started having issues just trying to move the cursor across the screen became struggle 
1,i really love how easy it is to setup this mouse nothing to download just plug and play have been looking for slim mouse that works on my mac and windows machine that doesn need batteries or mousepad and this definitely fits the bill the lights are cute fun addition but are subtle enough to not be distraction while using and don seem to drain the battery too much overall think it great for anyone looking for something easy to use 
0,you can hear buzzing noise when plugged in and people can hear you all they hear is echo when you try to talk this mike is over all trash

1,i like the ergonomic design of this mouse and so far find it easy and smooth and to use can work on it all day long tiredlessly

0,size is just right for me
1,the mic does not work but the sound quality is great
0,i purchased this item because of the backlighting planned to use it in our living room at night to interact with our tv the backlighting is great like the feel of the keyboard but yesterday connected it to my desktop was having problems when would hit the return key with my left pinky after comparing the klim with the worn out logitech am replacing found that there is an extra key between the quotation mark key and the enter key the backslash key has been moved down row if were hunt and peck typist suppose this would be fine but learned to touch type years ago use my touch typing skills many times day why would want to teach myself how to find the enter key all over again to press key thinking that am using the enter key and then finding that have backslash or that the item failed to load is maddening dislike giving low score to such good looking keyboard but if buyers have the same concern as do they need to know what they are buying would also prefer larger delete key 
0,we tried and have hard time trying to connect then it disconnects no light power for the macbook so don use this for any apple devices it does it should work but gives hard time get frustrated better for those other computers laptop
1,sounds great the sound is well balanced the single speaker instead of stereo is not an issue at all great build quality also 
0,the scroll wheel stopped working days after bought it used it less than times
1,use for gaming like that they reduce outside noise and surround sound is great 
1,batteries would be so much easier with the way the power runs out after charging by usb frustrating because if your in the middle of something have to go back to old mouse until this mouse is ready to use love the feel of it though and the cool lights 
1,perfect sound and quality for my little market 
0,bad quality already broke usb stick stopped working
0,quit working after month not worth the money paid

1,it kinda heavy but very durable sounds fantastic love it 
1,love it looks and sounds awesome 
0,no complaint 
1,stoped working after few weeks it won charge 
0,ergonomic for gaming
1,it cool gadget just don like how can have it lit whilst playing the game 
1,i love this mouse it has cute and ergonomic design and doesn need to be charged often the only thing don like about the matte black one is that it shows fingerprints easily 
1,he has had these headphones for year now and they still work great
1,i love this mouse love the led colored lights the most another one of my favorite is that it is magnetic and sticks to my laptop when in the car or at the local coffee shop 
1,bought as gift and seemed to be received well love the color
1,everything is good best headset
1,love the color love the sound blockout
0,the aux input doesn work properly the sound keeps cutting out this is simply bad design and when contacted jbl support about this here was their official response our jbl charge normally goes on standby when there is no sound coming out of the speaker for while this feature can be turned off they called their poor design feature much in the same way faulty brakes on car is feature they also solicited me for star review and incentivized me with gift card so stars 
1,both worked for month both are having issues now one won charge the other is having connection issues
0,the usb broke off in my computer and had trouble removing it finally got it out with finger nail clippers was happy with it until this happened 
1,this is great headset sound quality is great both on the headset and on the other end of the microphone comfortable padding on the band across the top of my head and on the ear cuffs as well great purchase 
1,we love love love this speaker great sound great battery life love that it water proof so no worries at the beach or pool 
0,like the light weight and wireless battery life is good too too bad today my and buttons stopped working have tried in my laptop and my pc and both have the same results guess since am out of my return window will try to contact the company and see if they will service it and if not will just open it up myself and see what has gone wrong very disappointing that this keyboard lasted few months do not buy this
1,i really enjoyed listening to the audible booktrack books on this speaker the background music and sounds are so clear yet not overwhelming the reading of the books 
1,loved it 
0,just wouldn connect plugged it in and was fully charged just didn work
0,returned it
1,excellent item excellent customer service
0,this mouse is so hard to use that scrolling my documents with the keyboard arrow keys push the left button times it might place the cursor select the word or do nothing depends on the mouse gods if you leave the mouse arrow over the cursor when you finally get it where you want and if you type nothing happens this thing is trash buying logitech mouse to replace 
0,charged it for hours and hours and could never pair with my mac used the adaptor that was included and tried multiple times but was never able to use it definitely not easy to pair as it advertised 
1,the look is what sold me the price was alright and they fit good 
1,awesome quality sound love jbl products you will not be disappointed if you use this for going to the beach hanging in the yard or using for work sites also very durable
0,i enjoyed using the mouse while it lasted but after months of light use the scroll wheel collapsed mouse is still responsive but scrolling no longer works which makes it practically useless to me 
0,i just got this mouse and wanted to like it but it glitches so much to get it to stop have to turn it off then back on so can continue working will be returning 
1,i am very pleased with the quality on the device it does not feel cheap in any way for the price is lot better working that other more expensive ones is not too heavy which make it very comfortable to wear for hours in online tournaments the cushions seat perfectly around the ears isolating from external noise and making very clear the sound on the games even when these are considered entry level it is pleasure to use them while playing all my games also use them to play music and the surround sound is amazing can hear every instrument with absolute clarity guess will be updating this review as the time goes by but for now will say that am very pleased with all the characteristics and for the price you cant go wrong frank
0,works as described 
0,the wire was weak the part near the plug broke apart after months it is still functional but the wire is visibly damaged you can see the metal wire inside breaking apart the product description claims for it to have noise cancellation but that is lie every time use the headphones can still hear outside noise do not waste your money 
1,this mouse feels and looks very good as cool affordable mouse recommend it to anyone looking to buy rgb wireless mouse 
1,this wireless mode has nice sleek design purchased the matte design love that the clicks are quieter than others didn think it mattered that much but it does no problems with cursor speed or connectivity enjoy the change of colors feels more expensive than it actually is excellent price 
0,the mouse itself was wonderful it installed within seconds and was very smooth operating it fit well in my small hand and there was no clicking noise wish it worked out as liked the mouse itself the only issue is not the mouse itself but my sensitivity to the led optical lights got migraine from it the led light can be turned off so that in itself could be remedied but the optical light which is bright red showed through the side lights the gap between the switches and the dpi option switch there was no way of blocking the light was really sad had to return it 
1,great sound and color options battery life last between and hours definitely brand ll stick with
1,mouse is really good for the price smooth and easy to use also the rbg lighting looks perfect with my setup 
1,bought in february and it worked great until rd or th charge now it not connecting to my computer any longer 
0,i ve had this mouse for almost months it worked so well and the color changing lights add little pizazz unfortunately the scroll wheel stopped working it no longer has tension on it it just spins now and moves nothing on the screen 
1,really nice rat would definitely recommend it feels great rechargeable cool led colors and wireless 
0,worked amazing just as advertised but after month it has not been working anymore it not charging little blue light appears and then it dies when it charging thus the cursor works for few mins and then dies it really not charging anymore so disappointed 
0,either sound mile away or blow out my friends ears with static there is no inbetween no matter what settings fiddle with rate it if could
1,certainly helps to look at instructional pictures and to try to translate what the instructions mean
0,super unresponsive fun idea but would not recommend to anyone 
1,love how quiet the mouse is love that it came with an adapter for usb love the recharging capabilities very nice feel in the hand one thing is wish would have gotten the color that wanted wanted silver but got gray 
0,i liked the look feel and price of this mouse however after less than months of moderate use while playing game clicked the wheel and it broke this item was not made to last cheap and not worth the money in my opinion 
1,great product great sound
0,clicking this mouse takes so much force have to physically move my arm to get the leverage to do it and if ever pick the mouse up off the pad my cursor moves erratically around even if it pointed at the ceiling literally the most important things for mouse pointing and clicking are useless on this thing looks nice though 
1,this wireless keyboard is really practice and affordable just got it and tested working well bottoms feel strong and clicking is soft is not noisy and has drain holes on the back is case of water splashed if you looking for quality and value totally recommended 
1,this is so pretty fits my hand perfect the lights are soooo pretty lol it was beyond easy to set up on my laptop it came partially charged even so could use right out the box easy to charge lasts really long time too love it would totally gift 
0,very slim stays charged for long time
1,i loved this mouse until it quit working three weeks after using am unable to return it due to return window tried different mouse pads and notebooks hoping was just the material it was sensitive to 
0,i really like this keyboard the keys are soft and the back light colors are not too bright 
1,i wish it were just little louder but over all the sound is great 
0,type adaptor does not go in the computer port properly so it doesn work 
1,very nice mouse well designed and nice colors functioning well am satisfied with it 
0,really nice
0,first you can either have the headset glowing or you can actually use the mic pick one you cant have both secondly maybe its just mine but my headset is completly lopsoded crocked however you want me to say it third due to it being uneven sound quality isnt great no noise cancelation and its not as loud as would like it last its uncomfortable period
1,finally sleep mode that is done right all my other wireless mice when they go to sleep you have to click to wake pretty standard well when wake those other mice with right or left click it is active click which means it acts as if it was never asleep and either opens menu or activates what clicked always frustrated me lol well this one is super nice you click and it awake without doing an activation or selection have been looking for this in wireless mouse and have finally found it also it has nice feel not super ergonomic but nice the color selection is nice chose the grey the rgb lights are very pleasant to the eyes haven had it long enough to rate the length of the internal rechargeable battery but will update soon the cable that comes with the mouse is very short but that isn problem the dbi variety is nice as well very happy with this mouse 
0,cord is like ft long and constantly gets caught on things or tangled missed that in the description guess would not recommend for console gamers who plug into controllers cord is too long and will become trip hazard 
0,the mouse look and feel is nice and sleek but it does not slide well due to the bottom strips coming off and restricting the movement unfortunately has to go back the seller keeps contacting me offering money to remove the review 
1,amazing little speaker clear highs distinct mids and solid enough low end to satisify most people build quality is impressive definitely worth the money for this awesome sounding little work horse would recommend the jbl charge without reservation 
0,i honestly got this product not so long ago and can really speak about the durability but wasn disappointed with my purchase the battery last for very long time and the light it just beautiful 
0,ok
0,sounds break up it not loud says xbox one compatible but it not cheap quality 
1,very easy setup nice and stylish great product for the price 
0,the mouse quality is poor type adapter doesn work can work for macbook but usb adapter works 
0,don spend your money on this crap
1,this mouse is very slim and is comfortable on your wrist the colors are really cool and mouse battery goes for couple of days
1,great little wireless speaker would recommend buying it
0,bought two of these one for work and one for my personal computer in two different colors mouse worked great until the roller ball in each died one after couple months one after less than two days if you can live without the roller ball then highly recommend but if you use it heavily would look at different mouse 
1, this speaker sounds great thumpy punchy and in certain instances has deep booming bass mids highs are clear could be little more crisp and of course have more bass but it is full rich sound and using an eq brings out more of its capabilities jbl quality construction was on the fence about buying this because they went to mono driver but you can really tell difference in fidelity you can tell the bass is slightly deeper than the charge completely happy with it and love the green color one thing do not like is they took away the speaker phone put the speakerphone back that thing like and is missing on this as for connecting to older speakers with connect you can update the older speakers to connect plus to connect with the charge update liked it so much got another one camo these sound great it actually has bass no issues with connectivity or battery this is the best speaker in this class or category there are some that come close but these can be beat the price hike is downer don know what going on there that crazy got these for and that what they should be seems getting good reviews helps their sales and they take advantage by jacking up the price not cool at they aren that great would expect more at that price 
1,i got this to replace my white one that broke well let just say love it it stays charged very long time and the color change is beautiful
1,the mouse is slim lightweight and has beautiful colors the paint has started to rub off and have only used it for maybe weeks can tell it will not last too long 
1,i bought this for my work laptop and really like it the coloring changing option is fun but don turn that on very often so the charge lasts longer have small hands and it fits my hand comfortably 
1,love that this is so colorful works great with my mac
1,love that speaker last me whole day at work plus can charge my phone when needed 
1,the pads are really nice the mic rests in comfortable spot for sound it really is nice headset the ability to use single or double plug is really nice and makes it easy to switch to different devices
0,it worth the frustration if was you just get different one
1,i use this for my pc gaming and it works great
1,this little wireless mouse is awesome the color at night looks amazing love the handle my wife liked it as well that had to buy her one as well thanks for the amazing product
1,constant clicking sounds and static over the microphone this product is just terrible and is most likely due to the cheap mm design with no qc over it the sound quality is decent but the cheap plugs they use make it failure since you will end up with the annoying buzzing sound maybe you can get lucky and get headphone with the plugs properly fitted but chances are even little bump here or there will easily knock it off place good luck taking your chances with this product 
1,so the blue light won work unless you plug into additional usb power device kind of lame mean year old kid was sad as it showed them blue but guess my fault not reading more should just be battery would last forever being ledanyways it tried them on and they do block some noise the sound is pretty good he loves them would recommend as they are cheap and haven tried anything else 
1,i expected more but not bad
0,i use it for gaming have no problem with it 
1,love this mouse work excellent 
1,i bought it for my daughter and she loved it this mouse is very light well designed and easy to use light up is also very nice feature

0,i received it and it wasn bengoo product and it didn light up like described 
1,perfect
0,i use this product for my xbox am able to talk with my friends and hear the game 
1,would love it if it held charge or had backup space for battery have to constantly charge this usually every two days in the middle of my work day im over it going to go back to battery mouse 
1,this keyboard is great for gaming but when got this it came with downside is that my space bar was squeaky not too loud but definitely noticeable but later down the road with the keyboard it just recommendation to the product is at red light for the battery light so you can tell if it is low cause could be gaming and it does with no sort of warning but overall great product it works amazing
0,very disappointed in this product the item arrived obviously used and it did not work overall it was very negative experience would not recommend 
1,this is the second wireless mouse purchased both the same the first one works great have had it for while and love the look and feel the second one started sticking and locking up shortly after purchasing it hit or miss some days it fine other days want to throw it out the window 
1,i was looking for simple inexpensive wireless mouse to use on server that only have to access occasionally this fit the bill perfectly drivers installed automatically from windows and off to the races great price for simple solution 
0,do not buy the product does not work for intended purposes using as mouse for my computer it lights up and thats it can leave zero stars would if could 
0,i loved this speaker until it decided to not work it now turns on and immediately turns off it about year old and only handful of uses mostly used it in the garage fully charged battery but acts like it dead read it could be the battery installed new battery and that not it wouldn buy another one contacted jbl and they said that it was out of warranty and that since attempted to replace the battery it voided it which understand just stinks that it took premature crap out on me 
0,it is somehow ok
1,i like how it looks and you can hear well 
1,pros super great sound pretty noise cancelling great volume mic is decent for the price and filters out exterior sound pretty wellcons super tight on ears keep having to take them off to pop my ears even though my ears are tiny it works far better with my laptop alienware than my pc ibuypower but doubt that to the fault of the headphones 
0,love the sensitivity settingthe battery lasts long time between charges
1,loud and clear outdoors up to away but don expect lot of bass its there but not deep the speakers are on the ends and just aren large enough to move that much air however the sq is very good love that the battery lasts hours its light weight and easy to transport great addition to our camping trips 
0,battery life is so short it might as well be wired mouse it charges with as usb cable dropped once and had to be glued back together 
1,pretty good mouse for when do school work
0,despite there only being feet between my computer the usb adapter and this keyboard the unit disconnects constantly it okay for rts games but is literally unplayable with anything that requires constant use of the keyboard do not buy this keyboard 
0,wish you could have the option to not have the led color lights on all of the time or way to just pick one and not have the constant circulation looks bad during the day
1,i like this item lot very fairly priced and the low profile makes it easy on my hand don have the largest hands but not very small either and mouse with high hump is very uncomfortable this solves that problem nicely could do without the sleep mode am still getting used to waking it up and understand the value of sleep mode so deal with it never having to deal with batteries is also bonus charging it overnight is ideal but have already forgotten couple of nights and it fine if necessary you can plug it in and use it while it charges 
1, this is exactly what wanted cancels all noise in the background lights up and its my two favorite colors thanks amazon in love 
1,i have had the jbl charge for while the sound is good and what you would expect from portable waterproof battery powered bluetooth speaker anyone who expects studio quality sound from the aforementioned probably truly believes the president they voted for in is as great as he thinks he is however there is one flaw in the charge that no matter the sound quality or anything else will end the usefulness of this device the charging port for the charge is type and if you don get the cable in the port perfectly every time it becomes damaged to the point of being useless you are then left with pounds of useless junk jbl for this type of product how about more substantial charging port btw what will you give me for lbs of junk 
0,very pleased 
1,love this it feels like an extension of my hand 
1,it cheap my right click requires more force than my left the leds aren that vibrant not ergonomic it decent mouse but wouldn recommend it for gaming

0,bought this to use for noise cancelation at my office
1,it really nice bright soft key sound works while charging super happy

0,red lights stays on and nothing happens really like this mouse until this happened 
1,this keyboard is great it works exactly as advertised the keys are quiet the design is very fluid and the lights are cool charged it once when it came out of the box and have used it for hours doing work and playing games still haven had to recharge great product definitely worth the money

0,made very cheap broke the second it was too late to return it guess got what paid for save your money and buy better quality mouse 
1,best mouse ve ever bought 
1,it was great to begin with for the price wasn expecting lot however the scroll wheel quit working within the first times of using it which is one of the reasons purchased it to begin with 
1,the cool features for gaming notwithstanding multi colored back light keys that can breathe or rotate this is an excellent all around multi function keyboard for general pc workload including function buttons that allow dimming brightness volume control etc keys are responsive and charge lasts about hours of gaming depending on usage and how bright the settings of the back lighting for the keys are set plus the customer service at klim is top notch highly recommended you will not be disappointed 
1,this headset has very good sound quality fits nicely on head and comfortable the mic pickup isn too sensitive and of course it looks cool how it lights up 
0,i bought one and it broke st week the second one doesn work properly
1,these are fantastic the sound quality is amazing better than our multi thousand dollar home system of decades old high end speakers for those few who complain that the speaker is mono say of course how much stereo separation would you expect out of an inch system we re getting two more one for stereo separation in the great room the other to bring great sound to the master bath area 
1,got these for my son for christmas and they worked great now it march and they aren working at all 
1,i really like this item it is lot better than the other ones was using great for gaming charges quickly and easy to get started with and it fits my small hand perfectly would definitely recommend this product 
0,not at all impressed with the sound quality for the price expected much better update after months of use downgrading to star for mediocre sound quality and no bass is completely unacceptable no chance buying jbl again 
1,great sound and bass
0,for one this mouse is not compatible with the adapter and not worth the price by giving false information about the device update it and see why the adapter isn working or remove this item 
0,i glad after all the different choices of keyboards and all the different features believe choose the right one for me 
0,do not buy this mouse it stopped working in weeks 
1,it sleek and comfortable and the battery lasts forever once charged it great and it fits anywhere 
0,exactly what was looking for but get longer micro usb to usb charging cable the one it comes with is only about inches long just long enough to charge off your laptop 
0,i use this mouse all day every day at my desk job and have had to charge maybe once week it never dies on me just take it upon myself keep it on the regular mouse mode as don need all of the colors flashing but have no complaints
1,i ve had this for year just took it to the beach for second time got it wet got sand on it works perfectly it can bump as well but the mids aren super clear if you care about that my guess is most of you dont but do so took off star all together this is star device and if you want to annoy your roommate or put it in backpack and ride downtown with the volume all the way up you totally can and your phone will probably die first unless you rode the bike would purchase again

0,this thing became erratic after about month ve tried all the fixes found online and nothing works 
1,very nice keyboard lots of color choices breathing speed can be adjusted from really slow to fast or you can choose to not breathe at all and keep solid color well made my only complaint is it shuts off after seconds of non use but simple touch of button immediately turns it back on again contacted customer service for some questions regarding the lighting nothing was wrong with the keyboard customer service was fantastic they responded to me immediately and answered all my questions would definitely recommend this keyboard 
0,really bad and not worth it
1,love it great value
0,i purchased this in july and it worked perfectly it now ass backwards you have to hold the button down just in order to move the cursor if let go of the button it does nothing its completely off track the led only works when it charging before it worked whenever it was on the last switch on the bottom of the mouse

1,love it so far got it was basically fully charged and played all day at the pool barely saw any decrease in power love the sound and the good bass able to control sound eq via the settings on my phone for those recognizing it doesn seem to have an eq in an app or something we are stepping up from the jbl clip which is also really great just doesn have the volume we wanted for patio or at the pool fills locker room full of sound easy too able to listen at low volume and still have full depth of sound many commented about the mono sound aspect but honestly love this sound it full and the highs mids are pronounced with clarity no distortion my only nit is that it definitely will muffle if like towel is over it or something not really worth knocking my rating tho had it in my sport bag and could notice decrease in clarity solid purchase very happy with it

0,a 
0,this mouse was disappointing it would work for while and then it would lose connection and stop working thought at first it was losing traction and wasn sensing movement so bought an entirely new mousepad did the same thing after few minutes of use it would lose connection 
1,this headset is very affordable and has great quality sound 
1,the back light is very nice some of the top keys don have the clearest numbering lettering but if you know where the keys are this is very minor wish the back light had an adjustable sleep timer one charge lasts long time and you can still use the keyboard while it plugged in for charging the charging cable isn very long but can easily be combined with usb extension cord the ergonomic design and curved keys offer comfort during many hours of use

1,the main we reason we bought the jbl to begin with was because it has the jack that you could use for an ipod know old school my husband had spent years downloading all of his favorite songs on his ipod and wanted to be able to listen to his playlist through quality speaker once we received the speaker we were super impressed with the sound quality the bluetooth range is good too we liked the quality so much that we have three of them we keep one at home for pool parties and get togethers and we have two at our cabin 
0,first hours of having it couldn get it to charge and isnt usable while on the charging cord completely useless do not buy this cheap junk if there was zero stars button it would be ticked 
1,good for gaming my husband likes them cancelled the noise good plus the light looks great in the dark will be buying more for our kids 
1,my sons love these gaming headphones the sound quality is great and they look really cool too 
0,charged this for hrs like instructed and could not get the mouse to work extremely disappointed and returning 
1,good mouse holds good charge perfect for gaming 
1,i bought this for my daughter and she loves it the colors are great which is what she loves most it also very lightweight simple to use and reasonably priced like that you can charge it instead of having to change batteries the most important thing for me is durability she is child and is still kind of rough with her electronics but so far it is holding up 
1,this mouse is perfect companion for my microsoft surfacepro use this mouse for casual browsing as well as digital artwork and photo editing the mouse feels nice and works well especially for the price also love the option to have the rgb color mode on or off during use perfect little mouse for everyday use

1,i made sure that this product was gonna be good one and was not disapointed it silent click which is nice the lights look awesome on it it was just worth it 
0,never buy this product when buy something usually look at product reviews but this product seems to have lot of problems unlike reviews don usually post reviews but posting this product review in hopes that there won be victims like me bought mouse and it worked fine at first but after charging it it started to get weird and didn work at all so thought there might be small problem so exchanged the new one instead of refund received new mouse and it worked fine for another few days but after charging it again it didn work the product user manual says it is sensitive to charging but this is serious problem bought this product for the convenience of not using the battery or wire but think it makes no sense to not work because of the charging prolem 
0,don like
0,quit working already
1,i really liked this mouse when first got it it was low profile had nice soft and quiet click had rainbow lights and was available in rose gold color thought made great purchase now ve had it for less than months and the scroll wheel is so squeaky can stand to hear it when scrolling through documents bummed it was lemon 
1,this mouse was purchased for year old girl she loves the colors the fit and the fact that it works without making noise 
0,they stopped working after week
1,it works fine but honestly would suggest better quality one it fits weirdly around the head but the sound quality is fine you get what you pay for basically
1,my son loves it he loves the way it lights up win win for mommy 
0,close by lacking quick response while using it it works but something gf elt off 
0,felt cheap returned for better product
1,overall this is very well priced keyboard and perfect for someone on budget my only issues was that the key press took abit of getting used to and the travel was tad too shallow for my personal liking function and feature wise no complaints at all 
0,would recommend and would buy again 
1,it is amazing buying the boombox
1,this is the second time bought this headset and it has short in the cord won buy it again 
0,once fully discharged couldn get it to work again even after charging for multiple hours multiple times
1,love the color love how it changes colors and love how it holds charge 
1,like this mouse work good
0,battery life is so short it might as well be wired mouse it charges with as usb cable dropped once and had to be glued back together 
1,the headset is comfortable and has good sound quality wish the mic was longer but thats really it 
0,like the mouse but having to recharge it with usb all the time is annoying and unproductive 
0,advertisement says three backlit effects and it is not true overall not bad keyboard but marketing is fraud 
0,there were no instructions with the mouse 
1,this headset has excellent quality for being such reasonable price it has really long cord which is nice if you get up so you don yank on cords use it to play rainbow six siege and it helps me win 
1,i ve had these for about years now and they still feel and sound great good choice for standard cheap headset or general pc usepros plastic is light and flexible good for long play sessions cord is strong even after few mishaps with my chair wheel good sound quality not an expert in sound mixing but know what bad headphones sound like rarely use the mic but it functional and the mute switch still holds solidcons cord may be strong but it prone to bending in weird ways it may just be how rapped my cord around the back of my neck but it caused part of it to form rigid curve the volume control is little loose and will sometimes rise or lower if brushed against noise cancelling is effective but not perfect about what you expect though depending on what you want this could be positive led is barely feature it either takes up usb port or the plug dangles from the back of your pc or the bottom of your controller
1,update definitely noticeable sound differences between the speakers the model is flatter and doesn get as loud as the model it also has muffled sound to it so far have received bad customer service from jbl the seller bought from electronics expo an authorized dealer has week return policy so outside of that and thus far jbl won even admit they are selling different models to customers sent pictures and even links to fcc filing pages and the customer service reps don even acknowledge it they want me to do factory resets and firmware updates it different hardware all they offered me was some coupon and told me to deal with the seller this is the last time ll ever purchase jbl product and surely will urge friends and family to steer clear of them as well original pictures included just so people are aware there are different models of the actual speaker you may get with this it seems legitimate based on the fcc filings page but want people to understand in case they notice differences like did when put them side by side the model number on the box itself is the same jblchargeblkam but jbl is shipping different speakers inside the box and not telling people there is model and model the boxes themselves are nearly identical besides the small qr code next to the serial number on the model if you open the charging port flap and look on the left side next to the serial number you will see which one you have now if you only order one speaker you probably never know but if you order of them and receive different models the differences are obvious charges the looks to be the older model according to fcc filings this has mah battery inside from my personal observations the mesh on the outside is thicker and you cannot see through it at all it also feels bit heavier in the hand don have digital scale to measure exactly but it definitely more dense the charging indicator lights are also much brighter you can see this in the pictures chargej the seems to be the newer model this is the model that actually has mah battery inside the mesh is not as thick on this model and you can easily see the speaker components inside also the charging lights on this model are much dimmer compared to the it feels bit lighter in the hand as well haven put them through the ringer yet to see if there are audio differences it would be very disappointing if there are so buyer beware jbl is selling different speakers with different battery sizes that potentially sound different but they are marketing it as the same product wish would have known this before bought them 
0,this product has very low quality sound it sounds weak the microphone has to be turned up and is very low quality it sounds like cb radio 
0, liked the product while it lasted the few months it did it just stopped working out the blue 
0,stopped working after months

0,these stop working after short while bought they all have been returned spend couple bucks more and buy different unit
1,great headset microphone last about three months before it broke searching for good headset and this wasn it great sound excellent noise cancellation these gaming headsets take beating as none of them have ever lasted year play battle total and fps so communication is needed

1,incredible speaker am having some bluetooth problems not sure if it my phone or the speaker itself but it amazing you won be unsatisfied 
1,love the pretty lights just wish that the charge would last longer still even with pretty long hours of gaming and accidentally leaving it on the battery lasts solid hours would recommend good for the price that for sure
0,bought this one thinking it was the bigger one before the boombox turned out to be the next one after the flip had flip before this charge sounds just like it it basically flip with extra battery life if your looking for bigger sound go with the extreme or boombox 
0,the key labels are wearing off after months 
0,mouse was working fine for about week now the middle button to scroll stop working
1,i was pretty happy with this keyboard bit louder than wanted but good just couple weeks ago maybe months after purchase the keyboard cannot send typing commands to any computers it can turn on light up etc have tired multiple cables direct connection or rf usb connection etc nothing works would suggest spending your money elsewhere 
1,used it for ps works great
1,perfect in my office love the lightweight and easy to use 
0,product sound quality diminished months after purchase purchased march sound is now inaudible 
1,solid bluetooth speaker connects quick charges your phone quick and good sound quality pretty loud 
1,my favorite bluetooth speaker ve owned sound quality is amazing especially given its size 
0,works as advertised and looks great little bulky for my tastes but it does its job note as others mentioned the wording on the headset itself is different than in the picture displayed but it is the same model would star it if it was little more comfy for long hours of use but after an hour or two because of its weight and bulk it really starts to become uncomfortable for me 
0,a gift for my grandson
1,excellent purchase bought as gift for my son bday and loved it sounds great bluetooth easy definite star purchase
0,hp laptop compat
0,good
1,very light weight and low for click sounds long battery life easy to pair nice feeling of touch with my hand love to use this mouse for my wot game on my laptop 
0,out of the package my initial thoughts were that the product seemed very cheaply made and those thoughts were confirmed when after one month of use the product stopped working would not recommend this product 
0,this is fine speaker but none of your usb chargers will work with it that brings the score down to for me it pretty useless 
0,i bought different one of these in the fall and it worked for short time thought was buying from different company this time but this mouse also has failed me do not buy this mouse charged it and still nothing 
1,love ya
0,sleek and easy to use and fast charging
1,great
0,sounds quality was fine but stopped working within months kept the cord straight and didn bend it much but it losing connection
0,i bought this mouse in february it uit working and you relpaced it now the new one quit 
0,i made the mistake of reading the reviews only after bought the mouse because it had stars with something like reviews so thought it was fine saw few reviews that said the seller tried to bribe them into removing their review that made me really regret buying from such an unethical business don think you should buy this mouse even if you re on budget there much better quality mice out there for even less money than this costs this mouse is very cheaply made as for performance issues for one it way too thin and lightweight when using it it very easy to knock it out of place and click something by mistake because it not heavy enough or grippy enough on the bottom to stay where you put it ve never had this issue with mouse before the tracking sensor is also way too sensitive the cursor still moves when you lift the mouse decent couple centimeters above the surface it on this also makes it very hard to put the cursor where you want it on the screen because it still tracking movement when you lift it up the cord to charge it is pretty short although that not huge issue just sort of disappointing the biggest issue is that the cord does not seem to fit properly into the port on the mouse and takes bit of manhandling it felt like was going to break some of the cheap thin plastic when first plugged it in as for looks the edges where the paint or whatever it is on the top are pretty rough and it even came with some of the paint chipped off bought the light pink mouse it not nearly as light as it is in the pictures it darker and much warmer toned rather than cool light pink like the picture it also not as reflective as the pictures show but that not huge deal you can turn off the rgb lights by the switch on the bottom if you want but it still emits red light when using it wish it didn do that it ugly and probably wastes more power 
1,i like the way it handles while moving it think it is little small for big hand it is cute and colorful have not played any games with it yet but am sure it will be quick and smooth 
0,cheap af audio is the worst ve had garbage all around
0,it doesn work
0,really good
0,it was nice while it lasted unfortunately for me that was less than three months 
1,it all fun and cute at the beginning but after month in half past my refund window and it has stopped working tried charging it nothing extremely disappointed 
0,it very cheap headset if you re just looking for something that ll just get the job done this works it not bad or terrible just cheap although after wearing the headset for while my ears started to hurt but that might ve been personal issue
1,i ve had it for about day now and it already been big use in my life ve so far used them to play games with my close friends and it great we can here each other clearly it also good for recording audio for things like animations and twitch streams these great pair of headphones and recommend them 
1,the battery doesn even last one day pretty much have to keep it plugged in at all times and have the light setting turned off it looks like nice mouse and the wheel and clicking is fine but what the point if it never charged don waste your money on this mouse 
0,purchased for my son for gift only used for month and they no longer work past the return policy 
0,it very good
1,my husband and now have jbl speakers and love them we have huge home and our business on the property too so we use them every where and any where we are easy to connect great sound quality and wide blue tooth connection we can connect to our computer lap top tablet phone tv and even in our car they have great color selection too highly recommend this product 
0,not cheap speaker and used it for less then months and it just stops battery is full and it was waste of maney
0,i have held back writing review on this mouse based on some of the comments that it would die on them or it became unreliable after while it has not been the case for me have had it for several months now and it is very reliable and maintains all of its functions intact would recommend the mouse 
1,great buy 
0,the cushion material is very uncomfortable after few minutes of wear it feels like your ears get hot quickly it seems it would have been easy to cover foam ear piece with more breathable material sound quality is great and the microphone seems to be perfect but sound quality means absolutely nothing if it is too uncomfortable to wear 
1,needed keyboard that was backlit but did not want just plain white use this for my desktop computer since am now working from home so can speak for gamers but for my job it been great the colors really pop and you can adjust the brightness or just turn off the color all together very happy with my purchase 
0,the scroll wheel stopped working after weeks 
1,the connectivity is great and the sound is the bomb 
1,got these for the kids chromebook best thing yet kids like the lights and they are easy for them to use 
1,i bought this product months ago the wireless had good range you can use it while charging color led looks good during night time simple and handy fast charging on off buttons worth for money 
1,i use these for gaming music videos schoolwork pretty much everything spanning both pc and console experiences they work great and still work great after almost year of ownership the chord is tad unwieldy with its length and the headphones aren ideal for noise canceling other than that can find any issues 
0,this is exactly what needed my favorite features are the quite clicks and the led lights 
1,my son loves his keyboard customer service through klm is available and very thorough and helpful if needed 
1,love the response time on the keys and how quiet it is

1,i have had this mouse for two weeks for the first few days it worked great nothing has changed with my work setup fresh batteries clean underside with mouse pad and it continues to lag disappointed in the product 
0,it is not sound the way expectedand it came whitout the charger
0,use for work in an aqua aerobics class environment works quite well
0,if you had that ve never ending need to have wireless mouse that has led colors on it that needs to be constantly plugged in for it to work then this is for you the charge on it will last approximately hours before it dead if you turn off the pretty lights then maybe it will last hours really not functional wireless mouse don buy it 
1,love it love the sound quality bass is amazing lasts all day bring it all around the house with me and the bluetooth connection reaches very far further than any other speaker ve had tbh absolutely worth the 
1,great product for the money 
1,i pruchased this because since working from home have become so tired of all the wires from mouse not only is this great price but plugged it in charged it from the box and it started working perfectly it is smaller than my older mouse but like it it is silent and feels nice in my hand 
0,the sound of these speakers are mediocre to poor the bluetooth connection continually misfires and sound dissolves into static was surprised that this kind of speaker gets good marks 
1,this is the best mouse that ve used in long time no batteries needed just charge it when needed ve used this for little over day and it doing great 
0,i like it
1,i ve taken this thing on the go for few months now and it great speaker purchased it to replace my stolen charge the quality is very good for most genres and the bass is something to appreciate the battery life is outstanding sometimes forget to turn it off disabled the power sounds for it and it easier to forget now and it will last days of just being on it very portable as long as you have decent sized bag to carry it in used my backpack very good purchase 
0,quit working already
0,small solid compact durable high quality speaker with big sound and long lasting rechargeable batteries 
1,all can say is really good for the price would recommended 
1,the type extension doesn work so it rendered it useless for my mac am able to use it on my pc for work just not the intended use bought it for the mouse itself is great light easy to use fits perfectly in my hand always connects and is reliable 
1,wasn expecting much because it seemed low priced but have been using daily for work for about month now and it wonderful no issues actually bought two of them one grey and one gold and they both work fine 
0,just arrived and my son was so excited we plug it into the sony ps controller not off brand and nobody can hear him chat in fortnight my husband plugged it into his phone and the microphone worked why not the ps that what we bought it for so it basically useless for our needs 
1,so far very pleased with this product it connected with my laptop automatically with no problems the slim line design slips into my laptop case outer pocket very nicely and there seems to be no issues with charging it from computer port 
1,overall very happy with the headset the microphone never worked but the rest of the headset worked so well that the person we gifted it to used it anyway worked great for cancelling the noise in small crowded house 
1,good for kids gaming experience with good price
1,love everything about it 
1,i realized was spending more money on cheaper less effective speakers finally invested in jbl honestly don regret the cost its by far the best speaker ve ever owned bike lot and love to use hammocks at the beach always have it hanging on strap you can hear it from long distance in loud environment do it purchase it 
1,super speaker sound is great easy blue tooth setup great value
1,bought this mouse for work because didn want to use the corded mouse my company gave me not even two months in the mouse scroller breaks never dropped the mouse never did anything but charge it twice week and use it for work had to overnight ship completely different mouse for work the next day very disappointed because really liked the mouse and had even told my coworkers to buy this glad they didn waste their money like did 
0,the mouse worked fine at first then the battery stopped holding charge for long time after month it stopped working completely 
0,i ordered this product but the cursor kept jumping around the screen even when it was fully charged figured just got bad apple so made an exchange for new one the new mouse came scratched not big deal and the scroll wheel wasn as smooth annoying but its fine but this one cursor is jumping around the screen too would have otherwise liked the mouse it charges up quickly and appreciate the sleep mode so that that battery life lasts longer 
0,amazon increasingly started to provide no name no sn no model description poor quality merchandise which fail to operate out of the box they may or may not function 
0,i loved this mouse for the literal two weeks days that had it and it was working for no apparent reason the scroll wheel just suddenly stopped working approximately five seconds after had last used it had not subjected it to any pressure or abuse of any sort was looking at document scrolled down continued reading tried to scroll down and nope in the lower ratings this seems to be common problem bummed really did love the mouse 
1,i ve had this unit for several years the sound is fine as some have described the sound is definitely on the warm end of the spectrum and the highs are bit lacking but the performance is better than expected at this price point anyway no one should expect super high fidelity from low cost portable speaker we use ours to stream music when we are by the pool or in the hot tub and to listen to audiobooks around the house it is great for these applications the battery lasts long time we often go week or more without needing charge the usb connection is handy now that more and more devices are using this standard the bluetooth connectivity is outstanding it connects seamlessly and reliably and seems to have quite good range far less finicky and fussy than other bluetooth devices we use the unit is durable although advertised as water resistant and absolutely not spec for this my unit fell into the hot tub and floated there for two days was wondering where it went looked all over the house my spouse suggested checking the hot tub sure enough there it was expected it to be dead nope it fine do not recommend immersing the unit in water am sure we got lucky nevertheless we were impressed 
1,great sound definitely recommend and for the price forget about it
0,not bad would rather have purchased apple
1,this keyboard is great you want wireless keyboard ranging from gaming to office work this is the one for you the only downside can think of is it not bluetooth but other than that ita fantastic now stop thinking about getting it and just get it 
1,love these got them on lightening deal don use them for gaming use them for my laptop zooms and love em don hurt my ears and great quality sound on both ends
0,bought these headphones for my son to use with his ps he can hear others just fine but the mic doesn work very disappointing just arrived and took it out of the box today 
0,this mouse is very cheaply made and did not function properly right out of the box it will move the cursor around and scroll but it will not click on anything right or left click ridiculous want to return it but the hassle of dealing with it isn worth getting the money back since it was so cheap to begin with should have known to go for more expensive and reputable brand like logitech 
0,after month and half of buying this wireless mouse the piece where you charge it is broken have been extremely careful with it and never dropped it loved it but poor quality don buy it 
0,feels very cheap and performs cheap too both sides stick together when wanting to use just the left side button but they both go down and pop wen going back up difficult to click on just single item 
1,rgb is good with on off and breathing very small and light keys are close together and not too loud main thing is it doesn hold charge for long if you game lot this keyboard only lasts not even days no warning just shuts off at the perfect time 
0,i thought this mouse was gonna work really good and last long time based on the reviews unfortunately the charger that came with the mouse isn charging the mouse tried everything to get it to work and would not the mouse worked for few hours before dying on me not good purchase and not satisfied with their product 
1,this gaming headset is really good for the price and it super comfortable the audio quality was better than expected overall if you re looking for good priced headset this is good choice 
1,excellent mouse very smooth 
0,this mouse stops working even when fully charged and the light on the bottom is on this did not start happening until weeks after the return window ended would not recommend buying this for these reasons it was waste of money 
0,product was great the only thing jbl could of did was add the power brick and not just the usb cable also ppl to turn on the lower bass setting hold and bluetooth button for secs until the circle around the buttons light up wy 
0,it great looking keyboard but when you are typing random keys just start repppppppppppppppeating ve tried making corrections in my computer setting window but nothing works tossed the original box it came with so stuck with it now but beware this product 
0,i bought this about months ago and it worked perfect in the course of normal use turned it off and then went to plug it in immediately after noticed the unit wouldnt charge and proceeded to try several other chargers to no avail since product is slightly more than year old jbl is offering to give me the names of local repair shops that can pay out of pocket to fix this shoddy workmanship for premium product that is more than likely designed to break after warranty so you ll have to buy another just dont get how it can work and after turning if off while working it would proceed to never turn on again if you want to throw away every year then this is the perfect speaker for you was offered discount on future speaker but that is not the answer wanted or expected 
1,fun and great to use 
1,great quality and non expensive 
1,i have been wanting speaker for while this one was on sale on amazon so got it love the color the battery lasts forever great sound took it tubing and it got little wet but it does claim to be water resistant and it continues to work just fine 
1,i originally ordered the white version but when got it realized it was see through asked the shop owner whether this was just an issue with the version ordered or what all the white mouses look like they re all white according to the shop because raised concern they were so kind to ship different color to me free of charge didn even have to return the original 
0,it worked the two minutes it stayed charged left it charging for an hour and used it total of two minutes before it completely died again left it charging hours and it did the same thing waste of money 
1,i gave gaming star because don do gaming the mouse is worth every penny love how it feels love that it makes no noise you must use mouse pad 
1,larger than had expected but fine redder too very impressive sound from jbl again good features but you need to ensure the cover of the ports is tight can see leak paths very happy with it and the price paid great value 
1,easy to pair and stays charged for hours bought it for gardening the back deck and beach trips some other reviewers are disappointed in sound quality but for the price it really great deal have no complaints about the sound wasn expecting sound for listen to wide variety of genres and can fault this speaker 
1,love how it looks when it changes colors comes with adapter charging cord and live the fact that it is rechargeable and the price was amazing
0,this was the worst mouse ve bought it goes dead very fast and then you have to charge it all night for it to die fast again would not recommend this mouse 
1,must be connected to console to light up but other than that great for the price volume was tricky to find but it does adjust 
1,meets my needs and really enjoy it goes into sleep mode when not in use 
1,bought here for my son he loves them lights and mic work great
0,remember to recharge it something neglected to do because am an idiot 
0,works ok with just the standard usb dongle but we purchased to use with mac that only has usb and it doesn work with the adapter contacted the company through email but they never responded 
1,it says so in the info but if you re like me you go right to reviews lol have tested it with my ps fits great over my glasses ll update once use it more updatei forgot to update this before but these headphones works fine lights included they are comfortable and work with my android phone as well 
1,this came on time exactly as described it is quieter when you click the buttons than regular mouse it easy to charge and works well it wireless which is great it works perfectly with my sons laptop and the games he plays on it have no complaints would recommend to anyone 
0,don order it it does not function well at all 
1,i love this mouse not only is silent mouse but it is light and also changes colors on the side so far have received compliments from my coworkers they said it fancy mouse 
0,it nice laptop but won say it for hardcore gamers the backlight stays rainbow colored and will turn on after few seconds of non use which makes it difficult to use it in the dark have to hit the spacebar just to turn the lights back on and that annoying the wireless feature is nice and ve had no real issues other than the light problem 
0,love th wmouse but my wheel to scroll broke so be careful
1,wow what great keyboard that makes typing fun keys are well spaced if you use shortcuts frequently this will really help does not feel cheap at all the construction is top notch and the key sound is an elegant clicky pump sound as far as can tell rgb color pattern is the only color choice but many ways to tune the back lighting effect to your taste super happy with the purchase 
1,speaker sounds good connects quick and battery lasts long time seems durable and well built
0,it works fine just seems little cheap and not real comfortable 
1,sounds great
1,i like this mouse the light colors constantly scroll through rainbow and aren static on just one color my office is in my bedroom and if leave the mouse on it makes great nightlight not too bright but just light enough to find my way around if wake up during the night especially love the fact that it rechargeable and that haven had to put any batteries in it since bought it several months ago the thing don like is that it has tendency to do its own thing sometimes if working on the couch and put the mouse down next to me flat and completely still not rolling backwards or moving at all the cursor on the screen will sometimes take off at diagonal stuttering its way up and across the screen at other times will be using the mouse to click and drag something or draw line and the cursor will suddenly jump to completely different part of the screen or it will hiccup and lose the hold on what was clicking and dragging or cause the line to wobble sometimes quite sharply kind of like trying to draw straight line in the car when the tire hits pothole it good little mouse and aside from the spastic glitches pleased with it but am getting tired of not having full control right when need it most may keep this one for its nightlight capabilities and shop for another rechargeable mouse to use with my computer 
0,nice and soft but the laser isn very accurate
0,this is the worst mouse every charged it over night with the usb still in my computer and then when got up to use it in the morning it wasn turning on 
0,for one this mouse is not compatible with the adapter and not worth the price by giving false information about the device update it and see why the adapter isn working or remove this item 
0,nice keyboard with few quirks 
0,did not like the sound quality did not like the app that was suppose to improve the quality of sound
0,i got this mouse for work it works great however it needs to be charged and unfortunately it can be used with battery it only usb charger so the only down side of this if work with it for days will need to charge it or it will die on and have to keep charging it in ur laptop to keep using it it unfortunately not for me and don like how it doesn have battery or dies fast 
0,mine is not working after month of use
1,perfect for starting out in gaming
1,i wanted silent mouse due to classes using proctorio with professor who was huge on thinking sounds could be cheating absolutely loved how silent it is when you press the buttons only thing haven got to work as well is the wireless aspect but it doesn bother me just plug it in for charging wise and use it as wired mouse love the changing lights as well works well for my laptop loved having light up gaming mouse for my desktop and now have something similar to use for my laptop that quiet 
0,liked illumation
1,i was amazed at how light it is and requires no batteries the functions of the keyboard are simple to use and having options for the lighting is awesome super comfy keyboard on the flip side thought you could change the color settings but that no it not silent more than the character keys are quiet but the spacebar is normal clicking sound and connecting it to phone charger is preferred to plugging it into your pc to charge the pc might get bit confused great product guys and love the schwag 
0,it work good but not great
1,well for starters you can beat the price of true wireless computer keyboard like most of the other reviews didn care for the battery life so after losing power one night and the battery had died in the keyboard looked over to my power bank and said to myself why not not only does it work can sit on the couch about feet or so from the tv and don need to worry about the keyboard battery life nor having super long charging cable knocks on wood so far the keyboard has been holding up and can say that it has paid for its self the only issue have with it is the enter button like to make emoji faces and every time go to make one always do instead other then that great budget friendly keyboard 
0,yesterday the microphone was working fine today the microphone sounds like miles away nothing changed on my computer the headset is just piece of crap 
1,needed temporary set of headphones and they do not work with my ps controller don care about the lights which need to be connected via usb but the audio does not work with my ps works perfectly fine on my laptop but not on my ps which is extremely annoying 
0,the scroll button stopped working after months bought it in july and now only november it doesn work anymore it very unfortunate this happened would expect this will last the shape is good it easy to use and to connect but the item received unfortunately didn last will try to contact the seller and see what they say 
0,this mouse came broken very upset it was delivered in time but the devise itself was broken the package was opened it wasn even inside the actual box it ridiculous definitely going to get my money back gave it star because had no choice but too 
0,worked for minutes the first time turned on the mouse and then it just completely stopped working with my macbook charged it for days and still does not work 
1,this keyboard is really light wait quality is top notch you can type for hours without getting tired good gaming keyboard as well good company with good quality products highly recommended klim products 
0,laptop slipped of my lap and obviously landed on thw protuding hardware troubling as have much to do ive not acustomed to the finger pad 
0,horrible just horrible
0,the microphone stopped working after owning the headphones less than week 
1,super comfortable on ears great for long time use 
1,this is great bluetooth speaker love jbl and this little speaker did not disappoint 
1,not made for ps first off you need to plug in the usb connection into separate power source to get the lights to work the sound jack that plugs in to your ps controller is split with the usb but both cords are very short so you have to choose to play with the lights off if you want to use it with the ps controller comfortably if thats the case then whats the point of owning it this is made more for laptops than ps dont recommend if you are thinking of buying it for the ps 
0,started out great but after about weeks and when the return window closed will not hold charge it charging when the blue light is on only stays on for second after plugging in if there were stars would give it that didn even have enough time to really use it only got about uses before it wouldn charge 
1,has worked great until now charged it and now it won turn back on can return it either not worth the money

0,tried to take this to and from work and the wheel in the center is no longer functional
0,good
1,great sound quality headphones for gaming can hear everything in the game super clear noise cancelation from outside noised would definitely recommend these headphones 
1,there really nothing to dislike about it love the fact that don have to run out and buy batteries every time it starts to act like it not going to work the way it charges is one of the main reasons that bought it rather save the for batteries and get something else instead of worrying if have enough spare batteries have mouse pad that has breathing mode and the mouse goes along with its own pattern to make the two of them an excellent night light of sorts for the amount spent give this mouse also love the fact that it easy to pack it up with my laptop and go anywhere without worrying again if my mouse will run out of power think that there should be more accessories that can charge from usb port rather than lugging around extra batteries 
1,my child uses this for gaming he very happy with it he picky about headsets and this one seems to work well enough for him without any complaints he able to chat with others while gaming and sound quality is good for him easy to use and no setup required for gaming on pc 
0,this is really nice mouse like it and it works well the only thing is you charge it with mini usb charger and it takes long time not sure if not charging it all the way but it has short battery life 
1,the mouse is aesthetically very cute and does feel nice on the hand main issue is for both gaming and other computer activities the mouse will randomly jump across the screen which has never happened with any other mouse it led to misclicks ve deleted emails didn mean to because of it essentially just unreliable 
1,nice headset blue lights are cool addition the headset is comfortable and works great well worth the price 
0,i like the fact can see the keys at night hate the fact that two out of four receiver stopped working still love the two that working 
0,easy to use
0,i had to get another mouse this wouldn respond to clicks or scrolling about of the time even when got the mousepad that improves mouse functioning 
1,one of the greatest products have ever purchased 
1,sound stunning and great bass for it size compact speaker
0,i have already ordered the black one and liked it so much orderer another one for my laptop 
1,the mouse is contained in japanese package but was made in china it comes with the type adapter charging usb cable regular usb mouse receiver and thin instructions ve plugged the type adapter into two different machines with the same result neither laptops read the type directly or through another adapter ve also tried another wireless mouse receiver in the type with the same results none of them work through this adapter other than that issue the mouse works it also goes to sleep so by clicking the mouse one is able to use it again the also other nice feature is that it is wireless with no battery included just plug in the charging cord into an empty usb slot the color changing around the rim of the mouse gives nice touch and although at first the mouse feels long due to it sleek shape it does fit comfortably in the hand it also has plastic like feeling and on the instructions it says to avoid dropping the mouse so it doesn malfunction or break 
0,this mouse stopped working after less than months would not recommend
1,i was pleased to see just how well made the mouse was when received it couldn have asked for more for the money it comfortable in my hand the rubber texture really makes using it pleasure the dongle storage on the bottom of the mouse isn covered but it nice and tight so not worried about losing it so far so good 
1,really good headset for the price fits well and isn uncomfortable definitely something would purchase again it also has nice sleek look to it 
0,awful first thing opened the box the headphones looked beautiful and was so excited to try them out tried connecting them to my computer with one wire didn work tried another didn work finally worked with the extender thing called my friend to play valorant after he said the mic quality was awful and it is the sound is also terrible can only hear through one side or the other at time and they re extremely uncomfortable can barely adjust them mic is very far from face they would also disconnect constantly and when they did had to set them back up they also crashed my game every time they disconnected do not buy not worth it 
0,you won hear the annoying clicking sound from this mouse 
1,sound is clear and definitely cuts down the noise of my youngens running around lol exactly as described 
1,pretty good quality for the price was very surprised they re not as good as turtle beaches but there are half the price and pretty close
0,works well and charges very quickly
1,i absolutely love this mouse first off have to say my cat has knocked this done off the table multiple times and it still works that is huge with me next it very nice mouse love the colors it lights up with its so nice to not have to worry about battery too just plug in and charge and ready to go swear charge it like once month too and it still works great highly recommend this mouse 
0,incredibly inconsistent keyboard regularly misses strokes and does not work with basic windows shortcuts anything requiring press of left ctrl and shift does not work dont waste your money
1,i really like this mouse love that it doesn need batteries you just charge it and it ready to go did have issue with my macbook pro when connecting the adapter for the receiver it comes with to my computer it changed my scrolling ability on my laptop trackpad and wasn able to scroll without using the mouse had to call apple to figure out how to fix it and that when discovered removing the usb adapter the mouse comes with from my computer solved the problem have usb to usb adapter from the mac store so just used that for the mouse receiver and it worked perfectly and it doesn change my scrolling ability with the trackpad at all 
0,wanted to match my keyboard and not spend too much money this little number is priced just right and the size and shape make it easy to use 
1,cute and fun to watch while using
1,i honestly liked everything overall sitting in my room listening to music thought it was super loud and loved it then when went outside you could barely hear it from short distance 
1,very easy to set up and use love it
1,this is very good little system for the price holds charge for long time and sounds really good at reasonable volume
0,it keeps shaking 
0,this mouse was very useful and relatively enjoyable the first week and half at two weeks it seemed to glitch the cursor would jerk and freeze so connected the mouse to the charger it was ok for couple of days but sadly succumbed to its cheapness this afternoon very cheaply made product maybe those star reviews are bought very disappointing 
0,i like the sound but so sick of carrying two or three speakers around for days with of music doesn matter what model ue might not sound as good but the battery life is much better jbl just give me product that delivers not holding on your support lines for let try this charge flip it megaboom box go ve spent way too much money with you done 
0,piece of junk stopped working after day now the only way for the cursor to move is if you hold down the right mouse button how is that even possible did the mouse rewire itself not sure how this product is so highly rated 
0,smooth clicking ran out of battery quickly so shut it off when not in use 
0,this mouse is cute and comfortable to use but the only downfall is if it is sitting idle for few minutes it hard to get it working again sometimes have to turn it off then on
0,after two months of non regular use this mouse has already stopped working properly scroll wheel has completely stopped working on it own and now feels somewhat loose when touched was good while it worked and liked the color of it but only two months of use is unacceptable when there are other similar priced options from other companies 
1,i bought two of these to use with our laptops both computers recognized them right away and we were able to use them easily like the variety of colors offered and the lower profile so my hand doesn cramp like it has with some other styles the light up colors are fun think it was good value for the money 
1,the company is so kind and understanding really appreciated all their help with the product

1,works great
1,fast shipping great product as expected
0,this was good for couple weeks and then the reception became extremely poor would personally go for another keyboard in my opinion also amazon will not refund it bs if you ask me just go with wired keyboard 
1,i have been using this with my work laptop which use hours daily for remote work ve had this for few weeks and only needed to charge once since then really love the feel of it it near silent and very soft click sound when using buttons like the look of it and the lights so know when it in sleep mode turns on and immediately works with one click completely operational when plugged in to charge as well the charge cord is very short but plugged into the laptop to charge it and it was long enough for me to use it right next to the usb port it was plugged into without being nuisance would love for there to be way to see the battery life on the mouse it the only thing would change add very pleased and hope it lasts long while update this mouse is still going strong still love it use it daily for work day days week still love the lights lol my one and only complaint wish we could see the battery life of the mouse have been charging one every couple of weeks just to be safe hate the laptop mouse it does work when plugged in and charging tho so that is nice just prefer wireless im not knocking off stars due to this at all just offering suggestion to somehow let us see the battery life remaining

0,i had intended on buying megaboom but got to test out this speaker along with boom and megaboom and the fullness of sound in particular the quality of the bass on this thing blew those two out of the water the non universal charge cord is little annoying but oh well don expect to get sub bass out of this thing it would have to be about inches taller for that

1,m daughter loves it 
0,like it
1,i just recently bought two of them to be able to sync both speakers up together and it just makes the atmosphere of where you are just that much better we just recently went out to the river and it was great to have them both connected since we could have one in the water and one with everyone else who was sitting down the range on these are pretty decent as well and the battery can easily last all day but only if its not to max volume great speakers though and highly recommend 
1,hi have purchased this product for my daughter so happy with the overall looks and performance will recommend you to buy great buy 
1,this was such great buy way better than my microsoft mouse soooo happy bought this the light features are really nifty haven really touched it but just so impressed with now smooth it works on surfaces and on the computer in love
0,now correct me if wrong but keyboard is meant to be used to type hooked this up to my rig and when try to type anything literally nothing happens then like secs later the first letter of what tried to type pops up then nothing happens if the description of this keyboard would ve said light up keyboard for display use only then out of stars since it is advertised as useful keyboard and gaming keyboard at that have to say don buy it buy literally anything else and maybe even letters might get typed 
1,amazing for the price

0,i bought jbl speakers which had high reviews did not know needed to install an app to get them in stereo installed the app confirmed by google play store and cant find it on my computer went to jbl video on youtube for help and they want me to watch two video ads first no thank you this is way too complicated update dont know how this product averages stars have two units that no longer use as went back to wired speakers aaaaaaaaaaaahhhh hear that that is the sound of me no longer being frustrated by wireless speakers the bluetooth lag is simply unacceptable once you figure how to pair the speakers in stereo then you have to press button on each speaker every time you want stereo there is only one active speaker in each unit the battery on one of the units never fully charges takes very long time to charge them if you lived close to me then would give them to you for free no longer want them 
0,didn realize until the unboxing that in order for the lights to work need usb not super big issue it was gift for my son birthday he likes them very much
0,worked well for while but then stopped working completely after months it would charge but not turn on 
0,i wish the earpieces were little twisty but im just nit picking here 
0,while the mouse was ok at the beginning it is now lagging after about months of use ve had to order new mouse already to replace this one 
1,for the price it very good quality its not too heavy but not so light that it feels cheap like the cord length and the cushions feel good on my ears 
1,i was just trying to buy cheap mic until could afford really nice one turns out don need nice mic any time soon it has crisp audio for gaming it works on the playstation xbox one and even the pc ve had mics that weren half as good as this one if you on budget you can get anything better than this 
0,battery inside the mouse is it not recharable it not working after battery life gone so after months of usage it not working try to change the battery but it very difficult to change battery need to open the top cover and removing batter is not easy even after changed the battery also it not working it looks like one time use only 
1,bought this for my new laptop bought and love this mouse the color changing amuses me so that is why thought hmmm ok will buy it and so happy did 
1,straight out of the box it is sleek and feels good in my hand however it does not read on or off the mousepad very disappointed 
1,got it for xbox they re pretty decent for the price sound quality it great along with noise cancelling only thing didn like is that in order for the lights to work it has to be plugged in usb

1,is perfect for jamming out in the pool 
1,great quality waterproof and very durable

0,i like music batter
0,had these for around months when the right side speaker stopped working
1,great head phones

1,great mouse overall very light weight and soundless led lights on the mouse work well too 
1,our son loves it says it good and plays with his friends uses it on nintendo switch to play fortnite affordable def recommend it
1,the pros decent mouse for what needed like that it is rechargeable via usb port and can be used as both wireless and wired when plugged in and recharging the cons these first two are mostly preferences so take them however you wish it sits fairly flat so there isn much arch of your hand to rest on depending on what you are used to in mouse this just makes it slightly less comfortable to use based on my personal preferences secondly it has silent soft click normally when you click mouse you feel and hear the click of the button this feels more like am pressing on touch screen there is no satisfying click nor is there sudden give in the button rather it feels like poking couch cushion this could be what you want in mouse so do with this info what you will this last con is not based on preferences however found that occasionally my cursor will studder step to the left when am moving the mouse to the right with the dual screens have this means that end up with my cursor all the way over on the other end of my work space when trying to get to the right to close tab or select tool in my adobe programs it nothing that has caused too many problems as it only happen every once in awhile but it was enough to stand out and earn it place in this review 
1,comfortable headset and solid upgrade from my previous 
1,sometimes the keyboard lag don type fast either type slower then the average keyboard user but do like it easier to see what typing in the dark 
1,great product
0,loveee sooo pretty 
0,worked great at first but now the right click button does nothing am back to my track pad avoid this device cheap components
0,i purchased this little over months ago but used it only on the weekends on my personal laptop so not much usage on gaming or extensive clicking immediately noticed the charge does not hold up for less than than weekend days so started turning it off about months later noticed lagging in click response soon after clicks were not engaging replaced it with brand name you get what you pay for but thought should contact the manufacturer and ask for refund or replacement it been over weeks now and no response do not recommend this product or its manufacturer beware 
0,only worked for few months bought for son for christmas already broke
1,great little speaker good sound for the size 
1,my son wanted this for his macbook so will tell you it needs an adapter the macbook doesn have usb port but after that he is pleased with the performance he uses it to play games too and says it is responsive

1,great keyboard highly recommend 
0,was great mouse until it stopped working which was less than months after purchased it it was used and charged as per instructions then it suddenly stopped functioning all together would not purchase again because even with its low cost it not worth it to only get months use out of it do not recommend 
1,i like this keyboard because it is huge improvement over my old non backlit unit do believe that there is alot of room for us older folks with sight problems the back lighting would be much improved by making it all one color either bright white or the bright green increasing the size of the letters numbers and symbols would also help the unit functiond well and it was easy to put into operation it is very light weight and is not as flimsy as some others who have rated it have mentioned it is keyboard not hammer 
0,its pretty dope 
0,charger not included it good speaker but wish the battery life lasted bit longer 
0,this mouse only stayed charged for hours if that long not very helpful when working hours day 
0,just what expected thanks
0,the charging cord is so short and flimsy it won stay connected to both pieces so it is difficult to get full charge the mouse does not hold charge after be left on the charger overnight it is dead within five minutes use

1,fun little mouse doesn feel overly sturdy but cute lites are fun 
1,awesome
1,jbl as you know prides itself on high quality sound this company far exceeds anyone expectations when it comes to great sounding audio and solid build quality the jbl charge is very rugged and tough water proof speaker that really delivers on high quality sound this portable speaker is great for any party no matter the type and it works great with any genre of music when purchased this speaker already knew what was getting because had heard this speaker inside church where they had of them going all connected together and quite frankly they sounded like very expensive sound system and due to the wide expanse of the church sancturary the bass resonated very well from the music and all the mids and highs were also there there isn bit of speaker hiss or distortion from these speakers no matter how many are connected oh let me tell you about stereo mode now that is really sweet jbl really knew what they were doing when they implemented stereo mode for these speakers because let me tell you the stereo mode makes the music quite emerssive and realistic jbl sound signature is great and it definitely deserves star reward for excellence and quality the fact that you can connect of these together means that you can have sound all around you if you like believe me you ll be amazed at the bass that these little guys put out and the great stereo mode when connecting two of them together listen to all genres of music but my favorites are edm house and trance as well as country and soft rock edm music really bangs on these you will have your own version of the clubs when you use these speakers other genres of music sound great on them as well thanks to jbl signature sound which is extremely clear and detailed without any distortion whatsoever and since today music is all digital you need that kind of sound because nothing else will do the jbl charge speakers are definitely star in my book and urge everybody to get pair or of them if you can afford it haha as far as comparison between other similar speakers these put bose to shame matter of fact they blow bose clear out of the water bose ain got nothing on these speakers guaranteed now sony is good runner up but sony has small problem with sounding little muffled in my opinion actually own the jbl boombox and that monster really cranks out the bass and it is very loud the charge speakers are also very loud too for their size which is why am so impressed with them also love the fact that they have an ipx rating which means that you can put them in the water yes you can use these speakers in your shower you could take shower in stereo yep totally water proof stereo now isn that something hey if you had smart phone that was also water proof the entire stereo system could go in the shower with you haha hmmm new adult pool toy your water proof stereo so if were you would get these bad boys today and let the party begin 
1,pretty cool devise easy to install no instructions needed
1,great mouse love the lights when using it 
1, finally sleep mode works on this upgraded led mouse sleep mode is must for mouse because not every time you ll remember to turn it off plus why bother turning it off while your going for short break or so it does it for you to save battery note sleep mode does work on color mode the previous mouse wouldn sleep on color mode but this upgraded mouse surly does and wish it had bluetooth it would be the perfect mouse 
0,sound quality is decent for the price point in the segment one complaint is the lowest volume setting is too loud for an office setting which was the main purpose of my purchase the drivers are ok for the size but don expect to hear all the lows from your music it better than most but for the money rather have spent little more and gotten larger more versatile speaker 
1,this wireless rechargeable mouse is exactly what wanted its light and just the right size for my laptop with so many options on amazon glad chose this product and the sleep mode function and colors are really cool would recommend this product to anyone looking for awesome mouse 
0,it been about months since bought this the piece that goes into your laptop to make it wireless completely fell apart and mouse no longer clicks would not recommend

0,i use it to join conferance calls at home decided to buy it after borrowing my sons headset which he uses for gaming 
0,they work really well with my xbox 
1,i enjoy the bengoo stereo gaming headset mostly for the noise cancellation and the comfy ear cushion makes hearing the game much better as my were ears are less tired after long gaming session 
1,purchased for my year old daughter she absolutely loves it sleek design great for small desks and true to color highly recommend 
0,for me personally just not good fit
0,i tried to charge my phone from percent and it killed the speaker they both died within half hour with the speaker being fully charged not deal breaker because the speaker does sound awesome just dont rely on charge from it 
1,this keyboard fit what needed for my gaming chats its so awesome bought one for birthday gift for friend he loves it too

1,son loved it 
0,nice product 
1,they are comfortable was playing with my friend and he could tell the difference from my old ones but if you want to have the light on you have to plug it up to your console or the wall
0,it has all the necessary features needed 
0,good speaker
0,it functions according to my expectation 
1,it has amazing quality for gaming highly suggest this item
0,ergonomic smooth and quiet this is the third one ve bought and ll never go back to another one charge lasts more than week and never turn mine off
0,serves its purpose for everyday use teacher who uses their laptop daily worked great for about months and then the middle wheel stopped working

0,didn last it stopped working already
0,automatically sets up 
0,full sound crisp definition of whatever you have playing 
0,great speaker but pre opened box 
1,i always wanted mouse which is similar to the apple one and found this to use for my windows laptop its very stylish rgb light looks pretty cool like the sleep feature it goes to sleep pretty quickly saving the battery and also that the mouse is rechargeable 
1,it is okay the scroll wheel and clicker are quiet but the mouse emits super high frequency noise any time it moves have become aware of it and can stand using it much anymore 
1,nice little mouse have gotten compliments on it functions as expected 
1,my yr old daughter loves them 
1,well it help my daughter with her school work and so she can hear the teacher very well
1,good wireless mouse portable ergonomic and the size is just right love how it has lights and changing colors 
0,does not last x
0,the sound quality on these is absolutely terrible for gaming tried them with music as well also terrible the volume wheel is upside down backwards the mic is worthless and not working properly the led lights are worthless for gaming on anything other than pc it is one cord with very small split at the end one to go into the controller and the other is usb for the lights to work but you can use the lights and play on the ps or xbox at the same time which makes these pretty pointless in that aspect there is no noise cancelation whatsoever out of would not recommend these look and sound nice when you read the description and reviews but they are absolute trash wouldn even buy them for my kids 
0,clicking this mouse takes so much force have to physically move my arm to get the leverage to do it and if ever pick the mouse up off the pad my cursor moves erratically around even if it pointed at the ceiling literally the most important things for mouse pointing and clicking are useless on this thing looks nice though

1,i bought this mouse because saw it was wireless silent click which was perfect for me working in class room and not loving to hear the click of mouse all day have dropped it times and each time have been able to just move the plastic back into place and repair so the duriablily from drops is awesome for when move between classes to see my different classes 
1,i didn buy this to game but to use with my macbook that is connected to my multiple screens liked it of the lit up keys find them to be hard to push and not comfortable guess could just be used to my mac keyboard and just being too hard on how the keyboard is supposed to function would like for it to stay lit up all the time while it breathes lights up as if it were breathing guess can understand why it doesn like it and would recommend it though it is relatively plug and play even on my mac works lot better for sure on windows systems for all the other functions of the keys 
1,first let me say that this jbl portable speaker isn toy this has weight to back up the power sound it brings so if your looking to bring your party anywhere this speaker will bring it it also waterproof but don recommend anyone taking there party to the shower sound check

0,good
1,it an adequate speaker for this price point ll cover the points addressed in other reviews but the short version is the speaker is fine do not feel like wasted money but if when buy another of these types of speakers it won be jbl it been at least years since ve bought one of these bt speakers and my last speaker was just as loud clear cost less had features that just worked and even came with lanyard for easy carry this thing would be hard to carry for someone with small hands volume and sound quality it loud in room with no ambient noise my music is mostly rock like metallica pantera white zombie like loud music and for my private office it perfect ll mostly listen at volume so can think but it nice to jam out sometimes at middle volume level the sound is the best lows vs highs above half volume the bass tapers off and mostly just the highs are increased volume wise you could use this in an environment with ambient noise like warehouse or kitchen but you would need to stay around if you want to really enjoy what is playing after it probably going to sound more like noise than music phone connectivity is simple for music just push top button but not automatic for phone calls like it was with my other speaker had in the price point there are some reviews that cover troubleshooting this the manual certainly is no help but it not what needed it for just liked it as nice side feature used sometimes with my last speaker like this battery life is fine haven done complete testing on this it does have pretty significant battery in it for the charge your device option but hrs maybe at the lowest volume playing nice simple music won need it for longer than hrs most of the time so doubt this will come up as an issue for me there an app but it does very little for this speaker most useful feature is digital copy of the horrible instructions that come with the speaker thankfully for it main function of bt connecting and playing music it pretty basic and simple if you go the route of multiple speakers reads the reviews for the app on how to make that work it is not intuitive it series of linear steps which the instructions do not help with and if you do it wrong all kinds of weird issues were reported in the reviews 
1,we are very pleased with these headphones the quality and price are great 
0,good in battery saving automatically gets in sleep mode if not used this saves battery

1,the mouse hooks up easily and does what it advertised to do hassle free 
0,it disconnects at times requiring you to unplug the usb connection and reconnect 
0,broke already won charge can return stay away from this mouse 
1,great sound quality
0,once got this product read the manual and did everything step by step including charging the mouse and it will not work after minutes of messing with it the led lights started flashing and got it to work for little while then it stopped again this product is not good and needed it for school but would hate to take an exam and have these issues 
1,very lightweight and easy to use highly recommend this product changing leds really make it more enjoyable experience would definitely repurchase again in the future awesome customer service 
1,great mouse
0,nice the only problem ve noticed so far is it really hard to click the scroll middle button it just really stiff 
1,the mouse is contained in japanese package but was made in china it comes with the type adapter charging usb cable regular usb mouse receiver and thin instructions ve plugged the type adapter into two different machines with the same result neither laptops read the type directly or through another adapter ve also tried another wireless mouse receiver in the type with the same results none of them work through this adapter other than that issue the mouse works it also goes to sleep so by clicking the mouse one is able to use it again the also other nice feature is that it is wireless with no battery included just plug in the charging cord into an empty usb slot the color changing around the rim of the mouse gives nice touch and although at first the mouse feels long due to it sleek shape it does fit comfortably in the hand it also has plastic like feeling and on the instructions it says to avoid dropping the mouse so it doesn malfunction or break 
0, star just for the misleading title maybe the public is too ignorant to realize that waterproof and water resistant are not even the same discussion 
0,very disappointed the mouse doesn hold charge even if you leave it on for short period of time while not using it you must recharge it would not buy again 
0,good for the price
1,i got this mouse for my daughter and she was beyond excited when we finally received it well day it wouldn charge so gave it break and decided to try charging it on my mac she had originally tried her school chrome book few seconds of it being plugged in it started smoking it smelled like burning plastic so quickly just unplugged and didn bother doing anything else with the mouse 
0,like it
0,scroll wheel broke within few weeks of use 
0,it works okay but my scrool wheel doesn work and it never jad
0,i recently had it dunged below water for at least hours with ill effects so far
1,got this to match the skin works great
1,this mouse is cute and convenient not heavy the shiny black color looks nice against the colors and it is quiet works fine with my macbook air the only thing is that the usb adaptor it comes with is very hard to insert it into the port that it comes but besides that everything works fine 
1,there nothing dislike about this wireless mouse that use with my laptop computer would recommend this to anyone that would ask me about it 
0,someone has missed the point there doesn seem to be way to keep the lights on either wirelessly which is the point of purchasing wireless keyboard or wired not power saving move as the shut off timing is the same with the keyboard plugged in the backlighting when it is on is not helpful as it barely shows through the key to highlight the number or letter but shows off the space around the keys so when looking down on the keyboard the eye is drawn to the space around the keys instead of the key itself completely uselessa strange design choice also interferes with the use of the keyboard there is an extra key next to the enter return which is really annoying instead of hitting enter you are more likely to hit backslash which really makes entering passwords joy this key is above the enter key on every other keyboarda very bad choice on my part from all the wireless backlit keyboards available
1,i love it just like the description 
1,that its water proof sounds great
0,it cool mouse the led features are nice and it pretty but hate when have to move it sporadically for good seconds before the mouse moves on the screen ve tried different mouse pads and it still happens it extremely frustrating and it happens as soon as you stop using for any period of time and go back to using it you have to left and right click numerous times before it will respond now it also makes an irritating high pitched noise when you move it 
1,cheap cheap cheap cheapquit working like day and now am outside of return window good thing it was cheap buyers beware spend little more 
0,complete trash would not charge 
0,not great headset but probably good for somebody trying to get started with gaming 
0,the lights also like the noise blockage 
1,i love this wireless mouse the lights are great and easy to assemble if you need wireless mouse for your laptop get this 
1,love them recommend
0,i ordered two and within one time use neither one of them works any longer what kind of horrid product is this company supplying company like amazon with and they are not cheap by any means so disappointed in amazon allowing this product to be sold on their site have never been so distraught with any of my purchases with amazon ever but this one really places shame on amazon would like full replacement for both because have two work pcs for my job one for the usa and another pc for accounts out of the country latin america that was the purpose for purchasing two

0,the right click button stopped working within few weeks troubleshot by reboot control panel settings and even recharge overnight no luck 
1,great product very nice and very nice price my daughter love it 
0,this is functional in the sense that it does have keys too bad it has minute battery life and you cannot use it while it charging absolute trash product tempted to just throw it away 
0,the mouse is comfortable to use with its very slim low profile its accuracy is normal or average to the regular computer user mine did not come with the type receiver assume it was sold once before and not checked to see if all parts were there before reselling the most annoying thing about the mouse is having to charge over and over again you have to remember to plug it in everyday for the user who is on the his or her computer lot there is no meter to check for how much battery is left and can be annoying when it starts being erratic because it needs juicing up it seems to go into sleep mode really quickly so you will have to click button to start moving again slight annoyance not bad mouse for the price but the annoying things about it have me going back to replaceable battery ones that am used to using the colors are nice and pretty but you get over that really quick 
0,while the shape of this rechargable mouse is nice the crappy battery refused to be recharged after less than three months don buy this 
0,ordered this mouse in mid may in june it started acting bit off and could only use it turned on to one certain position yesterday august th the roller ball on top stopped working and now can scroll screens without using the sidebar very disappointed in how quickly this mouse stopped working my grandmother always said you get what you pay for and in this instance she was correct 
1,great sound great battery strong construction fits well in packs if you ve done the research you know the differences between what you are looking for if you haven and skipped to reviews sound is better than the charge not as big or loud as the extreme but still impressive fatter and more rugged than the flip jbl is good brand 
0, bought this mouse read direction simple and easy plug in to phone charger for hrs then unplug mouse will turn blue say it need to be charged hrs then it will turn red then go to mouse plug in the usb port in to windows computer then turn button on mouse underneath to on then try mouse out to see if it moves on computer give this out of stars dont give in to bad reviws people post bad reviews and never reads instruction first
1,i use this for when am showering and got it to replace bose bt speaker that is about years old it was no longer holding charge and kept disconnecting from the bt the sound is so good ve taken it around the house with me it came partially charged so fully charged it before used it ve had it for weeks now and haven had to charge it yet the sound quality is incredible the bass is window shaking if you are on the fence get it it supposed to be waterproof too but haven tested it love it

1,great product and very happy with my purchase quiet buttons when pressed and love the different color lights 
0,this gaming headset does not light up when you play this only lights up when plugged in to the usb for charging only initially bought it because thought the led would show when gaming which is the main purpose but was wrong plus the cables are way to short to have it plugged in and the surround system is bad wouldn recommend buying this cheap mic 
0,purchased received it worked my son used it for few days but was afraid to tell me that it stopped working just after days of use unfortunately the return window ended but it is completely useless tested it and mic does not work super upset rn 
1,cool lights my son loves it
0,great for the first month got now one of them sounds like crap buzzing on the bass even at moderate volume don blast it either so figure it must be build quality update second one has gotten flaky after running the power to zero once it is usually plugged in all the time as speaker for my amazon echo and got unplugged when furniture got moved disappointed that flagship company like jbl would have such poor quality

1,got this so can pair with my charge works great louder and better sound than will always go jbl can beat for the price 
1,works great
0,broke within two hours of using it you really gotta watch the amazon return policy on electronics have tendency to buy it and leave it sitting in the box for way too long bad me because this is the second or third time ve gotten burned on crap like this 
1,perfect just what needed love that can use with my mac and pc mouse is smooth fast and accurate 
0,this mouse stops working even when fully charged and the light on the bottom is on this did not start happening until weeks after the return window ended would not recommend buying this for these reasons it was waste of money 
1,the sound is really impressive on this headset and like the sturdy mic rather than bendy one you can really complain for the price but the mic is mid it isn like razer mic duh but it picks up your voice just find with minimal background noise it comparable to my logitech webcam mic hope this helps 
0,it works as expected 
1,pretty strong luv the mic but volume should be able to turn alil more than allow to also the cord is long enough they are comfortable around my ears
1,this mouse is great for what use it for like the rgb effects not really designed for gaming
0,nothing wrong

1,sound quality is far superior than others bluetooth and connectivity is excellent highly recommend 
1,great sound have one on my patio and one with my camping gear
1,i really liked the mouse at first it matched perfectly and was very convenient first thing noticed was how plasticy it was that didn bother me tho one day as was using the mouse to scroll the little scroll wheel fell into the mouse tried to fix it and couldn wasn pressing hard on it and it always stayed on my desk its cute mouse love the look of it but it is very cheaply made and will most likely break 
0,live it
1,the noise cancellation is great had these headphones for little over year before my dog thought it be cute to chew through the extra thick braiding on the cord would recommend trying these if you re on budget 
0,no complaints
0,they work

1,light weight very easy to use charging lasts for long like that it has the usb attachment in mouse making it perfect for travel
1,this product came on time as expected am satisfied with my purchase as it is well worth the money 
0,they know the microphones are faulty they know the microphones only work for like week the seller doesn matter the brand doesn matter there are million versions of these cheap headsets pros they are loud enoughcons the microphone will break it not maybe it will break also they didn have the giant usb portion of the wire in the photos had to cut it off thus was advertised as pc and console headphones do any of you know console controller with usb port for led lights on headphones didn think so don buy these for console and go ahead and rip the microphone off 
1,headphones are great sound quality is good and my voice is clear
1,great headset
1,won recharge after owning it for about months only used it hand full of times 
0,keyboard worked great for the longest time but ive had it for bit over year and now typing is progressively become more difficult due to the lost key presses its got bad enough to affect games now so my player stops and takes stuttering steps before returning back to normal for short while 
1,pros sound quality is decent the in line volume control is convenient and they look really cool cons at least my particular headset had constant static noise even when use the mute switch on the volume control actually had to unplug the mic cable when was playing as to not annoy the other players

0,quality and premium sound 
1,they are pretty good
0,i like for gaming noise cancellation and sound quality
1,i love this mouse it matches the decor in my home office perfectly 
0,this was purchased for pc that occasionally gets used for gaming but nothing intensive on the like side is the backlit keys which are multi colored and bright and readable when all other lights are out in the room something have struggled to find in other purchased keyboards second is the sleep mode which immediately responds when key is depressed bringing the keyboard back to life and recording the initial keystroke to the screen have mid high corsair that cannot do that at times the price tag and battery life is way longer than the more expensive corsair my only dislike is the change the manufacturer made in the enter return key all of my other keyboards without exception have horizontal return key this one has moved the key with the forward slash mark to the row next to the quotation marks key allowing the return key to be vertical rather than horizontal for touch key typist this creates problem since the pinky finger now has an additional full key width space to cross to get the return key it did not have with other keyboards for gamers this is an acceptable inexpensive keyboard and well worth the money for touch typist you might want to pick something else as the change in the return key is very frustrating this is an update from original initial review device did not last year and stopped working altogether as did the expensive corsair have gone back to good wired keyboard 
0,mouse wheel doesn work

1,i originally ordered the white version but when got it realized it was see through asked the shop owner whether this was just an issue with the version ordered or what all the white mouses look like they re all white according to the shop because raised concern they were so kind to ship different color to me free of charge didn even have to return the original 
0,i ordered this mouse in april and it no longer holds charge 
1,pretty cool mouse honestly was only looking for simple mouse to use with my laptop the tracking works great and the colors are pretty cool nothing like adding little color to your workstation being able to recharge the mouse is plus 
0,for gaming noise cancelation 
0,nice
0,had this mouse less than week my kids knocked it off my desk the mouse broke in half and will not snap back together has no durability save your money and buy more reputable brand my prior mouse was dropped dozens of times with no issues will be ordering one from that brand this one is not worth the money 
0,he really likes the headset but they hurt his ears bit after while of use 
1,for the size this speaker is great 
0,i have charged this mouse once since received it use it every day it been over month now and no signs of low battery yet crazy 
0,i bought this weeks ago and now the scroll doesn work if you need mouse choose something other than this 
0,worked great for month then the center button stopped working 
1,these are great for gaming love the way it feels on my head and great sound quality
0,these headphones are very lightweight and sound quality was pretty decent for the price range would buy again 
1,this light up mouse is great and ve had few similar ones like that this one is rounded on the edges more aesthetically pleasing imo it holds charge for long enough that it not annoying though it would be nice if there was an option to turn the light off while using to save charge even more the options are just on constant red light or cycles through colors clicks are definitely as close to silent as you could get the only thing that is bothering me is that the wheel is squeaking after only weeks of use intend to drop some wd onto it and sure that will fix the problem but don think that should be necessary to begin with overall good choice though immediate update directing wd into the wheel well of the mouse is not easy even using pin dropped the mouse and now the wheel doesn scroll at all it just spins soooooo not great removing star either accept the squeaky wheel or be very careful when trying to oil said wheel because if you drop it it will die ugh
0,very smooth and quiet 
1,i like this headset because it doesn echo and its really good so use it for gaming 
1,i teacher so don want to be attached to my computer at the front the whole day this mouse keeps good charge allows me to walk around my class the whole time stays attached to me the colors just add bit of fun to it 
1,my yr old loves it takes it everywhere and even while taking shower lol great sounds and battery life last forever very pleased
1,so far great purchase bought rose gold and it looks so cute mouse works well slim and compact 
0,i purchased this mouse thinking it had usb connector not usb with usb adaptor my bad opted to keep it three stars on its scrolling as it was not smooth but it worked would have kept it but after couple of weeks it died and would not charge despite being plugged in for hours don waste your money go with tried and true brand
1,excellent
0,nice product but it works on everything except for an xbox one which is what have in order to use it with the xbox one it requires adapter which was not mentioned in the description
1,love my sound box 
0,bought of these in april both dead purchased two of these for two computers one died about weeks ago to me it seemed the battery wasn holding charge contacted klm for product support sent three emails and heard nothing in return klim product support no matter how fancy their webpage is then grabbed the other one and started using it on my fulltime pc and it died today the fact that one used daily and the other used half as much both died within weeks of each other is very telling two keyboards lasted months if this isn the definition of junk don know what it 
1,easy to set up stable on most surfaces charging cord could be longer perhaps feet long 
1,it really nice exactly what wanted except when it changes in light it does automatically and the transition is bit glitchy at times but still love it 
1,pretty solid headphones especially for the price ve paid double for other headphones didn like as much 
1,worked perfectly was concerned it wouldn work with my new samsung galaxy probook but the little piece for the drive worked great as soon as attached the usb provided if you re worried it won be compatible don be it worked 
1,great
0,stopped working after months and actual uses garbage 
0,i do presentations for work and can plug my lap top into the television and use the mouse to advance slides 
1,i upgraded to the charge and must say the charge sounds way better thinking about returning my charge in favor of the charge due to it not being stereo speaker but mono like everyone is saying also the charge has crisper sound 
0,the mouse scroller broke within month
0,my first impression of this mouse was that the design was not well thought out because ordered the mouse in white the inner workings of the lights can be seen through the top of the mouse every time you move it and you can turn off the red light because the white plastic is translucent however ignored this issue because it was purely an aesthetic problem and didn mess with the functionality of the mouse unfortunately week or so later the mouse wheel completely stopped working ve since then gotten new mouse for even cheaper and not only does it look better but it also feels better and holds up well don waste your money
0,so so
1,fantastic 
1,i ve hooked this up to my ps to use while playing ffxiv and it seamlessly works to type better than the controller does still have to use the controller to get to the chat box but that doesn bug me love the coloring great for use in the dark 
1,letters are small and faint even with the back lighting perhaps there is way to increase the brightness
1,these headphones sound great and the noise cancellation is amazing but unfortunately the mic audio output full doesn seem to be good when play online on the xb with my friends they say my mic volume is too low after ve already adjusted the setting and have not had this issue with other mics great headset just wish the mic was better 
1,we used these headphones for virtual school with busy household they worked great 
0,i purchased the rose gold and it matches my airbook charges fast and lasts long time between charges glad bought this wireless mouse use it for hrs day days week 
0,for me personally just not good fit
0,fast shipping and quality as described 
1,great sound and quality 
0,i do not recommend this mouse worked all of days changed the batteries and it still does not work spend your money on basic mouse that works 
1,i bought this product in november by december the axle for the mouse wheel had snapped ll admit liked the size and look of it enough to buy it again here we are in february and the same exact thing has happened again used this mouse for my work computer in the office and certainly don aggressively use the scroll wheel yet the same axle has snapped on two of these units both within the first weeks of use ve never had mouse break apart like this before so have to conclude that this is just utterly cheap in the way it is made and the parts holding it together suppose you get what you pay for shame because aesthetically it is very nice will never buy this product again would advise anyone else to save your money and stay away pay few extra dollars and find something that lasts more than few weeks side note look forward to having the seller reach out to me to take down my review rolls eyes perhaps ll just copy and paste their request here for the rest of you to read ha
0,stopped working after weeks would not buy again 
1,beautiful and easy product company quick to respond to any questions highly recommended 
0,so many uses 
0,i bought this in and it has been very big disappointment it has constant connection issues today finally gave up and am ready to throw this thing in the trash where it belongs do yourself favor and go with keyboard that can connect without issues more than ft away

0,mousewheel doesn work yikes
0,i would not recommend this item bought this for my daughter for school it quit working after two weeks was going to buy another one but decided to wait to see how this one would work so glad didn buy another one when put it on the charger it does not work would not recommend this item at all if you buy it you re wasting your money we liked it because the light so tried to put it onto another charger and it did not work either so don know what the problem is would not recommend this do not buy it here an update keep receiving emails from the seller wanted me to change my review don think that how it should work because the item did not work they want me to change my review to good review or they want me to delete it and pay me money for it so now this is the second email have received the first email they wanted to pay me the second email they want to pay me when you buy something online your post to do review of your item so do not recommend this item
1,i love this like to work with dim lights in my office and this helps with my tasks charge lasts for week or so 
1,i bought this mouse for my wife but loved it so much that had to get second for myself it has really great feel and it works really well
0,cable length isnt bad and audio is decent dont recommend it for the microphone since have to essentially put it in my mouth for it to work but solid pair of headphones for the price
1,i love this mouse it fits my hands perfect use it lot and haven had any problems 
0,i would be as bothered by the fact the charge switched to mono if they would ve at least centered the damn speaker blows my mind the majority of people that buy this will probably think the thing is broken because of that no way would pay full price for the charge when the is stereo much cheaper and likely sounds better 
1,perfect so far feels more premium than the cost definitely great beginner headphone for gaming 
1,i love this mouse the colors are beautiful and ve gotten many compliments on it it feels great to use as well took away one star because the charging cord stopping working about day after using it easily charges with any micro usb though it been couple months and still works being used every day at work 
1,im in love with this speakers have purchased three already and love them 
1,very comfortable and the sleep mode works well it looks good too
1,love the speaker sound quality is good however we have had the hardest time the speaker willpower off and then somehow power itself back on it randomly turns on and you randomly connect to it tried customer service but couldn get anyone on the phone who could hear me clearly or understand english now have speaker have to keep plugged in and disconnect and turn off blue tooth or it just automatically connects 
0,it broke after only week the little thing in the middle to scroll stopped scrolling got one just like it from walmart for cheaper and it actually bluetooths to the computer 
1,i use when on the run something to blue tooth with great product 
0,very disappointed my daughter was extatic about getting these only to be disappointed in quality and difficulty hearing with the volume up don waste your
1,this portable speaker packs big sound in small package it offers truly great sound quality easy instant pairing to my iphone and nice design aesthetic got this to replace bose soundlink that was adorable and smaller but finicky when pairing with my phone very happy with this purchase for poolside tunes 
0,i just received this product today and even though there were numerous good reviews unfortunately cannot leave positive one due to the fact that this is useless due to non functional otg plug 
1,i not mouse person prefer the track pad but need it for work absolutely love it even use it on my personal computer
0,not bad for the money but keys are very stiff and not ideal for typing prolong use will cause finger and wrist pain wanting to find quieter alternative for my razer mechanical keyboard but this one does not cut it it is quiet though 
0,there is so much unnecessary wiring really excessive amount of weight for mic on off and volume false picture advertisement no blue light are in not worth the money 
1,perfect 
1,works great only cons what that had handle or space for hands to go when carrying wish they had more bass and bluetooth connection to connected speakers goes in and out with that being said stars
1,well the color is great but it stopped working after two uses tryed to charge it and it doesn even take charge won try anything from this vendor again 
0,was really clear
1,really nice keyboard its far quiet than mechanical keyboard which is what want the finger resist is slightly higher but its fine battery lasts me about week on full brightness there is not many cons so am nick picking but every time you turn off the keyboard it forgets your settings and the actual placing of the off button is unusual so just always leave it on now its really just to stop the cat walking on it anyways highly recommend it espcially if your computer doesnt have bluetooth
1,it smaller than used to and light the battery seems to work well and don turn on and off just goes to sleep it has the enter bar in different configuration and is tighter than than used to and that has been change to get accustomed to like it though 
0,my son says the mic does not work good sound for the headset but does not do what it says
1,this was ordered for my year old and she loved it it made very well and works great 
0,the product seemed good and liked it until was just using it normally then it just stopped working tried charging it turning it off and on and reconnecting it but it still didn work would not recommend this to anyone and ve had it only couple of weeks 
0,the product is used for gaming 
1, this is just below better than the spent on another headset do use the lights but enjoy the option mute button and control volume cancels out like surrounding noises which also enjoy because don like to be completely clueless to my surroundings comfy headset compared to the universal elastic ones other designs have
1,it great product when you evaluate price and quality 
0,not what you want do not order nothing explained correctly at all you cannot light it up unless you can play your box looking at it from behind usb only for the light computer usb too many wires and too short too enjoy do not buy you will be very disappointed buy lot from amazon but will not buy bengoo products ever again 
0,hit the key and it also types the key these keys aren even near each other 
1,bought this mouse for my wife to use with her new macbook air must say this mouse has exceeded all expectations very happy with my purchase and will refer anyone looking for quality mouse to this business 
1, pros quiet smooth no delays or lagging issues so far pretty colors when not moving the mouse cons seems bit cheap little flatter than like doesn fit naturally to my palm so it makes it uncomfortable the red optical light shines through the other pretty colors when you re moving the mouse want to see the various colors even when moving the mouse not red led light shining through which is overpowering some of the colors shine all throughout and for much longer while others barely show the right side of the mouse right handed doesn emit the colors as vividly as the left side next to my thumb one small section is almost inoperative ll probably be returning it as have bought another mouse that also changes colors and it doesn emit the red led like this one it was super cheap fortunately in case keep it who knows guess you get what you pay for 
0,loud and long lasting use it at work and it it plenty loud enough
1,excellent
1,comfortable and responsive mouse clicking is indeed very quiet lights are just as advertised and battery is more than satisfactory can use multiple days without charging 
0,no need for further comments here this product will speak for itself
1,amazing soubd
1,the usb plug broke and the case around the chip got stuck inside the port can pull the usb out but the case stays inside the port it still useable if put it back in though it also has very high pitched dog whistle kind of noise when it moves especially when it used close to the usb plug it is not silent that for sure have to use music or headphones when use this mouse or it drives me insane it shallow depth is kind of hard on my hand but have arthritis so usually need thicker taller mouse to fill my palm to be comfortable but bought this mouse as backup for my work laptop so don use it as much as use my gaming mouse like that you can still use it when it plugged in to charge if you use longer cable 
1,so far so good great keyboard 
0,my grandson has no sound bought it for him 
1,very loud very good quality bought the for my husband playstation he loves them
0,don bother doesn work
1,took chance and ordered this for at the office wanted something little more comfortable and without cord excellent choice love love love this mouse and the charge staying power is amazing
0,absolute garbage you can hearly hear people on it even when turned up and they can hardly hear you over the static ve troubleshooted it and it just awful won work right 
1,the sound is not as good as the extreme model but it does sound better good for the money wished had bought the extreme though
1,pretty good so far no complaints
1,i travel for work so this wireless mouse is perfect it small for packing away and the sleep mode keeps it going longer charge it about every days 
0,they were decently sounding with good amount of noise cancellation however these were more intended for pc because there is two cords one for sound and one for the lights the cord is too short to connect it to the ps also the cord is big and gets in the way too much while gaming 
0,i chose this mouse because it lit up like the rest of my accessories however the lights are so dim they are barely noticeable it extremely light weight however feel it is going to break easily since the plastic is so thin so far for gaming ve had no issues with performance of the mouse itself 
0,if try connecting two or more the music is delayed and jumpy like they are buffering it and not sure whos playing what or when when they are solo they kick ass 
1,great sound quality portability and batter life for the price very easy to swith between bluetooth devices 
1,great service fast delivery got this for my new laptop like it didnt know that it chages colors thought that was pretty cool when you turn mouse over on the bottom theres spot where it turns on or off and picture of sun and that changes the color of the mouse that is nice just got this the other day to match my laptop as its pink rose color and love it it slim and doesnot hurt my fingers when scrollig which like
0,ready to handle
0,the mouse is cute and like the colours but it dies every hour and have to plug it back in and just revert back to the mouse pad will be returning and getting something more basic with longer range of not having to be charged up 
1,love it
1,great sound 
1,great product 
1,worked okay for little while but then it became glitchy so bought one that plugs in works little bit better for now
0,doesn hold charge for even full day 
0,update downgrading from stars to jbl has terrible customer service at best if you have questions no one will help this comes with usb cord only nothing to charge to wall outlet if you want to hear text message sound notification through your speaker forget it the original jbl charge does allow message sound notifications you have to have your phone next to you constantly which totally defeats the purpose it step back will be returning this very disappointed 
1,this speaker is outstanding sound is great very well built am gonna buy another one for sure highly recommend this product 
0,didn seem to be that much louder than my flip 
0,i like that it glows when use the headphones 
0,the keyboard must be either front left or right of the keyboard not behind you like to use my computer while kicking up my legs with my wireless keyboard on my lap can do it well all the time because of the range is so poor on this keyboard would need to move the entire tower another part of the room to suit my sitting style or buy usb extender and hopefully move the signal usb stick that comes with the keyboard to in front of me than my tower being behind me 
0,no battery life 
0,stopped working after couple of weeks
1,first off would like to say love this speaker it sounds amazing for the price and battery life is very good sit has year warranty to which had to use on my first one and have no complaints the battery quit charging so looked up the warranty and email them had no problems getting it replaced so my gripe is with the battery longevity life use mine everyday where work and getting about years out of this product but what do know not battery expert so for the price of this you can go wrong 
1,i really enjoy the mouse with the different colors that light up when clicking the left or right buttons on the mouse it is very quiet 
0,battery charge lasts many many days
0,i live it got it for my self
0,didn hold charge long but now won recharge at all just threw it in the trash had battery operated mouse for years until lost it going back to batteries 
1,they work perfectly for my son and his online gaming needs good buy great seller
1,love this speaker 
1,i only used this mouse for short while but it works very well was able to connect it using the usb transmitter very easily it does what it is supposed to do
0,wouldn spend your money on these cheaply designed broke within week volume is not that great save your money and spend little more to get decent pair
1,very skeptical at the beginning did lots of research on competitors let be honest this is not going to replace total sound system if that what you are dreaming of but this speaker goes from room to room and outside and gives sound that is of high enough quality for you not to feel like you are missing out on something better bought this for family member first saw how good it was then bought one for myself within the same week battery life is great would definitely recommend this 
1,its perfect
1,i bought this mouse recently for new laptop bought and it is perfect the mouse is an extremely portable wireless mouse it actually feels very comfortable while using it theres no side buttons or extras on it just simple portable mouse that cna connect via usb or with the included usb to usb adapter recommend this mouse because of the price and what you get for it 
0,i ordered this mouse because was tired of using my laptops track pad at school it arrived on time charges quickly has very satisfying and quiet mouse click sound and overall is great mouse for the price the only issue face is that the rgb on the front of the mouse is almost completely broken and there are small sections around the edges that are broken as well it doesn prevent the mouse from doing its job though and often find myself using the mouse with the rgb off anyway overall good mouse just don expect the rgb to work amazingly it is only after all 
0,son uses it for his xbox
1,excellent product easy to install and the keys are very soft it has very fast respond when playing shooting games
0,cant wait to use it 
0,i ve only had this for few months now and it is completely broken the scroll feature lost its traction and no longer works the battery life wasn great and it never worked flawlessly need new mouse now 
0,you get about hours use time on this and then you have to charge it up separately not worth the trouble 
1,definitely has sleek feel to it and the lights are pretty had it for week so far so good 
1,this mouse was purchased for use with my laptop ve purchased two of the same brand previously but wanted something different so took chance on this unknown the mouse is light and ergonomic have fairly small hand and it fits well connection was simple the sleep mode will definitely increase battery life add to this the pretty lights and lovely rose color pleasantly surprised would recommend this mouse to anyone who wants an inexpensive and uncomplicated addition to their setup 
1,i love this mouse so much bought another one love the soft click that it is rechargeable and the lights are great easy to install just stick the usb dongle into the computer and starr using probably the best mouse ve had 
0,one ear doesn even work waste of money was excited because my previous headphones broke but was extremely disappointed when the audio to the one side didn even work plus they re extremely uncomfortable if you wear glasses 
0,hello

0,not even months and they broke can even get ahold of manufacturer 
1,great product have nothing bad to say about this product worth every penny 
0,good sound
1,very nice mouse love the size and feel
0,i have macbook and it would not connect have charged the mouse for hours and still will not connect 
1,these are good for the money my year old likes them for gaming and listening to music 
1,i have only had this keyboard for few days now but from what can tell so far it is not bad little keyboard for the price 
0,i bought this because of the lights and it looked cool but it does not have battery it needs to be plugged in to charge unless you babysit it by always turning it off when you are done using it the charge dies after days and then you have dead mouse or one that is now wired as it charges too high maintenance for mouse 
0,it keeps shaking 
1,like design look feel soft touch silent click sleep feature single click to wake it up dislike it loses the charge bit quicker than prefer but works welledited from original review would recommend
1,bought this for my girlfriend for christmas did lot of research and decided on this bluetooth speaker the sound is fantastic which figured it would be coming from jbl she uses it with no issues connects right away and sounds fantastic 
0,stopped working months after got it
1,great headphones for gaming noise cancellation amazing for the price

1,love this mouse it works great has fun led light feature feels good in the hand and is easy to use 
1,great quality for the price
1,bought for my garage used less than times and won play turns on and immediately powers off even plugged in big waste of money 
0,easy to carry 
0,this product is not worth the money it stopped working all together after and months 
1,i like the size and how easy it is to use
1,there isn anything that don like about like it very much 
0,just doesn connect also doesn come with instructions except lousy troubleshooting that essentially just says to restart your computer and try plugging it into other devices sure let me grab all my other computers also no tech phone tech support and it not really silent bye 
1,i got the speaker and love it but won work with the jbl app so can get the bass up
0,ergonomic and nice

0,battery is running quickly have to charge every two weeks 
0,had troubles connecting when it did finally connect the cursor never appeared only the clickable buttons worked and would access random menus returned for full refund 
1,yeah this thing is pretty great honestly it works really well and is completely silent which really like at work don like to be constantly clicking all the time the rubberized feel is also very satisfying and mean very satisfying overall you really can go wrong here for the price 
1,the keyboard linked up to my laptop immediately and turned on the backlit color which was cool however the buttons and the keys themselves are very flimsy doesn feel like quality keyboard but it does look nice 
1,great keyboard for the price love the feel though somehow do feel it isn as hefty when typing than used to some people might like this light feel prefer heavier response when click work from home coder so use it on average minimum hours daily it lasted approx days on single charge not bad at all if you charge it overnight once week you shouldn have any problems with it dying randomly the auto sleep feature is nice to prolong the battery but when working it can be like off putting that the lights go out vs them constantly being on 
1,i love the comfort of the headset at first was little uncomfortable due to the fact never had headsets this large before but the comfort and the quality of the set adjust my way of thinking about the sets brought them for gaming and video calls the quality is great from the voice end to the listening side the mute is not difficult and easy to plug in and use 
0,this product was great but it started to no work this past sunday on the th of july got it back on the th of may it doesnt turn on anymore nor does it charge charged it up one time with the charging cord since ive got it
0,it was nice while it lasted unfortunately for me that was less than three months 
1,works great packs lot of power for the size great sound quality highly recommend it 
0,this speaker is definitely not the loudest but decent for the price built well durable bass quality and sound quality good not great very serviceable but they have higher quality and loader speakers available for more money 
1,love it 
0,sound quality less than advertised buy something else 
0,sleek and ergonomic to the touch 
1,this headset is great for gaming the sound quality is amazing for reasonably priced headset and it not bulky and fits on your head nicely
1,the speaker sounds amazing it looks amazing brought it to the beach the other day said it on the beach and went out into the water and could still hear it for quite ways my boyfriend has two that we have velcro mounted to our boat and honestly think two is too many because it is super loud but all around if you were looking for small portable loudspeaker this is exactly what you re looking for 
1,i love this product it very comfortable and stylish and versatile definitely would buy as gift for someone else 
1,very good nice sound mic doesn have problems
1,it works great great audio great mic lights are cool too 
1,it pretty comfortable and the noise canceling is pretty good it great for gamers especially starting gamers and younger gamers however not sure if it just me because have smaller head but they could look little funny big when wearing also when playing sometimes the people that talking to don really hear me well at times or can sound low soft another thing noticed is that when it plugged into my controller it sometimes make loud static noise often not sure if it because of the cord not being put right by myself or because of the cord itself 
1,this is the best headset ve ever used and for affordable price it not bad at all 
0,i ordered the track ball broken in the silver one within days the right click broke on the rose gold one within days only use them for light use no gaming and they are not sturdy at all they were both difficult to charge
1,this is great keyboard and really enjoyed it 
1,works great
1,dad bit deaf and had bose stuff in the past he asked me to order him bose version of this after some research bought this instead jbl charge dad loves it it works great and plays loud sound quality is better than would have expected from small speaker but it mono speaker so not exactly highfi and it in no way reference monitor for what it is it great 
0,i ve had this mouse for less than three months now thought it looked really cool at first no longer works at all and stuck without mouse again for my laptop 
0,it became sluggish and wasnt working properly with my mac after month or so 
0,didn work very well from the very beginning then it was dropped in water dried out and was even worse 
0,when received this product the first time it had come broken the entire click pad was nearly separated from the base and couldn easily be snapped back into place sent in for replacement and everything was all fine they sent replacement no problems this was in april flash forward to december mere eight months the mechanism that holds the scroll wheel somehow snapped apart and the scroll wheel is now useless which makes playing games bit difficult as many games use the scroll wheel when to contact customer service all contact is closed use caution when ordering this mouse at first the replacement had been sent was good despite it not exactly having any sort of indicator as to when the mouse needed to be charged but if the scroll wheel mechanisms are gonna snap easily under potentially hard gaming sessions perhaps pass for something more heavy duty 
1,excellent sound quality
0,i ve had this mouse for months and the wheel broke it the second mouse ve gotten like it and that other mouse wheel broke it much be cheap plastic it looks nice felt nice but not worth it when you have to buy one every months
1,i like very much this rgb wireless keyboard the batteries last forever beautiful color and brightness very silent just love it
1,it nice looking and the wife absolutely loves it and it vibrant colors got her the mint green one and it works like champ didn like the feel of big flat mouse under my hand but she said that it isn problem and likes it so that the important thing 
1,love how clearly you can hear 
0,just right for when working at night and not wanting to turn extra lights on 
0,there was very good audio quality 
1,i have many wireless mouses mice trying to find the right one for my home office studio bought this one for the slim design in the matte black finish it arrived and have never used mouse that this quiet before it insane it feels great when use it it smooth and very ergonomic this was definitely worth the price and may replace my other wireless devices with this model 
0,good for its intended purpose very light and flimsy but it works so far 
1,this has been great mouse thus far love the sleep mode and does not have large arch for your hand very much recommend 
0,the mouse itself was fine at first worked great and liked the shape and sound but the wheel started to squeak and it always scrolled too fast for my liking and now the mouse won work at all always jumping around the screen spinning lagging or unresponsive really annoying when trying to play games it does this when the battery is getting low too not fan it works sometimes flat on my desktop but then it slowly gets worse and worse as the night goes on and now it won even read on my mousepad at all it has to be on the desktop to make it work even poorly 
1,i really wasnt expecting this to sound and be as good as it is can literally hear the speaker from outside my house while the bass is the main star of the show it leaves me little disappointed that the treble and other minor but important rythms get drowned out lot of the time it could also be the music play so cant fault it too much overall really glad got what paid for and bit more as well
0,these are not xbox compatible aux and usb jack only 
1,my child loves this headset
0,worked great for about weeks then died never to be used again 
1,i love the colors of the led lights and it works great 
0,i just got this not very long ago it just stopped tracking on the page and just out right quit it is piece of junk to me and would never buy this again am not happy and wasted my money on this 
1,great sound quality
1,recently ve started using my gaming rig for work in cad and other programs so wireless keyboard was necessary obviously rgb adds xp points to every key stroke so this one really caught my eye it is so well built the materials used and battery life are phenomenal purchased mouse keyboard combo here in the amazon before and it was honestly crap within the first minutes the and key would randomly start typing and the right shift key did not work out of the box but this one the klim keyboard is an awesome budget solution take the time to read the material in the box it clearly an awesome company that has put alot of effort into their product very very satisfied im sucker for stickers and they really load you up great experience highly recommend 
1,easy to set up like that it is rechargeable and don need batteries 
1,works great
1,this mouse saves ton in cost of batteries because it is rechargeable it fits the palm of my hand very comfortably well worth the cost 
1,good sound quality and comfortable to wear multiple options for connectivity accommodation and nice look 
0,only negative it does not have mic
1,i was stunned by the quality of this great wireless mouse with charging port it never needs battery since it is built in ve used the mouse for months and without recharging it goes and goes winner 
0,i bought this because it was rechargeable and for the ergonomic design after using it for awhile plugged it in charged it worked for awhile then it would only work for few hours then not at all when plugged it in noticed that had to move the connection where it plugs into the device to the left then it would light up but if let go nothing would not recommend this product 
1,really cool wireless mouse especially love the perfect ergonomic size and design and the cool lights 
1,i thought it was fantastic at first wirked great for me at work now the wheel keeps popping out of place and doesnt work 
1,i love it the colors make me happy it so comfortable to use

1,use it for streaming love it
1,great
1,these work great very happy with them for the price 
0,this is almost decent keyboard unfortunately some keys are in very unusual positions for example single apostrophe should be directly left of enter key and backslash should be directly above it this may not be important for casuals but this is anathema for coders didn use it long enough to test battery life 
0,sad that you can get anything from china that works for more than month these days it getting to be ridiculous at this point bought these for my kid and like clockwork they broke precisely after the day warranty was up no sound output at all maybe just have horrible luck but it seems like if it says made in china on it and you use it with any type of regularity it gonna take dump prematurely these things aren work not to mention that it huge ordeal if you want the lights to work and you re playing on console avoid these turds at all cost ve heard that the company is impossible to get ahold of anyways so not going to waste my time 
0,loved the mouse and was using it regularly for months just recently the scrolling wheel completely stopped working all of the other functions work but the scrolling feature is must for me 
0,usb adapter doesn work and light on mouse fuzzes out when plugged into different computer that allows for usb 
1,my son uses it for gaming and listening to videos while he does his school work on laptop great quality will by more for my nieces and nephews 
0, there are few good things about this keyboard lights number keys wireless rechargeable but the space bar is major deal breaker for me was looking for quiet keyboard to take notes during videoconferencing the space bar is annoyingly loud even when typing without having to be quiet on conference call it is very annoying my partner down the hall can here me typing good features on this keyboard but really cannot stand the space bar it an instant return for me the worst part is they market this as quiet keyboard it far from quiet 
0,not the best
0,i cant believe how amazing and loud this speaker is we use it outside on our pool deck and the music carries incredibly far and its not even turned up all the way
0,they are not some high falootin fancy headphones with surround sound but the work sound good with no echo and steady bass treble and they were cheap 
1,awesome product
1,great sound quality 
1,love this mouse purchased the mint green for laptop works great so far dongle was tight to remove but that ok lights change color make sure to put it on the setting that looks like sun otherwise on position will leave lights on red it was delivered when it was expected 
0,when received this item it was thin which is okay but it was also chipped off on the left side then simple drop and the mouse damn near shattered and to stop it off sometimes the cursor goes everywhere which can be annoying when you re working on particular items love it for the lights and how compact it is handle this item with care 
1,love it so far no problems love the way it looks and feels highly recommend 
0,wish the battery lasted longer seem to have to recharge it every month vs rechargeable batteries last me months before need to recharge otherwise nice ergonomic shape and low enough to not affect the wrist the optical sensor is not so great especially when battery is low 
1,have not had this too long and ve charged it and it won turn on anymore made sure switch is off even changed chargers it stopped working 
1,this product is marketed on amazon as being compatible with ps but the usb it uses is incompatible with the console due to gimmicky aesthetic design choices that make it too large to fit past the playstations protruding faceplate 
0,once received this product am very satisifed with how it looks and how light it felt it is also very convenient considering it is rechargeable with no batteries needed highly recommend this product 
0, bought this mouse as backup to keep in my laptop bag and foolishly didn try to use it until the return window had already passed it has never worked threw away my money ve tried syncing this mouse to multiple computers and devices with the same results nothing can find any info about the switch on the bottom or how to troubleshoot but when plug the mouse in to charge it it illuminates blue when actually try to use it it blinks red and shuts off it has never worked please don waste your money please learn from my mistake 
1,really got sound quality switched my audio to the head set and really thought it was still playing on my tv brought one of each color for me and my nephews wish you didn have to pug in the usb to get it to light but otherwise positive thoughts
0, no stuffing in the box to keep the product for bouncing around in the box which came with dents all in it which can cause the product to become damaged in transit it seems like an issue they could easily address it advertised sound quality that it could not deliver on the sound quality is terribly poor it sounded like was listening to the tv instead of headset even though the sound was coming from the headset this is with the volume on the headset turned all the way up it was advertised as headset that can be used with gaming consoles you need usb for the lights but the chord for that is splits from the aux input and the chord is only inches after the split meaning if you re using controller your not able to enjoy the full experience of the headset because you would need to be have the controller inches from the usb source not to mention the lights aren as bright as advertised in the pictures it advertising noise isolating mic personal testing found this to be false not only could hear the video was listening to on youtube but could hear my air conditioning in the background not what would call noise isolation some people said the headset was too small found it to be too big in my experience either that or they are just too loose because of the padding quality on the ears can shake my head slightly and it ll fall right off when game like to immerse myself in the game which might mean small quick movements and leaning side to side that would cause the headset to fall off your head watch video for demonstration speaking of the padding on the ears that might be what causes this headset to not be noise cancelling my jbl ear buds have more noise cancelling capabilities than this headset does could still hear when someone opened the front door to my building while playing my game will be returning these and requesting refund 
0,the sound is phenomenal if you pair with another you practically have stereothis is just as good as the bose speaker bluetooth speaker these can stand toe to toe with them 
1,i have it for my personal computer and it has worked out great
0,only downside to this keyboard is that the enter key is too damn small keep on pressing but other then that keyboard is fine
0,it is somehow ok
1,i absolutely love this mouse it well built and has so many features that similarly priced mice don have it so whisper quiet and smooth as can be it also rechargable which helps out ton 
1,great speaker as always from jbl have bought jbl speakers this year alone and can get enough of them this speaker is perfect for any occasion great sound that fills up the room ve had other more expensive bluetooth speakers and jbl always blows them out of the water 
1,my son loves the headset 
1,looks feels great love all the colors 
1,this little wireless mouse is awesome the color at night looks amazing love the handle my wife liked it as well that had to buy her one as well thanks for the amazing product
1,my husband has been wanting speaker like this for while this was deal of day so jumped on it he is so happy with this speaker thanks for great deal and extremely fast shipping 
1,it sounds great
1,great for gaming sound quality is perfect
0, month update this thing squeals now it took me week to figure out why kept hearing high pitched whine every time moved my cursor and eventually realized that something inside the mouse is creating very high pitched squeal every time move it that on top of the mouse dying in about day of use now means that this thing is no go definitely buy something else this thing has been total headache since got it the battery on this mouse doesn seem to last very long time after about two days of usage it ll die find myself plugging it in every night to make sure don have to deal with that additionally the thing goes to sleep after about minute or two without movement super annoying you have to click the mouse to wake it up again and doing so registers click wherever your mouse was left on screen before it went to sleep can recommend it for any type of work that requires small periods of typing or reading you ll end up waking up the mouse from its weird sleep about million times 
1,great product 
1,i wish would have read more reviews before purchasing it is decent little speaker but it definitely has the monosound as people have described love the color 
0,office work
1,i love how the mouse changed colors and the set up was easy just plug and go the charging was easy as well
1,this gaming headset is the perfect amount of quality for the price you get the noise cancellation is great and the sound quality is not bad at all bought them as gift and the reciever was incredibly happy to be on the other end using these extremely happy with the product will recommend 
1,it was working fine until one day it would not connect to my computer reached out to support and they were able to send me new one without question they provided the perfect support in the time frame needed 
1,i mainly use it for work zoom meetings it starts to hurt my ears after several hours or more hours but for the most part it comfortable highly recommend it 
0,bluetooth keyboard
0,great sound and very lite but days to somewhat fully charge and this is the second one ve had jbl needs to think what kind of batteries they are using 
0,left it on overnight and then tried to charge it up for work now it doesn work
1,great sounds bluetooth connectivity is soo easy
0,i didnt like the dim features im using razer keyboard now and its alot brighter than this aloso hated the feature where it would turn off after few seconds interferred big time with my gaming and cant see where this can be gaming keyboard as such games as skyrim and fallout require you to make last minute decisions as for regular keyboard for regular things its good but gaming naw its waste of money sorry guys its flop 
0,i bought these headphones for my nephew he says that he likes the sound the material seems sturdy enough they are confortable and can be use with any device 
1,comfortable fit
1,perfect
0,broke with barely any use the mic stopped working literally the same week bought it
1,pros the physical design of the keyboard is great feedback on the keys is good has nice matte finish lights are as advertised and there are holes on the back of the keyboard which helps keep the keys clean and if you spill liquid on it it can drain cons couple times days the keyboard will disconnect intermittently on me it will become unresponsive and disconnect then reconnect rapidly its not for very long maybe seconds to couple minutes and if at the computer for hours day it will only happen couple times but if in the middle of game it can be quite frustrating never have had this issue with other wireless keyboards not sure what the solution is but tried reinstalling the driver 
0,i have weird situation with my speaker everything works fine except that it doesnt allow me to turn it off whenever you try to turn it off it goes off for some sec and turns on by itself have try several troubleshooting steps and still the same

1,very comfortable and feels great
0,the product fits well in my hand and has quiet click but it keeps on cutting out will walk away for minute and the mouse does not work anymore so have to unplug it turn it off then back on and replug it in 
0,bought in january it april and it won charge so it useless 
1,super easy to use just plug in to do the initial charge and then recharge via the usb cord as needed kinda fun to have the light display change colors throughout the day soft touch when you right or left click and barely makes any clicking noise 
1,so have kids and they all homeschool don have an office but do both work and school myself at home with the kids all around me these seem to get everything done was hoping for they are quiet enough inside to ignore the kids when needed the mic does cancel out the computer games being played right next to me while on skype call on amazon it did specifically say it did not come with mm audio adapter for slitting the mic and headphone jack locations but mine did show up with set so the ones ordered in addition are no longer needed find them comfortable they were an easy plug and play type set up the only thing that can specifically comment on one way or another is longevity as have only gotten them today 
1,this is great keyboard and like it however do wish there were more light effects than featured the lights are as shown in the picture they can be set to stay solid color or to strobe on and off you can adjust the brightness of the lights as well as far as the lights what you see in the description picture is exactly what you get other than the lights you are able to hold down the function key and press other keys to control the volume of your computer and play skip forward skip backward and stop play buttons theres couple other hotkeys you can use but are useless to myself and likely everyone else under the age of 
0,it works well functionality wise for me but the lights don work it just stays red and the light is very blinky jittery
0,basic mouse at reasonable price 
1,purchased this for my son and it has been great to take some noise down and gives him better sound 
1,product worked great for st months now the usb charging port is bad and since it rechargable mouse it useless now led lights were cool and the mouse felt great ergonomically with soft quiet clicks being optical vs laser it isn for gaming and battery wouldn last all day clicking it also went into sleep mode too quickly and having to click without knowing where the arrow to turn it on turned into hassle

1,they worked great for two months then the mic went out boo 
1,these are very good quality set for the sub the only thing that could be better is the max volume could be higher but they are still very good other than that am very pleased and would purchase this product again in the future

0,more technical trash
0,it is so pretty the lights are gorgeous love that it is rechargeable but the roller in the middle broke and haven even had it for months use it for work so it doesn get lot of use either 
1,feels nice works well looks good
1,it is really what needed it is wireless so no more wires around my busy desktop love the background lights which makes it little different from boring black keyboards and also since it is my second keyboard for my second computer in the same desktop so really needed it to be colored differently was initially concerned about battery life but have only charged it once so far and that was more than weeks ago didn use it heavily but thought it will last max for week nice like it very much and suggest it to others 
0,good and simple to use
0,good quality
0,it lit
1,i ve had mine for years now and the outer skin on the earmuffs is now peeling off they still sound great for how much they cost but told the mic doesn sound very good ve since switched to another mic but still use this headset and will continue to do so until the earmuffs completely fall apart 
0,everything is precisely as advertised which is what needed for working from home this keyboard was purchased to help keep me from slouching over my laptop key which is smaller and doesn tilt up
1,good keyboard just make sure you do not loose that charger or you will have hard time charging it 
1,my sister bought one last year and had to have one the sound is just beautiful definitely worth the price 
1,it great for gaming
0,ok
0,would prefer to buy bcz its cheap and nice
0,i like this keyboard it does everything want it to do and like the color scheme don think that changeable but could be wrong the only real problem ve had with the keyboard is that it will turn off with no warning that it low on battery it also has good feel to the buttons 
0,i work from home and this is great mouse overall it super slim and it lights up but it not super bright that it bothering you 
1,very comfortable to use love it
0,bought one and liked it bought another for stereo sound the second came factory refurbished no notice or mentioning on the amazon page about refurb believed was buying new not cool at least let the consumer choose weather or not to pay full price for refurb

1,overall really like the mouse but the scroll button doesn work also was not able to find way to contact the seller to resolve the issue 
1,easy to use and sounds amazing 
1,nice and smooth nice to just connect to pc to charge and not get batteries itd be cool if they had software to control the lightsit goes into standby mode super fast not negative or positive trait 
1,my son loves them for gaming no complaints from him only have to get louder so that he can hear me if he playing with them on lol 
1,i find this mouse easy to use fits my hand very well wear medium sized glove and moves fairly smoothly say fairly smooth because used mouse pad with smooth soft surface it seemed to drag just little when tried smooth hard surface it worked better you do have to click button to wake up the mouse when it goes to sleep mode my other one woke up with just moving it thought that maybe the changing lights around the mouse would be distracting but dont even notice it would probably buy again 
1,i love this mouse but hate it at the same time love it because it cute and it functions well that is if it doesn run out of battery charge during normal use the charge only lasts for about days it good that it can be recharged just didn think would be recharging it that often you can tell when it running low because it starts jumping all over the place just try to remember to charge it while charging my laptop also was under the impression that it came as usbc to charge and it does not it comes with an adapter for usb to usbc could ve just got an adapter for my old mouse had it been made clear 
0,my son was using it for his laptop for school and it stopped working didn want to work nomore 
0,on time delivery and nice quality
1,i love how smooth and easy it is to handle just can change the setting from all red to multicolor to the color want purple so mean wait for purple to come around and in happy with it it does what need needs better detail instructions
0,i barely used this keyboard as purchased it over winter break days into it and it started lagging and wouldn accept all they keys would push and lag overall big disappointment skip this and pay for better quality keyboard connectivity issues seems to be the problem cheaply made 
1,it very nice and helpful for gamin
1,this was pandemic lockdown buy my wife and were spending lot of time outside on our patio our happy hours were missing something great sounds this speaker delivers great sound at low mid and high range it can also play very loud although we keep the volume pretty low to be respectful of our neighbors would recommend this speaker to friend 
0,you can hear the xbox audio in headphones but tv sound still plays 
0,this is my fourth jbl speaker my very first one was the little to go that lasted forever ve had it for years now and my daughter still uses it my second one was charge three it lasted year and half before the battery stopped working my second charge three year and half as well battery stopped working now just ordered charge four ve had it for little over week now and it glitches it staticky and it horrible don will ever buy another jbl am very disappointed with the charge edit ve had it couple weeks and the battery only stays charged for day do not waste your money

0,i wish the charger was longer it so short used it once and the mouse was not calibrated had to bang it couple of times then it worked buying new one do not recommend this product 
1,work great specially cause have big head so definitely recommend conforms fits and doesn irritate 
0,product is fine but it super limited to what it can do you are stuck with the rainbow colors for the lights which is not what the description sounds like so would say this is nearly false advertisement based off of wording but it probably translated through levels of google translate so who knows obviously is membrane keyboard and it very squishy the lighting isn bad and the only gamer thing about this is the rgb you can control would have rather had completely red one am going to find another keyboard and return this one for its lack of functionality 
0,so far is working still havent test waterproof qualities
0,this mouse last me like month or two im not able to scroll up using this mouse will not buy again

0,so bad quality and uncomfortable
0,thank you
0,my husband bought of these in different colors for our children for school last month yesterday was the first day for our youngest the mouse did great no problem the second was dead since our daughter likes colors so we placed it on the charger last night and it still charging unplugged the mouse to see if it had any any charge no charge at all so now have to explain to my yr old that the company gave her broken mouse and try to find way to to get it work with her device while always charging should of just went to target 
1,just wasn what wanted should have read the reviews about how it always going to be different colors and it like typing on cone shaped keys worked great nicely made just not for me 
1,i glad that ordered this keyboard it been nice gaming on it 
0,battery life is not hours dies after playing at the pool for hours everyone once in while the sound cuts in and out like my phone is too far away except it will be within range recommend getting something similar at lower price point because am not satisfied also what with these companies assuming that we have extra charging blocks to plug in cords 
1, am in love with this mouse its just perfect for the price been using it lot and only need to charge it once really recommend it 
1,amazing quality that not expensive
1,great sound quality and comfortable my kid loves em 
0,audio is inconsistent and cuts out mic also sounds like garbage 
1,great product definitely serves its purpose 
1,i think this mouse is great love the led colors changing it goes to sleep after little while to save battery life it very simple to charge if it ever needs it my only thing about it and it not even negative about the device is that my hands are very big so this seems little tinier than like still though got no complaints about it 
1,so definitely stars here the sould it really good they even fit my big head issue never thought had big ears but these don fit my ears right and after bit they start to hurt slightly just take min break and potty or something and then back at it played for hrs straight the first day can fault them 
0,really underwhelmed by this and the charge not lot of clarity and bass seemed too heavy was far more impressed by the flip 
0,horrible product stopped working day we returned this microphone twice and both stopped working nd one stopped working within month the rd time we tried returning they wouldn process the refund amazon is turning into wish my little boy was so disappointed as was miss the old amazon 
0,battery last forever accidently left it on over the weekend and still didn need to charge it until tuesday it did take some getting used to the power save function you need to click to wake it up 
0,this mouse last me like month or two im not able to scroll up using this mouse will not buy again
0,cool looking mouse and dazzling light colors 
1,clicks are very smooth and responds great plus you never need batteriesjust what was looking for at reasonable price
1,this came with an adaptor to fit the apple laptop but is not made specifically for apple products the charge does not last long and needs special adaptor prefer battery operated mouse as maintaining so many different chargers on my desk is cumbersome the three settings for on off are also less than ideal in summary while this mouse is aesthetically pretty it is not functional with the apple products 
0,does not work for ps bad quality not recommend
0,my son like this for playing online games on his xbox had previous turtle headset that he loved but that had gotten damage after long use this item was confusing to use there separate usb cord plug adapter that can be plugged in if you re using it on laptop or computer that will also make the unit light up but the lights only work if the usb cord is plugged in during play sound often times would not work and microphone would intermittently cut in and out update now works better after resetting and updating controller for xbox volume and on off switchis bulky and uncomfortable returning product going to buy another turtle
0,the mouse can use but the back side of the light is broke 
0,ergonomic smooth and quiet this is the third one ve bought and ll never go back to another one charge lasts more than week and never turn mine off
1,great headset exactly as listed 
1,this mouse has been great super quiet when you click and responds well when prompted the lights add nice touch and remind you to turn it off for the day 
0,i just wanted colorful mouse and this is what expected its okay in ergonomics but do not know much about ergonomics its okay for gaming but its not the best since its more of office type mouse 
1,i originally ordered this keyboard just over years ago and was and still am very happy with the product the product is lightweight the keys feel nice and they are pretty quiet like that it has the separate number pad but the whole keyboard is not too large or bulky the rechargeable battery lasted longer than expected so was able to take advantage of the wireless feature when the battery does die you can still use the keyboard while it is plugged in and charging and the battery light on the top right corner turns off when its charged the rainbow colour lights behind the keys are nice touch too am not gamer though so have no comment on its features for that purpose just recently the battery started to die more frequently and had to plug it in more often which was not the end of the world for me as most keyboards require cords anyway however the battery eventually started to expand and the keyboard warped and became unusable went back to my amazon order and checked to see if there was warranty and there was years reached out to customer service via email with pictures of the keyboard and my original invoice they responded within the same day and offered me replacement have the replacement now and still love it the company has provided exceptional customer service they were very responsive and they stand behind their product they even checked in with me to make sure that received the replacement and that it was working as expected 
0,i don use this every day it less than two years old and already time for replacement the wire casing at the connection point is cracked and internal wires are exposed works great but should have lasted longer 
0,as ve just learned by searching questions after using it for few weeks the scroll wheel stops working also these are silly lights for grownup they remind me of those kids shoes that light up when they step green pink yellow lights are kid or gamer colors every time try to save buck regret it off to buy new one 
0,i like the size and sound output
1,easy to navigate lights add touch of fun use this as my traveling mouse with my lightweight laptop no complaints and no problems
1,these are great 
1,my sister was very happy with her present and loves the sound 
0,i had no issues with the mouse but dropped it from not even ft from the ground on accident of course and the spin wheel and the left clicker broke ve ordered another one and hope it lasts longer than this one did 
1,i bought it at for that price it is finitively good price well other speaker is th revovle plus from bose so hard to compare not the same range of price neither power but this is nice handy sound system 
0,this is probably the single most frustrating headset have ever dealt with the mm jack fits loosely in dell workstation it is not wired correctly does not work in combo headset mic jack on the same workstation the usb connection is purely to power the leds ended up replacing with cheaper headset from reputable manufacturer and all of the issues ceased 
1,i purchased this mouse because needed new one for my work from home station came across this mouse and read some of the reviews and thought would take chance on it it has turned out to be one of the best things have purchased from amazon it is such smooth operating mouse and the color displays on it are really fun definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in search of wireless mouse 
1,my mouse decided to stop working and forced me to have to get new one found this one and thought would give it try am so glad that did it sleek and stylish and love that it lights up would highly recommend this to anyone who wants sleek and fun mouse 
0,first the american flag and corporation website does not like to tell you where they make their products got the keyboard and it said made in china then proved it was made in china by the keystrokes not working demanded my money back and warn anyone to avoid china malfunctioning keyboard that pretends to be an american product not cool 
0,the mouse itself was wonderful it installed within seconds and was very smooth operating it fit well in my small hand and there was no clicking noise wish it worked out as liked the mouse itself the only issue is not the mouse itself but my sensitivity to the led optical lights got migraine from it the led light can be turned off so that in itself could be remedied but the optical light which is bright red showed through the side lights the gap between the switches and the dpi option switch there was no way of blocking the light was really sad had to return it 
1,awesome looking and good sound my boy loves them 
0,the matte coating started peeling off within week or two of using it it still works well but looks terrible 
1,i ve had this mouse for less than month and now it won work loved this mouse at the beginning never had problem with it and it was super cute now it turns on and everything and is also fully charged fyi and it won move at all on my laptop just when need it for huge work project and can use it bummer 
0,battery life seems to be decent have two of these and both have issues with the dpi randomly changing itself so have to click the button to change it numerous times day every now and then the one use at home doesn connect when turning on the computer have to unplug re plug the dongle do have it plugged into usb switch but seeing as it the only device that encounters this issue don believe the problem is the switch not likely to buy this again it been too frustrating 
1,i have bought several of these since this first one they work amazing have had no issues and recommend this seller and mouse brand alot the price is so good 
0, updated after five months of use the keyboard suddenly died for no reason tried all troubleshooting could and it just doesn turn on turns on for about half second and turns back off guess you get what you pay for doesn last long whatsoever original review had been looking for wireless gaming keyboard that wasn loud and had backlighting it not the perfect keyboard and didn expect it to with that price the two things would change in their second version would be to make the rgb bit more versatile or customizable to save little on battery and make the keys feel little more clicky because hard to feel if the key went through sometimes overall love the weight its durability and slick look knocked it for two things but they are picky at this point 
0,like it so much bought second one 
1,works perfectly colors are fun still running on the first charge but do turn it off if ll be away from the computer for long 
1,great speaker
0,no usb only type c

0,this mouse worked for day and then stopped it was very comfortable to use and silent click which was nice but it stopped working so it pointless 
1,good quality comfortable fit great sound
1,this mouse is light and fits in my hand well it fun to watch the colors slowly change however it does not stayed charged long at all and cannot be used while it is charging 
1,i used these for my xbox one so had to buy and adapter as well as some kind of power source power bank to power the led lights but other than that they re soooo cute 
0,took days to ship so much for prime next day shipping and won light up without being plugged into usb waste of time and money 
1,ordered for my grandson and it was perfect 
1,seems to work great kids love it
1,my boyfriend got me this as gift to help with my crafting love this color because it goes with my cricut also loved that it came with an adapter for my macbook air these newer macbooks require adapters for anything that is not charging port or the newer charging cords so seeing it come with an adapter is amazing don have to carry around my other adapter and its very easy to use love it thank you so much for thinking of us apple users 
0,mic doesn work and have to mess with the head jack to get both speakers to work
0,and it only wireless half the time the other half you ll have it plugged in and charging because charge doesn last very long that why they give you that little short charging wire that plugs in the front of the mouse that makes it hard to use when charging everyone knows it easier to drag chain up hill than to push it up well everyone but these people update the battery has completely gone dead it won even take charge anymore after only three months you have to keep it plugged into your laptop at all times and even then it goes dead occasionally if you use it too much or too fast you have to wait to seconds for it to charge just so you can use it for another seconds it even worse than the star rating gave it originally 
1,its nice mouse but not sure if its good for gaming 
1,works very well but wish it had option for regular battery 
1,this mouse is prettt okay it works fine and lights up pretty which is bonus not fan of the feeling of clicking though wish bought different mouse for that reason but will hold onto it for now

1,great product
1,this mouse is wonderfully priced for its diversity it works with the chromenook my boy xboxes all our phones and its comfortable and quiet
0,it died about week after returnability 
1,i have had this mouse for while now love it it perfect size and the color change is probably my favorite part don have to recharge it everyday but really only use it for work so work an hour day again it really doesn need to be charged often when it time for charge the color will start to shift to red everyone that seen it has asked where got it and that they want one 
0,i was so excited when got my mouse in to go with my laptop and it didn even work had it charge over night while it was off and still wouldn connect 
1,it works and it cheap so there that not great mouse by any means but then again it was also like so not mad
1,it pretty mouse just some notes plastic bit thin at the top so the color bleeds through more than the pic it fine just an aesthetic thing mouse wheel bit noisy now after some use squeeks and screetches some when scrolling battery life is fine glad can use it when charging sensitivity is off cursor moves quickly randomly as if its spazzing out thought this was battery issue but it happens when fully charged sometimes overall it fine but shouldve just bought something bit sturdier even if it was pricier gonna keep using it to get my moneys worth 
1,great for the price hold charge for good amount of time
1,these headphones are amazing especially for the price the cable is long and the braids make it tough the headphones itself are pretty comfortable and the sound quality is really good also really like the fact that there is switch to mute the microphone and volume controls right on the cable great gaming headset at an affordable price 
1,great headphone for the price look awesome and feel great the noise cancellation could be better but for the price can really beat it 
0,everything you would expect from jbl speaker 
1,the colors are fun and different the thing did not like was that the default color is red if it is not in rainbow mode the material is okay it works at it should it is great that its rechargeable it holds charge for long time and if you forget to turn it off the sleep mode works well 
1,this speaker is far more that what expected own smaller veraion of it and the battery dies fast this one on the other hand is little bigger but the sound is great and the battery life omg 
0,this was used once thought was my phone will not pair with any device 
0,i do not recommend this mouse worked all of days changed the batteries and it still does not work spend your money on basic mouse that works

0,i use this mouse all day every day at my desk job and have had to charge maybe once week it never dies on me just take it upon myself keep it on the regular mouse mode as don need all of the colors flashing but have no complaints
0,cool and cheap however just know buying keyboard this cheap the battery life is not very good at all 
1,great sound quality
1,my grad daughter loves this keyboard she purchased with her grad money the price was right and shipped was fast 
1,there reason these headphones are super cheap because they are it comes with usb and mm plugs so you ve got an overabundance of wires to deal with right off the bat the mic doesn go any lower than the image shows so find myself yelling into the mic to be heard by my team and they tell me the sound quality of the mic isn that good when replace these ll spend more money on higher quality set 
0,very good
0,slim style with punch of quality sound
1,my favorite thing about this mouse is how smooth it feels to the touch the colors are great addition and add to the experience of using it it feels sleek as you move it on mousepad and all other surfaces and textures the customer service has been splendid they replaced mouse for me and helped answer questions when inquired about getting replacement usb receiver they were pleasure to communicate with no complaints
1,i bought the keyboard so could play games in the living room and it was working fine the lights were really pretty the keys felt clean and it was pretty easy to move around however less than month after bought it the backspace key key and key stopped working 
0,bought these for my sons birthday in may and gave them to him first week in june it the second week in july and the sound and microphone cut in and out this product is junk and not worth the money 
0,my brand new jbl doesn charge even once hard reset didn work getting new charging cable didn work either had it replaced for another one and faced the same problem again not worth replacing again especially given the unreliability of the battery ll probably get bose or beats 
1,great sound love my music 
0,only one side works
0,i can hear but the mic does not work may have gotten defective set 
1,the usb plug broke and the case around the chip got stuck inside the port can pull the usb out but the case stays inside the port it still useable if put it back in though it also has very high pitched dog whistle kind of noise when it moves especially when it used close to the usb plug it is not silent that for sure have to use music or headphones when use this mouse or it drives me insane it shallow depth is kind of hard on my hand but have arthritis so usually need thicker taller mouse to fill my palm to be comfortable but bought this mouse as backup for my work laptop so don use it as much as use my gaming mouse like that you can still use it when it plugged in to charge if you use longer cable 
0,works well with windows 
0,after only owning this for less than year the microphone does not work this break my son heart as playing fortnite without mic is really devastating 
0,it not very responsive but it does work the lights are terrible but it does light up as far as adjusting the dpi did not see difference at all would not recommend for gaming but if you wanna surf the web on smart tv its works well 
1,we like it sounds great
1,this mouse is very useful and beautiful colors thought it wouldn fit my mac but it came with mac adapter very convenient and cute too 
1,it jus dies really quick but mabye that cuz leave it on and walk away cuz when done using it like to walk back into my room with it still on but otherwise love it
1,well had to prep them to handle floating ground output amplifier these headfones are almost knocking my eardrums out of my nose with precise and powerful sound delivery 
1,maintains the charge for long period don miss batteries nice size and easy use 
1,i love this 
0,stopped working in less than week just up and died and now it has to be returned and look for another one save yourself the effort and keep on lookin this ain it 
1,the keyboard remains responsive and in perfect working order after month of regular use do have fancy logitech gaming keyboard with all the bells and whistles but prefer the quiet keys of the klim quiet doesn mean unresponsive in this case the keys feels sturdy and satisfying love that it uses usb for charging or wired gaming and the battery life is surprisingly long 
1,it is great headset for the price the sound is great and my voice is not to messed up with the mic lol the only reason this is not five star is because the ps settings are not playing nicely with the headset on pc they work great though 
0,i got my jbl charge and it worked well until the battery died and then it would not let me charge do not buy 
0,of course didn expect high quality product for this low price but man the mouse didn even last week it dead charged it just one time and dead it could have worked at least half year just can believe that amazon let sellers like this run business on their platform 
1,i purchased these for my nephew and they are absolutely amazing great headphones for gaming will definitely order another for myself 
0,i mean come on do you even have qa team did anyone try and use this thing can use ctrl shift together useless garbage how did this thing get such high rating beyond disappointed 
0,i can hear sound coming from them but the mic stopped working after the second day of use and can get it to work now 
1,i love my new jbl speakers the sound is very clear and you can connect more than one at time that is great improvement over the older speakers wish could trade my older ones in for these new ones 
1,these are impressive headphones for the price and the mic works great everything is crystal clear
0,mouse only worked half the time then never held charge 
1,amazing little mouse
0,i ve only had the headset for months and already getting static when trying to talk to my friends on xbox also not sure who to contact to see about replacement the headset sat on mount out of the way and wasn impacted by anything out of the ordinary 
1,initially had an issue with the battery but the seller reached out and corrected quickly appreciate the support 
0,nice mouse for few months of light use after that it would not take charge even tried swapping cables big disappointment
1,was gift very happy with it 
1,i had high expectations for the jbl charge because it has lot of competition and gets good reviews it not exactly cheap either this implies that the charge should be optimistically almost as good as bose for example unfortunately not call me sonically spoiled use yamaha hs and hs monitors on isolation stands at home my truck has bose system that delivers bass mids and highs like reference system ve heard plenty of bose bluetooth speakers and they ve sounded good used to hearing everything crisp and clear having said all of that many people will hear this speaker and be blown away by the quality it not terrible and it actually sounds good in stereo with two connected together unfortunately it not that simple stereo mode is very unreliable and wonky with single charge the highs and mids sound pretty unappealing the best word can think of to describe its overall sound is flat and sloppy with punchy bass the sound stage is disappointingly one dimensional unless you buy second one and use jbl jbl connect app to run them in stereo stereo mode gives these charge an instant drastic improvement in sound but my speakers switch out of stereo mode and into party mode dual mono every time switch between apps and sometimes just from hitting pause for second this should have never made it past qa at jbl didn know that was happening at first but did notice that things went from sounding great to sounding terrible even with two connected that party mode it two copies of the same sounds right on top of each other don want that want left and right speakers that work reliably stereo mode gives wide stereo image and somehow balances out the lone charge inadequacies bit but can even count on it to work properly to summarize think the charge has potential to make good quality bluetooth audio solution but only if you plan on buying two and only if jbl improves stereo mode functionality right away the app should remember which mode the speakers were on and keep it that way or let us choose default mode either would help tremendously 
1,great sound quality
0,i just received this yesterday and am planning to return it seems very cheaply made product not taking the chance 
1,use for desktop computer works great 
1,impressive sound and quality slightly bulky to cart around but otherwise works wonderfully can pair with other compatible jbl speakers for even louder experience 
1,it very confortable when wearing over your ears the noise canceling is effective and it plugs into my computer easily 
1,for only few dollars over this works great and the sound is very good 
0,i purchased this as an admittedly cheap headset just have something to use until could afford better one and within weeks of owning it the headset stopped working would not be detected at all by any of my pcs had amazon replace it with another one and that nd one failed the exact same way less than hours later unreal would advise anyone looking for headset to look elsewhere terrible cheap awful product 
0,i got to use it for one day better to get one from walmart 
0,the usb port broke inside my work laptop after only using this wireless mouse for days there was nothing that happened that would have should have caused the usb to break other than it being poorly made am very disappointed with the outcome 
1,it worked great liked the low profile however it started to act up few days before and then stopped working after months tried it on two laptops with the same results 
0,these are horrible if you are gamer these are not for you invest in better
1,very nice comfortable and work as expected 
0,has not even been two weeks and it stopped working have it charging it ll light up blue then it turns off within minute
1,ease of installing and very super cool looking at my laptop 
1,paid for the razer blackshark gaming headset months ago and the mic doesn work most of the time specifically while playing fortnite on ps paid for this bengoo stereo gaming headset and the speakers and mic sound and work fantastic don pay more 
1,my father has one jbl just like this one that love and that why bought guess wasn lucky with my jbl because it won charge am waiting for the seller to contact me still want jbl but one that works
1,love how the colors light up when using it 
1,product is real great have big ears and it fits over my ears real well volume adjustment wheel move easily would recommend 
1,got this on sale great value
1,ok so there is nothing wrong with this keyboard but nowhere in the description did it say that it had matte finish the keys have slightly sandpaper feel to them that just cannot handle as highly sensory sensitive person every time touch key it is like nails on chalkboard it was great price so decided to use it as keyboard for my tv used very infrequently instead of my primary computer keyboard rather than return it am now shopping for an alternative primary keyboard to use 
0,you are not going to find better headset for the money can hear someone sneaking up on my on cod but can hear my wife talking to me from the kitchen 
0,as lot of other reviewers said the scroll wheel broke have had different usb mouse for years without this problem ll be going back to it the battery life is also very short constantly having to recharge it 
1,perfect for listening to tunes while doing dishes or hanging out in the backyard 
1,love my new keyboard 
0,i not buying batteries 
1,well the color is great but it stopped working after two uses tryed to charge it and it doesn even take charge won try anything from this vendor again 
1,our kids love it they can play each other in game on our ps and ps game systems they also love it for their kindles and school devices 
0,i bought this mouse and the thing barely moves across the screen not traction it very cheaply made would not recommend at all needed one fast cause my old one is going ve had for years this mouse will not last four years 
0,sounds terrible low not volume
1,i gave it four star rating only because we realized that to use it for the xbox one you can have the lights on at the same time for talking because the plugs for the lights has to be plugged into the xbox it self but to talk the plug has to be plugged into the controller and the cords split off of each other so it not long enough other than that it works great and my son loves it
0,mouse is too small for my hands
1,awesome speaker
1,overall great product at great price 
1,i have charge and flip we have taken these everywhere know the charge has been thrown tossed and dropped the throw slightly opened the case but it snapped right back together and sounds as good as when we got it love these things great sound and great battery life 
1,shipment time was good product is as listed couldn be happier 
0,it was present
0,it half works have to charge it ton and leave it off if not using it it also goes to sleep quick and takes forever to wake up not sure if would order from them again 
1,feels and sounds better then expected like the mic switch for faster responses would buy again 
1,i use this for everyday use mainly for the wireless capabilities since working remotely from lately this fits my needs perfectly definitely recommend 
0,everything is great but the back space is sticky key sometimes it works sometimes it doesn 
1,i have the jbl charge and now this and it works great perfect for use in out of our camper 
0,the mouse is fine for typical home use but the dongle drives me crazy remove it from my laptop when it not in use and put it back under the mouse its pretty difficult to remove it again without some kind of sharp edge feel like it will eventually break 
1,if you want cheap light up mouse then get this one when it on sale definitely not worth the price otherwise it very quiet and slim but that about where the benefits outweigh the cost the actual lighting is not what advertised it actually pretty dim even in dark room beyond that whenever you move the mouse the red laser at the bottom for tracking movement lights up the whole mouse taking over the other colors being displayed additionally with the hour charge time and the usb needed for connectivity you be better off buying nicer mouse for the same price
1,great mouse very fast and smooth was skeptical at the price being so cheap but wow fantastic item would definitely buy again in fact am getting second one for my son for school 
0,i own two charge speakers that are still working well with my android phone many years later bought this charge for my mother who has just recently started using an iphone 
0,i have now purchased of these computer mice both of which have broken and become unusable within just few weeks with the first one thought got defective item so returned it and got the same model again for exchange now that one has broken too conveniently just days outside the return window in both instances the click wheel stopped functioning making scrolling impossible these were handled with care in my home office and not used improperly or dropped or exposed to moisture etc they just seem very cheaply made the led lights were nice feature but meaningless without functioning mouse as far as the ergonomics often found my hand hurting the mouse is so low profile as to be unnatural to hold or maneuver do not recommend this product 
1,it is nice easy to use love it 
1,awesome little speaker for traveling or hanging out by the pool
1,i have not had this mouse for little over days love the feel of the mouse and how sleek it is however no matter how much charge the mouse it stops responding after about minutes of use have found myself removing the dongle from my laptop several times day just to make the mouse respond bought the mouse to improve my work functionality to no avail 
0,scroll wheel broke weeks into having it and stopped working not even months later 
0,didn even work sensitivity way to fast
0,doesn work on the white surface white desk 
0,i like the slim design and color 
1,christmas give for grandson fantastic sound for its size easy to use very portable use just about anywhere much better than the boomboxes of my youth 
1,this product is very cheaply made purchased this mouse because my daughter liked the lighting on the side of the mouse however the wheel that controls how you scroll up and down on web page easily breaks off and you have to return it or buy another one buyer beware take it from father who has went through of them 
0,i just brought this mouse for my laptop game cheaper and function enough for me good buy 
1,really great sound quality fits nicely on my head and the mic works good great noise cancelation great for playing fps games
1,it wasn until my husband gave me his mouse to play my sims with that realized how much loved using one even on laptop he said could have his red and black one but lo and behold when opened up amazon and put in wireless mouse found my own type of dream mouse got the mint green colored one and honestly obsessed with the glowing of the different colors great mouse great price wish needed more than one to be honest 
1,easy to use only took couple hours to first charge looks cute 
0,it nice keyboard
1,worked good for week cheap and doesn work anymore tried to change battery but can open it and if it opens can figure it out order something else not this one did love the light on it 
1,i love how loud it is how it adjustable for your ears it bigger than what use to you can say it was great upgrade 
0,it is used for gaming cushion inside the ear could be improved 
0,why does this always happen with bluetooth speakers ve tried multiple power sources computer computer charger wall and several usb cables no charge can even factory reset bought paper weight furious 
0,had an older jbl portable speaker the charge is way more expensive and larger than my old one but not any louder was disappointed in that 
1,love
0,works well
0,because can purchase an expensive one purchase the jbl charger don regret it love everything about it 
0,the scroller broke after weeks of intermittent use approximately hours per day days per week 
0,broke after one month went to plug it in and the charging port pushed way back inside the mouse and when opened the mouse up to fix it the piece had busted off completely 
0,very lightweight and like the looks of it but the right click button stopped working after few months
0,this is my second charge speaker they have nice sound portable and water resistant 
0,not very comfy and always disconnected
1,this unit pumps out enough base to fill my patio or job site the battery lasts forever charges quickly enough and sound quality is solid the sound is bit on the warm side but easily adjusted with my phone equalizer will definitely be getting another if it ever dies we have dropped this thing and left it outside few times more than should admit but it just keeps on performing it is awesome 
0,much better sound than phone listening to tunes while golfing
1,very good service good quality 
0,i almost didn submit this review because they re forcing me to type something 
1,amazing keyboard use it everyday and holds great charge
1,it is very nice keyboard the feel is soft yet mechanical battery charge time seems sufficient and the rgb is perfect brightness and at did not expect any color brightness control so that is sufficient in my eyes as well it needs better feeling charging port it does not feel like it connects or goes in all the way the cord is severe charging restriction in other words if you use it to charge phone the phone will charge in slow charge mode but maybe it is on purpose to keep the batteries from overheating suggest making sure to use only that cord for it the keys are little squishy for extended use but over time and use suspect that will wear away and leave light feeling touch which will be decent for gaming and typing 
1,nun but good vibes 
0,haven had it year and have barely used it and it already stopped working right the mouse just goes all over the place on the screen and not where you try to put it 
0,i have now purchased of these computer mice both of which have broken and become unusable within just few weeks with the first one thought got defective item so returned it and got the same model again for exchange now that one has broken too conveniently just days outside the return window in both instances the click wheel stopped functioning making scrolling impossible these were handled with care in my home office and not used improperly or dropped or exposed to moisture etc they just seem very cheaply made the led lights were nice feature but meaningless without functioning mouse as far as the ergonomics often found my hand hurting the mouse is so low profile as to be unnatural to hold or maneuver do not recommend this product 
1,great headphones very comfortable but bit heavy overall very satisfied
0,the roller stopped working
1,jbl speakers have been great this is my third 
0,keys have very smooth travel
0,feels very cheap and performs cheap too both sides stick together when wanting to use just the left side button but they both go down and pop wen going back up difficult to click on just single item 
0,it light and works for long time on battery power but the keyboard lighting leaves much to be desired
0,these things stop working after few weeks got two and one it just refuses to charge or stay on the other the scroller fell very poorly made do not purchase 
1,amazing sound quality and pretty making handling and experience awesome
1,i am not using it for gaming but think its cute and love the colors just wish it was little bighter 
1,this mouse has been the best one that have ever used would purchase this again the fun part of the multi colors is another reason to purchase it again
1,this keyboard has nice look and feel at my eyes aren what they used to be and this makes life lot easier the back lighting is adjustable spend lot of time printing photo for the grand kids 
0,battery lasted less than minutes after charging for hours connected to my laptop just fine 
0,it broke in week
1,i received this on friday and let it charge all day saturday loved how it looked the lights were fun it was however very flat and small started using it on monday it was amazing so quiet so pretty here it is wednesday the lights no longer work and it is already dead yes did power off every night much rather use battery operated mouse 
1,this headset works well it decent quality the sound is good they definitely aren noise canceling but that doesn bother me overall glad bought this 
0,did not work with my older dell computer
0,scroll wheel broke after one day only used for less than an hour and it no longer scrolls and isn connected in the correct position anymore very light use hopefully replacement will be better quality if remember ll update review after using replacement 
0,cool works 
1,cheap feeing but the ear foam is soft and nice 
0,the reason why this product has good reviews is because the seller told buyers to vote them many stars and they will get the gift as commission however they just scam buyers 
1,for gaming and even for non gaming gripe have about this headset is the volume and mic controller it like you have remote control super glued on the cord and it swings around and knocks up against your arm or chair the usb cable is also an annoying addition it cool for people who want glowing headsets but for people who don need to waste the energy for the lights it an additional cord just hanging off of your laptop or desktop so the design could definitely be better as for the noise cancellation not completely sure what noise cancelling these headsets actually have tested the mic and even with the mic all the way up you have to manually mute yourself using the volume controller otherwise people can still hear you but you will seem like you re far away from the computer the sound quality is okay played games and watched movies with these while watching shows movies with just the aux mm jack did notice some voice echoing this isn super ideal depending on what you are trying to watch or listen to but some people may enjoy this the headset does have cushy padding on the ears but it seems pretty small so for those with larger ears these might be more of on ear headphones rather than over ear ones the cushion does eventually hurt to keep the headset on for an extended period of time but hoping after wearing the cushion down bit the comfortability will increase overall the headset is okay since got it on sale it decent set of headphones

0,the keyboard initially works well and after few minutes when you type one the text does not appear and write several things and do not mark the text it is fault that affects my work regarding the colors it has two lighting modes the first is so that it never turns off and without colors on the keyboard and the second is so that it turns on and off thought the lighting was color by color will write the provider to help me with the key problem and that will depend on my qualification

1,i ordered this keyboard few months ago and absolutely love it mainly use my keyboard for school and casual gaming it charges quickly and lasts very long time the connectivity was simple and consistent and the quality was just as good if not better than my boyfriends corsair keyboard that is nearly four times the price they keyboard itself has great feel to it the keys are not too loud and it does not have that cheap hollow plastic feeling like most budget gaming keyboards do what makes this product even better is the excellent company behind it few weeks ago my dongle stopped working highly likely it was user error commute with my laptop quite bit and tend to forget to remove my dongle reached out to their incredibly friendly customer service and after some troubleshooting and confirming it was not software problem they promised to send me out new dongle once they got back in stock week or two went by and just when thought maybe was out of luck received an email from lolita informing me that since their replacement dongles were still out of stock they would be shipping me brand new keyboard had the new keyboard at my doorstep in two days just in time for my online mid term in my experience most tech companies completely forget about their customers or blow them off when it comes to little things like this already loved my klim keyboard but we are now officially klim household highly recommend buying their products 
1,love it 
0,the keypad tends to leave off some letters after prolonged use had to keep retyping some letters and in some cases it actually doubled up on the letters the charge doesn last long either all in all am somewhat satisfied with it but believe it has few inherent flaws 
0,worth the money just doensnt light up
0,size is just right for me
1,i got this keyboard because my computer is not under direct light and at night it difficult or impossible to see what you re typing can use this in the dark and it only stays lit when in use so it not glowing all day long the rainbow colors are pretty only wish it had volume button you can push fn function but would have liked just and up down mute feature somewhere 
0,the headset is as advertised

1,this mouse works perfectly for what bought it for it ergonomic chic colorful and works long time before needing to be charged it came quickly and was packaged nicely buy with confidence 
0,cool and easy to use at first but broke with in few weeks of use 
1,the microphone doesn work at all for my pc ve trouble shot the issue per their online instructions and my computers specific instructions it doesn pick the mic up at all now will say the sound quality of the head phones is great and they re super comfy but if you get them for gaming it seems like there chance that they ll do what they re supposed to 
1, works very well keep the led light shut off to save battery ve had it for about week and haven needed to charge it yet shut it off when not in use it so nice not to have cord to deal with want to buy another one love it so much the color is gorgeous

0,i thought this mouse was really cool but then it broke the scrolly wheel thing doesnt move anymore it lasted like week and its not my main computer so it didnt get used much in that week 
1,haven done many reviews but think this one was worth the time have hands that are bit larger than normal and feel the mouse fits well in my palm very silent mouse great for both office and home use without annoying those in the area haven used the mouse for gaming but also haven had any lag with the mouse as of now so could be good for that too overall if you are looking for wireless mouse good for work and home use with good connectivity highly recommend this mouse 
0,didn work no way to charge it
1,i don know about gaming but for everything else it works great 
1,quality sound easy to set up great speaker
0,the aux on the jbl charge is poorly designed the speaker will turn off between songs or podcasts if there is delay extended silence or short period of low volume section causing parts of the song to missed for few seconds while it tries to turn back on this creates interruptions if you are trying to listen to yoga or meditative music or podcasts have two of them with the latest firmware and they both have this issue it appears many others have already commented on this issue apparently this was an intentional design by jbl to save power but it defeats the purpose of the aux port the bluetooth range and party range is mediocre you can leave the room with your phone or it will cut out 
0,the scroll wheel broke after using this for like days very light use too 
1,love this mouse for my laptop glad chose this one not only is it comfortable slim and sleek in my palm but love the rotating fun colors that it emits which can also be turned off for the single color mode 
0,i love how quiet it was without hearing clicking at every move but unfortunately it started stalling freezing and just unusable in less than month 
1,great for gaming
0,stopped working in less than month such disappointing product 
0,so my review after using this mouse for months there are lot of glitches that makes the cursor on screen jump from one area to another the mouse stops working in the middle even after making sure it is fully charged you have to turn off the mouse put the mouse on charge for an hour to get the mouse to start working again will not recommend this mouse to anyone couple days later the mouse has completely stopped working and there no customer service response update the mouse is still not working have made three attempts so far to reach out to the company but they don respond the quality of customer service update it been over months since got the replacement even the replacement is horrible it stops responding the action time is delayed when you left click it doesn respond this is even after carefully keep the mouse 
1,i really enjoyed this headset when need another one this one will buy
1,this was great value and the wireless mouse works well the colors are fun too just wish it had way to keep it on one color 
1,charge is perfect someone says the issues about the mono speaker but think it has higher quality than last generation cause two speakers are two close that the stereo cannot show in accurate steps so think it good idea to buy it by the way from the usa to korea only takes days the ships are so great 
1,really good headset recommend buying

0,this keyboard looks fantastic especially with the breathing setting but the connectivitiy is garbage it makes gaming fristrating because the keybiard will lag you will put in an input and it will take few seconds to register if it registers at all there is also no indicator if it is about to die fully charged it still lags

0,good sound quality and durable

1,so far it works great hope it stays like that 
0,not bad pretty smooth operation no delays in movement connects quickly to any lap top 
1,love it great sound and good base 
1,might not be ideal for gaming because of the lag but works perfectly for of the situations one charge lasts days of very heavy usage so it convenient at the time of my purchase this was the only wireless backlit proper keyboard and still happy with the purchase 
1,keyboard is great functions as promised the follow up email was truly helpful as many of us do not read the instructions the key instructions were in the email and made the keyboard even more functional one improvement that feel would be nice being able to change the color of the lighting mainly to all one color 
1,great speaker great sound for the size cold be little louder
0,one ear would go back and forth between working and not working sometimes whole set would stop working and this was straight out of the package severely disappointed
0,completely stopped working not able to return it not worth it
1,this is perfect replacement for the stock keyboard that came with my new imac 
0,scroll wheel on off switch broke without much use it was good while it lasted but nothing too special mainly liked the shape
1,very smooth and easy to use just good all around product 
0,great sound for what it is we use it mostly by the pool and so don cart it around much but it be plenty light to take camping or to the beach charging port failed within first year even without water exposure 
0,love this but it looses its juice within hours without it being plugged in work hour shift so have to plug it in during very busy shift so need one with battery
1,great sound
1,money well spent love that the cable is thick and less likely to break and the sounds quality is top notch definitely recommend for gamers or even if you wanna listen to music and tune the world out 
0,rechargeable
0,this mouse is very light weight but not in good way it so light it actually feels cheap it takes lot of getting use to because it is so light after about three weeks the mouse started to intermittently stop working now it has fully stopped working after only month pay the more and get the microsoft one ve had that one for years and never had an issue 
0,loved this but based on other reviews not the only one with this issue stopped recharging and working after months 
0,it broke from one say to the next sad cause it was cute and very handy but the product just didn last long at all 
1,this is neat keyboard it smaller than my old wired one but that perfect it light weight and holds charge ve been using it for about week and have only charged it twice it hasn gone dead on me so not sure how long it lasts with full charge just need to make sure it doesn during gaming the lights turn off after few seconds of non use but sure that to save battery the colors are neat have lighted mouse pad that lights up with the same colors and it looks pretty cool all in all happy with this keyboard so far 
0,would not recommend at all it has not been holding charge for us at all the only way we get it to play is if we charge it fully and then leave it plugged in while it on it also cuts out very frequently and we have my phone sometimes sitting right next to the speaker the sounds quality when it works is good but that only maybe of the time 
1,awesome good quality and fast delivery 
0,i was excited for this mouse and it worked well up until now ve only had this mouse for two months already stopped working and ve only used it times don recommend buying too late to get my refund and that sucks 
0,stopped working few weeks after purchase 
0,wasn working for me only the left ear sound was coming out of tried doing return and it shipped back out but never got my refund back 
1,great mouse for travel as it is very slim and ergonomic perfect for the bag that has just enough space when you re on the go and you need to pack up and move quickly it sleep mode feature is nice adage increasing battery life and usability as far as gaming goes would recommend only lite casual games only not for gaming on the heavy side overall would buy again
1,i bought this for my son but my husband liked them so much we got him pair to he likes them more them the gaming headset he has he also likes how easy he can go from console to pc with the included adapter

0,when playing games can hear the other players but cannot talk to them that feature quit shortly after receiving the headset 
1,bought this on prime day and it does not disappoint the silent click and long charge life is great love the sleep mode and the slim feel will be buying another one 
0,the rose gold color is very pretty and the color changing effect was nice at first but after about an hour of use the colors started to glitch the back end of the mouse was staying yellow and the front continued to change colors there is an option to turn the colors off but you end up with red light that shows up randomly while moving the mouse around it will get the job done but also feels very cheap compared to logitech or name brand get what you pay for in this case 
1,love it don use it for gaming but the keyboard is excellent love the lights it has how it charges usb so that nice all around good key boardupdatei had to change my rating on this as it now just broke trade stocks and crypto so don really or use the keyboard in gaming or super high type of way like other might that use it for gaming or such but was just using it as normally to enter company tickers to search around in the morning when it just turned off on me so ok thought it was dead plugged it in no light of it charging so turn it off let it sit for couple mins so turn it back on cause just need to enter couple letter real fast so can check something it work then turns back off so switch it off again now had to do that maybe about times now the turn off on switch is not moving back to the on position nothing on the keyboard is working it never fallen always been on my desk no other moment not sure what happened here but it not working

1,it nice sleek mouse and works relatively well until it stops charging had bought it early march this year and now early may it won charge making it hunk of useless plastic buy with the expectation you will have to buy again and not very long thereafter 
1,like design not function frustrating
0,it was working great at first but now it not working ve had this mouse for about month 
1,i love this headset because it is awesome for gaming and cancels out annoying noise 
0,i ve had the speaker for about and half weeks and probably played hours of music on it went to turn it on today and noticed the music was grainy sounding and lacked bass at first thought maybe could be wrong that it didn sound as good as thought went and checked others reviews and charge issues and many people are experiencing this issue the jbl website warns about buying from unauthorized dealers and stated that counterfeit speakers have the exact same issue experiencing however the jbl website lists amazon as an authorized dealer which is where got my charge so guess have an authentic speaker that now has turned into piece of trash after barely any use

1,i do like how they light up but they add nothing to sound quality the sound quality seems good will update in few months on how they are holding up 
1,the fact that it has quiet mechanism no sound whatsoever during clicking was great but even though only used it for my desktop computer at work days week it is not working right now did not carry it around or used it for more than hour during each day basically because use my laptop most of time months is pretty premature time frame to not function

1,just got this last night for my new acer when plugged in the mouse the curser just jumps around with usb or usb plug it zig zags across the screen when trying to move in straight line it stops just short of moving to the edges of the screen and you have to move it gently to get it to go anywhere with precision charged it overnight and same results this morning adjusted the dpi with the button and it just jumps faster around the screen tried troubleshooting but can use any other mouse in my house and they work just fine so will be returning this mouse and purchasing something that works 
1,it good size for the work it does great price
0,good quality headset
1,really great to connect well sounds great
1,i have been using the wireless mouse for weeks waited to write the review so could truly review it based on my experience it has not disappointed me and like everything about it charge it whenever remember to the design is sleek and the changing colors are soothing when take my eyes off the screen stare at the mouse the respond to clicks is smooth and quick can feel the clicks but not hear the clicks 
1,great
0,the cursor acts erratically and the left and right buttons respond poorly one must work twice as hard to use this than any other mouse have ever had seek elsewhere go to local store where you can easily return the thing if you need to 
1,i am pleasantly pleased with this mouse it attractive looking and works very well it comes with usb adapter along with the charging cable in case you need one plug and play actually worked no complaints about this mouse and would purchase again if need an additional one

1,this is for young kids don buy as an adult piece of garbage so quiet can hear anything and built poorly definitely budget headset ve bought better headsets from below for bucks 
0,i would not recommend this item bought this for my daughter for school it quit working after two weeks was going to buy another one but decided to wait to see how this one would work so glad didn buy another one when put it on the charger it does not work would not recommend this item at all if you buy it you re wasting your money we liked it because the light so tried to put it onto another charger and it did not work either so don know what the problem is would not recommend this do not buy it here an update keep receiving emails from the seller wanted me to change my review don think that how it should work because the item did not work they want me to change my review to good review or they want me to delete it and pay me money for it so now this is the second email have received the first email they wanted to pay me the second email they want to pay me when you buy something online your post to do review of your item so do not recommend this item
0,this keyboards look nice and lighted up from the outside but when it comes to using it it is very unreliable and will stop working on you unexpectedly bought this back in early decemebr soon got it it was not connecting to my laptops made sure keyboard was fully charged and ready to go and tested it on two different laptops and nothing reached out to their it customer service and said the dongle has stopped working and would send me another one in days had to wait days for replacement mind you am working from home and really giving this keyboard chance dongle came followed the intructions and reset the keyboard and it worked this was by end of december its february and it stopped working today so far it lasted little over month before having the same issue all over again this is huge waste of time especially when having to work from home and having to stop and try to reset and test with multiple computers and still nothing this time it can be the dongle when inserted it reads int he computer do not recommend 
0,although there is large american flag pictured on the product description this keyboard is made in china nowhere in the description does it say that paid premium for this keyboard for it to be made in the us and this is just false advertising 
1, love it plug in and go works on my work computer with no problem will purchase from them again
1,it great the only reason didn give stars is because the lights go off almost as soon as you stop typing understand that it has an energy saver to keep you from constantly recharging it but seconds would have been perfect you barely can enjoy the effects as far as being loud it not loud to me don what kind of silent vortex these other people need to be in but it quiet enough keyboard 
1,great value my grandson love it
1,i got new macbook air and wanted wireless mouse to go with it found this one and liked the color changing lights so bought it and received it quicker than expected and am enjoying it it has rechargeable battery so no changing batteries which also like plugged it in and it worked immediately the only thing would change at this point is the connector the usb connector is standard but it has to be plugged into another connector to use it with the usb connector which is all the new macbook has and it sticks out an inch and half overall am pleased with the mouse and its lights and it works as expected 
1,bought these for my daughter for her gaming computer and she is absolutely in love with them they don hurt her ears and they work great

1,great product
1,i really like it it good is the first time you pay for something that is doing the job 
0,the keys are very soft when hitting which makes for nice feel to keyboard like that the sleep mode kicks in after minute or so of no use translating to longer battery life before having to plug in and charge the color does only stay at one spot it doesn breathe or anything will update in couple of weeks if needed 
0,it didn sync with my laptop 
0,hurts ears and overall sound is not loud
1,it ergonomic and stylish very cute colors and cool lights comes with all the attachments like cords for charging and it has small indent under the mouse to keep the part that plugs into your laptop forever losing mine so that great feature very quiet as well recommend it for nice cheap little mouse

1,theee perfect headset for gaming 
0,so my review after using this mouse for months there are lot of glitches that makes the cursor on screen jump from one area to another the mouse stops working in the middle even after making sure it is fully charged you have to turn off the mouse put the mouse on charge for an hour to get the mouse to start working again will not recommend this mouse to anyone couple days later the mouse has completely stopped working and there no customer service response update the mouse is still not working have made three attempts so far to reach out to the company but they don respond the quality of customer service update it been over months since got the replacement even the replacement is horrible it stops responding the action time is delayed when you left click it doesn respond this is even after carefully keep the mouse 
1,it is lite weight works well so far but only have it for week will post back in month have been using it for about weeks need to charge it every days that is bit faster then would like the reason dropped this from five stars to fours stars is it dies boom good then bad when it needs the charge don like to be surprised by working keyboard then dead one without warning when it works like it like the feel and find it nice for blogging but could be writing here then dead almost instantly this means have to keep track of when to charge it have to work bit extra to not get caught off guard will come back and review it in six months hope the battery keeps taking charge am thinking this was not my best choice use it hours day not typing constantly but still hitting the keys fairly often it is lit night to day and the charge runs down fairly quickly wish it had larger battery my fear is it will not take charge after six months use if you are going to type lot and constantly don buy this 
1,nice mouse and like that the mouse sleeps to save the battery 
1,this object is perfect almost the volume button is so sensitive that it accidently keeps turning everything down 
1,really appreciate the customer service klim provides quick responses and excellent keyboard

1,the wireless connection works great and mouse looks sleek and cool especially for the price 
0,i wasn looking for an ultra gamer keyboard with the lowest latency and most responsiveness highest keystrokes per minute possible was just looking for something could see in low lighting at night and take with me to the couch to control the tv monitor with this did the job perfectly battery seems to last about hours on my count with the setting of full lighting every keystroke would recommend 
0,a 
1,these work well and the sound quality is good they completely cover the ears and seem to be comfortable enough they rest on the pad on top of the head and would probably get tired of that with extended wear but overall they are good product at good price

0,description of this item list that it has led lights there are no lights 
1,the usb plug broke after one use plugged it into my chromebook usb port and when went to remove it the metal stayed in the laptop super disappointed was so happy with it up until that point cheaply made unfortunately the mouse itself was cute colors were nice but when it wireless the usb plug has to be good quality or it useless 
1,worked good for the first months used the mouse on security camera hard drive to review camera footage worked fine one time and after that no cursor icon appeared tried plugging it back into my desktop and still no cursor icon available it won select anything only right click works but can scroll to selection luckily my desktop is touch screen so manually opened up the drives properties and it said that all device functions are working properly clearly not being able to see cursor is an issue

0,used on mac laptop
1,my son loves it
1,i needed wireless keyboard because started using standing desk and the less wires the better chose this one because it has both bluetooth and usb connection options and wanted to be able to switch between my office computer and my personal tabtop the lights are just really nice to look at and they give me bit of cheer every time lookdown at the keyboard it also really quiet which is nice and it types nicely too love that it is easy to take off the key caps and clean the keyboard and there are little drain holes in each key section to clean out the crumbs say does anyone know what the word for all the crumbs and dust and stuff that gets stuck in your keyboard is learned it on tv once and can find it
0,i use this all the time battery life seems good
1,this mouse is super clean looking and connects fast it not only recharges within hours but it lasts long time ve been using it pretty frequently for the past week and only charged it once it still going strong love how it lights up and it can be used on mac or windows computer very light and easy to transport as well 
0, tried everything contacted the support through the website and no response since feb th after the day got the item its the th rn of feb and so waited little longer for response but nothing and so tried to connect the cord to the item again nothing and the usb as you can see in the video is connect to my computer and tried connecting it to other ports in the computer but nothing else work also tried with the charging cable to see if that would work but nothing again so am disappointed in the product
1,these worked day one and now only work once in while using our year old to play his playstation he can only get them to connect and work percent of the time we finally gave up and ordered another set from elsewhere locally these headphones look good but are very unreliable and do not work all the time the instructions are terrible and do not explain troubleshooting would stay away from them personally if know the light on them is what attracted him to them in the first place sometimes things look better than they are and this is one of them 
0,not bad
1,sound quality really good and the color got red is super vibrant love it
1,my year old autistic son loves these headphones and tried them out as well just to make sure he wasn just saying he likes them just to appease me they re comfortable and not too loud even on the nintendo switch can still hear outside moises but it does not make me regret these headphones 
0,nice product

1,i like the product like the design of product wanted good headset that did the basics

0,liked it
0,nice colorful led mouse that is still tethered to cord when in use for while
0,be sure your computer is on in order to see the lights on the white mouse was so close to returning it as my other mouse with lights was always on regardless of my computer but glad problem solved my own problem 
0,i ordered for work and for home they are great until died after months it indicated that it is charged but it does not function it might be bad switch they second died in less than months of use disposable batteries would be better for the environment than disposing of multiple rechargeable that stop working faster than battery runs out 
0, 
0,cute mouse but that about it very flimsy and poor quality feeling like that it rechargeable ve had this for few months now and it stopped working it charged clean clear of debris and on mousepad but still doesn work for more than few seconds waste of money

0,worked well for the first few weeks then broke right after return window closed 
0,it stopped working after days 
0,the microphone does not work ive tried all troubleshooting options and ive actually gotten sound by doing abunch of settings bs but the mic itself is just bad and the headset feels cheap its cheap headser im aware like the plastic and everything is just not worth it
1,i got this one to upgrade from my flip really really like it the battery lasts longer has great quality sound do notice that the speaker is clearly heard from whichever direction the front of the speaker is facing it also has fair distance in which the music can be heard even at lower volume 
1,this was perfect for my son the quality is great and the price was right 
1,i like too much loved
0,works fine but the battery dies really really fast so not good for gaming or for someone that is constantly using keyboard

0,microphone doesn work bad sound quality dont buy
0,only one side works wen your gaming straight trash 
1,i was wary of buying no name brand mouse but it turned out to be even better than expected it super sleek and looks great with the leds it also functions very well the clicks are almost silent if you ve used cheap mouse that has loud clicks you ll know what talking about haha and it very reactive use it for light gaming and it perfect haven even had to charge it yet which is amazing absolutely worth it for the price 
0,the scroll broke within hours of taking out of package can still use it to open tabs but can scroll 
1,the price is worth getting but find it kind dumb that you need to be right by your console to connect and turn on the lights but good headphones to start tho 
1,nice gamine headset for good price
0,it shame because love it but the keyboard has problems with several keys so far have verified that the keys and fail in the case of it sometimes works but not many
0,first purchase received the wrong color they switched it out no problem second mouse came and it stopped working within two three weeks because of the shipping coming from overseas the whole process just made the product less appealing disappointed it stopped working so soon 
1,it works amazing there wasn anything wrong ordered them to play the game with my little cousin and not the kind to buy headset then saw these and they came in before expected they are light got long wire and the sound is perfect 
1,great bought for child and he loves it works exactly as advertised he says their comfortable and he can hear everything like how it has the audio jack and usb usb is just for the power to the lights so he can use them on his tablet or the computer 
0,i like the sound and baterry life

0,i followed all instructions nothing happened and the mouse does not work at all nothing pops up linking the mouse to my computer
0,after months of using this mouse it just stopped working out of nowhere and it fully charged also experience the random jumping of the cursor before it left this life and went to mouse heaven would no recommend 
1,i wanted simple headset for gaming and this is perfect for me my friends can hear me clearly and can hear in game audio great would recommend this headset to anyone getting in to gaming 
0,i really appreciate the consistency of sound within the mouse it also multiple compatible
0,wheel broke inside from minimal use unable to put back on so the scrolling option no longer works 
0,pretty lights but when it sleeps you have to turn it off and wait ten seconds and turn it back on stopped working completely less than month after buying so now its light up paper weight
1,no problems for now not the most comfortable but given the price it good
0,i liked it because it works and that all needed
1,the good looks nice and feels good in your hand the bad the right click button is too sensitive constantly opening up the right click menu the pointer freezes and have to turn the mouse off and on to unfreeze it the ugly ordered silver mouse and got dark gray 
0,i love this mouse the only reason gave it star rating is because the scroll wheel is opposite when scroll forward away from me the page goes down and when scroll backwards towards me the page goes up getting used to it but rather it just be like normal mouse is there any way to fix this or does anyone else have this problem 
1,for gaming the mic works nice and connects to xbox one controller very comfortable on ears great sound quality 
0,it cool mouse the led features are nice and it pretty but hate when have to move it sporadically for good seconds before the mouse moves on the screen ve tried different mouse pads and it still happens it extremely frustrating and it happens as soon as you stop using for any period of time and go back to using it you have to left and right click numerous times before it will respond now it also makes an irritating high pitched noise when you move it 
1,love it
0,mouse worked great for few weeks then it started to have mind of its own ve charged it overnight but the cursor jumps all over the screen or does not move had to go back to wired mouse until purchase new wireless onedo not recommend this mouse 
0,headset wire way to longusb wire way to short
1,the mouse came as described with the option chose however after letting it charge for the recommended time before use it would not connect to my computer turned it off and then back on and it worked for about minutes within that minutes only showed one color the whole time it never worked again afterwards just went and bought mouse from walmart and it works like perfect even more sturdier than this one don waste your money on this 
1,this product is amazing the sound is really clear the design make you look like pro gamer this headphone is flexible and it has the cushion for your head the previous ones own are kinda rigid so it normally broke near areas bending occurs one thing not fan of is where the headphone volume controller is placed also the headphone volume controller can sometimes makes the sound off like the left side is little louder then the right side 
1,the product is just fine looks like jbl but clearly they lied about hours worth of music battery life plan on returning it and just going to big box store next time 
0,this mouse worked for while but then broke the led looked fake and crappy wouldn buy this if were but if are in budget it would do the job just be very careful with it 
1,i like this mouse the light colors constantly scroll through rainbow and aren static on just one color my office is in my bedroom and if leave the mouse on it makes great nightlight not too bright but just light enough to find my way around if wake up during the night especially love the fact that it rechargeable and that haven had to put any batteries in it since bought it several months ago the thing don like is that it has tendency to do its own thing sometimes if working on the couch and put the mouse down next to me flat and completely still not rolling backwards or moving at all the cursor on the screen will sometimes take off at diagonal stuttering its way up and across the screen at other times will be using the mouse to click and drag something or draw line and the cursor will suddenly jump to completely different part of the screen or it will hiccup and lose the hold on what was clicking and dragging or cause the line to wobble sometimes quite sharply kind of like trying to draw straight line in the car when the tire hits pothole it good little mouse and aside from the spastic glitches pleased with it but am getting tired of not having full control right when need it most may keep this one for its nightlight capabilities and shop for another rechargeable mouse to use with my computer 
0,i had high hopes due to all the positive reviews but this mouse became virtually useless after just weeks would move the mouse on the mouse pad back and forth and it would barely move on the screen every task on the computer began to take the amount of time it used to had to resort to using the trackpad on my macbook which not fan of definitely don get this mouse not worth it 
0,there is literally an extra key between the and the enter key the is before the enter key guess if was more of gamer maybe this would make sense but since want to type more this is terrible why would you change keyboard layout 
1,works great and is easy to connect to 
1,they are great
0,it was perfect until the wheel stopped working before months of use
0,while re chargeable the battery life is terrible feels cheap and does not track well tossed in in the rubbish and purchased and amazon basics mouse less expensive and far more capable alternative 
1,love jbl products this is great speaker good size nice to look at very stable nice sound output
1,i got this wireless mouse for my daughter because she was getting tired of using the old wired mouse for playing games on the pc so far her experience with it has been great the size was perfect for her average teen hand and she lefty the main avantage was the mouse was rechargable so we don have to worry about replacing the battery every so offten plus for me 
1,this is such huge upgrade from my old speakers the sound quality is sharp and the volume is loud enough that my neighbors might complain if keep this up got the red color which very happy with as well
0,i bought my mouse few months ago and it was working just fine now the scroll wheel sunk into the mouse and stopped working 
1,this very cute mouse works seemlessly and well comes with some charge so it works out of the box there are modes on off and light changing which is really nice the scroll wheel is smooth but pressing on it is bit stick all in all great buy for great price
1,great sound with bass battery last very long time 
1,works great 
1,great price they work just fine they fit well am not picky person so thought they were perfect for gaming discord etc 
1,my son loves the headset he enjoys how it works 
1,love the colors and the look runs very well also 
1,ergonomic and fits my hand well pretty when charged mine doesn hold charge well it only lasts couple hours at most 
1,i found this mouse to be too small for my hand and not large person by any means it might work for child but found that my thumb kept blocking the left button changing lighting was just distracting although might have become used to it if could actually get the left mouse button to work it is also too flat for good ergonomics hand at rest is normally more arched than this mouse allows 
0,very loud
0,broken key
1,a bunch of the lights are out so that kinda annoying could tell the box had been opened and it was probably return it not super ergonomic at least for people who would wear med large size medical gloves it does what it supposed to do but gonna get different one for my work computer and use this one for my personal computer that use maybe once month it doesn feel very good in my hand to use all day at my desk 
1,i had small technical issue with my keyboard and klim went above and beyond more than any other business that have worked with amazing company keyboard is good stuff too
