1,my little gamer liked the headsets easy on the pocketbook 
1,super comfy and cool but get disconnected easily 
0,i was looking for low profile keyboard wireless and with large enter key this keyboard fits the bill 
0,you have to press down very hard on the mouse it gets very annoying wish still had the box return it
0,they are of quality construction and withstand the constant on off very good product 
0,it stopped working after about weeks even after being fully charged 
0,the mouse does not hold charge it goes dead within hours 
1,the headset feels nice and sounds pretty good for the price my one complaint is the mic is not flexible at all and comes off as pretty quiet 
1,pros significantly cheaper backlit keys rechargeable looks good sturdycons off brand name keys feel little plasticy battery life is little light not bad just don expect it to last for weeks without charging that it ve had two now after many logitech backlit wireless keyboards and for half the price or less can safely safe that logitech the big name is absolute garbage in comparison 
0,works great sleeps and comes out of sleep easily colorfully not too bright to be distraction 
0,no quality
1,microphone did not work fo ps fortnite game but worked for everything else lights were cool and it was comfortable but can use it for what need it for 
1,this product was little disappointing to be honest for one wish had paid attention to the fact that this is not wireless second the lights don come on with mic jack which sure it wouldn make sense to but it really should have just been usb with an adaptor otherwise if you don care about lights it works fine say it better suited for pc gaming since usually there mic jack next to usb port but not for consoles its not the worst just the sound quality is kind of minimal it doesn play music too well it can get loud but then the sound gets shrill amd will induce headach truthfully wouldn buy this again 
0,i bought these about month ago they are already cutting out and fuzzy and in fact were doing so merely few days into my purchase do not recommend how this headset has such high ratings is beyond me 
0,didn work 
0,i going back to basic and battery operated lost charge at inconvenient times then started being temperamental on taking charge now it won take charge at all worthless to me waste of time and money 
0,a very nice upgrade and replacement mouse with no cords and no batteries perfect 
1,iupdated returned and bought another as really liked the way it fit my hand etc the first one didn get charged til it was out and then wouldn recharge after it died ve plugged this one to charge more frequently and am happy to keep it not going to let it die cuz don want to suffer finding out it design flaw on the other hand could have just been the one first bought am so disappointed received my pretty mouse charged it and love it fits my small hands no clicking sounds easy to use received it around july today is july and the cursor won work hadn charged it so plugged it in to charge the wheel still works but the clicker won work when press it nothing happens would exchange it for new one but then don have many days left to see if it works and really don want to take chance on losing my money these mice seem to work great for some and don work for some may figure out which credit card gives year warranty beyond the normal one which is non existent at least could try again 
1,this headset is beautiful slick and comfortable it does its job with beautiful sound and quality gaming 
0,normal daily use for few weeks scroller suddenly caved in today and stopped working positive reviews must be from people who haven owned it for long or mine was just damaged during shipping nevertheless honestly didn know computer mice could even break returning 
1,i have been using this with my work laptop which use hours daily for remote work ve had this for few weeks and only needed to charge once since then really love the feel of it it near silent and very soft click sound when using buttons like the look of it and the lights so know when it in sleep mode turns on and immediately works with one click completely operational when plugged in to charge as well the charge cord is very short but plugged into the laptop to charge it and it was long enough for me to use it right next to the usb port it was plugged into without being nuisance would love for there to be way to see the battery life on the mouse it the only thing would change add very pleased and hope it lasts long while update this mouse is still going strong still love it use it daily for work day days week still love the lights lol my one and only complaint wish we could see the battery life of the mouse have been charging one every couple of weeks just to be safe hate the laptop mouse it does work when plugged in and charging tho so that is nice just prefer wireless im not knocking off stars due to this at all just offering suggestion to somehow let us see the battery life remaining 
1,decent headphones my sons both have ordered pair and while they generally work pretty well they have had few hangups with them while playing games sometimes they have to be plugged and unplugged couple times before the sound works and sometimes it just doesn seem to want to work at all and yes the volume is up but overall they work about of the time and they were pretty cheap so 
0,it worked fine until it quit one day can really complain because of the price but going to to try something else to replace it 
0,i was looking for simple black led mouse for work and this one is exactly what was looking for it works great and have had no issues yet due to the size it can be little uncomfortable if you are doing lot of work using the mouse for an extended amount of time but this has only happened to me once 
1,i used this headset for my ps works great for chat very clear to listen to cancels out background noise 
1,nice mouse worked great for my needs glides smooth holds charge well 
1,the jbl is really good speaker it surpasses my expectations and it has great sound quality with phone settings you can switch up the sound to your satisfaction am impressed with the tracking too love this product and will continue to use amazon for most purchases overall would absolutely recommend this product to others but make sure you have the right charger and buy case for it so it easy to carry around
0,it deserves stars for not working can hear my game at all super uncomfortable too expensive to not work
1,ordered this for my new laptop works like charm includes charging cable adapter and usb receiver that can be stored in the bottom of the mouse the colors light up very nicely and customer support was lovely contacted them about activating warranty my only issue with this mouse is the shape which was more flat than the mice used to using but that is just personal preference and got used to it very quickly overall great product 
1,great headphones for the xbox husband loved them
0,i like the sound the power button is hard to push it 
0,i bought jbl charge in came with an extra long usb cord and power brick now you get measly ft long cable
1,sound is great but it not the most comfortable it also little big it works well with great with xbox one controller 
1,so cute and ergonomic holds the charge really well probably due to its auto sleep mode and works like charm 
0,worked great after first charge then became choppy and uncontrollable very disappointed in this mouse 
1,i have this same model in bluetooth and it works great needed it for an old yoga win laptop no issues and works great
0,tried to return it today will not hold charge requires different charging cord than iphone cost to much for how bad product is plus ordered protective carrying case separate would not ever purchase again just ordered new bose waterproof speaker 
1,very nice work done on these speakers the sound is rich and beautiful the bass function is amazing it last long the battery charge indicator is perfect and very useful these speakes las very long on single charge the only thing is little uncomfortable is the portability it big and heavy and no handles you will have to buy carrying case separately it too big for easy portability but overall am very satisfied with this device am buying two next time gave this one to granma next time will buy two to pair up it worthy very amazing sound 
1,product worked well until it didn after months won charge or power on 
0,they are too small they are uncomfortable minutes after you try them on
1,love these
1,if you want cheap light up mouse then get this one when it on sale definitely not worth the price otherwise it very quiet and slim but that about where the benefits outweigh the cost the actual lighting is not what advertised it actually pretty dim even in dark room beyond that whenever you move the mouse the red laser at the bottom for tracking movement lights up the whole mouse taking over the other colors being displayed additionally with the hour charge time and the usb needed for connectivity you be better off buying nicer mouse for the same price
0,this is good unit nice bass good sound but had jbl charge three and do not like that cannot use the same charging wire for the amount of money that you charge for the gpo charge for it should come with its own charge wire should not have to go online and purchase charge wire separately or double usb cord let down
0,this is pretty decent set for the price 
1,bose who why spend so much money on bose or these other brands was bose fan for most my life all my vehicles and sound systems in all my vehicles added the bose sound package the only speaker actually believe puts out better and louder sound quality for less than half the price let alone the battery life and the charging abilities over hrs of battery life and includes power back built in to hook up your cell phone or even alexa to play your tunes best speaker for the price would have spent even more on it 
1,great mouse use it for everything from gaming to normal use recommend it
0,x
1,i had to replace my mouse and decided to try this mouse out since it had lot of reviews it works great the mouse looks good and has sleek design the led lights are fun touch and the dpi feature is nice to have had zero issues connecting the mouse to my macbook wirelessly to with the usb port what did notice was my hand started to feel uncomfortable with only an hour of use coming from mouse that had an arch in the design this mouse was little flatter than that another are the clicks and scrolls it definitely is not quiet when it comes to clicking and scrolling it not loud like compared to regular mice but it is louder than my previous quiet mouse did end up returning the mouse but would still recommend this to those who like this mouse design it still great mouse overall 
1,these are so amazing gaming headphones love them cant hear any noise this product is great
1,this headset is very comfortable with good sound and mic got the purple for myself and the pink one for my daughter and they are both very pretty and work great 
1,sounds great and charge lasts longer than other speakers ve owned awesome has built in phone charger as well
1,i ve been using this speaker for couple of months now and the sound quality is awesome really recommend it 
0,it states that it has usbc converter but it does not work

0,doesn charge fast the scroll broke within days the mouse completely stopped working after few weeks it constantly would stick 
1,this mouse works great and love that it rechargeable just plug it in to my laptop for couple hours and we re good to go 
1,love this it feels like an extension of my hand 
0,good
1,works as expected very comfortable sound quality is good great price
1, update this mouse is garbage wrote my review after one day of good functionality but the rechargeable battery seems to only last one day before it starts being jerky and responding inconsistently buttons don always work when click something if take out the usb and turn on off the mouse it fixes it for few minutes until it goes into sleep mode the first one they sent me didn work at all and this new one just doesn work it works better if the mouse is plugged in but the cord is short and stiff ordering something else the mouse works great for my dell laptop fits comfortably sleek profile no problems the button is still audible but quieter than my last mouse had an issue with my first shipment but customer service was very responsive problem solved with me and then shipped me new mouse very quickly 
0, update after using the mouse for around days it just completely stopped working the lights come on and it appears to charge but the buttons no longer work and the optical lens doesn pick up any movement don even bother with this it trash not very reliable mouse after just couple days of use it stops working intermittently which is frustrating wouldn purchase again that said it is very quiet mouse with no audible click and it good size 
1,i was so happy with this mouse when first got it very comfortable loved the light and most of all the wireless feature the love affair however was short lived after using the mouse for only months it stopped working would charge it it would run for minutes then dead again it got to the point that the only way the mouse would work is if kept it plugged therefore defeating the wireless feature 
1,this mouse works well for my needs and fits in my medium sized hands well this is the first mouse ve ever owned with built in rechargeable battery and now don ever want to own one without it the small form factor is also nice for packing up and taking on the go another nicely designed element is that the nano receiver tucks into the bottom of the mouse and doesn require prying off cover or any extra effort to remove or insert 
1,great sound for unit size bluetooth connectivity is flawless 
1,keys don always work right love the lighting effect though
0,have used this mouse for more than month now the cursor jumps around unreliably on the screen making it difficult to navigate battery life is not very long before needs recharging feels very cheaply made in hand do not recommend 
1,really loved the led lights and the noise cancelling awesome
1,i do like the pretty lights and how you can easily use this keyboard in dark room otoh those pretty lights burn the batteries quite quickly so it isn really wireless keyboard it best to keep it plugged in and charging most of the time but that true of basically all wireless lighted keyboards the big problem had was that it just never got along with my computer mac running big sur several times day would have to unplug the wireless dongle shut off the keyboard and then plug in and power up again even then sometimes had to restart the computer after week or so of that gave up and returned the keyboard 
0,it not what expected but it work
1,this product is really good for gaming and the sound quality is so good really like the volume button too 
0,initially charged this mouse overnight and then used it for two eight hour days turning it off overnight couple hours into using it on day it died charged it for several hours and it has no juice and won even turn on would think after couple hours of charging it would at least turn on 
0,good mouse foe every day use
1,bought these for my son for when he playing games on the pc they are comfortable have great sound and simple to set up on windows pc great value and great product 
1,ergonomic would also like to have full size for desktop use multi color led adds nice decorative touch mouse wakes up from sleep mode with first click 
0,this mic is great for gaming but bad for chatting
1,son loves the headset great price 
0,haven tried it yet but looks accurate
0,this product is slim and doesn fail easy click though and lights up charge lasts few day
0,don buy this you have to charge it every day you might as well have mouse with cord because that what it ends up being it does not take battery and hass to be charged all the time 
0,didn like the way the package showed up though it came in the original headphone box so anyone could see it it was also crushed glad the headphones weren damaged 
0,the poor reviews are sometimes exaggerated but the one read is correct my hearing isn what it used to be when waa younger listened to some very wonderful equipment owned by me and some friends my experience includes used to playing the saxophone and other musical instruments can recognize when music and or voices are not in tune have even been accused of perfect pitch with that said can say that the charge is horrible reproducer of sound own four jbl flip speakers and they do great job for their size however the charge has sound profile of loud but muddied bass hollow sounding mids and really poor attempt at the highs tinny sounding like listening to an old am only transistor radio the flip is so much better especially in pairs owning allows me to have two fully charged until the other pair is discharged bought single charge for an anticipated abusive future will be moving soon and as put things in storage and load trucks and trailers wanted something that if damaged it wouldn break up my set of four thought the other reviewer may have received lemon ithought there is no possible way jbl would send out mono speaker especially if the sound is not centered the sound is centered about two inches from center it is very annoying to me outside moving my belongings would be make this design flaw less noticible to imperceptible will return this and get something else 
1,i am casual gamer this seems to be good product for the price 
1,very happy and true to its description 
0,the quality is worth the product 
0,sound is true stereo
1,this keyboard looks good on my desk and is very good for coding 
0,stopped working completely after couple months won charge useless 
0,great for about day then broke stopped working all together beware of these headphones
1,this mouse feels great in your hands you don have to worry about it being difficult to click or scroll as the placement of the buttons are all easy to use and find it also really does light up in different colors it also has setting where you can turn off the light and still use the mouse it is rechargeable through usb and the battery seems to last while overall pretty good 
1,so far very pleased with this product it connected with my laptop automatically with no problems the slim line design slips into my laptop case outer pocket very nicely and there seems to be no issues with charging it from computer port 
1,works perfectly for what needed 
0,the wheel breaks easily
0,i have been able to use this product since aug and then out of the blue the roller wheel stopped working like it disconnected from the internal workings and now wont scroll this is very disappointing 
1,what liked about the headphones is they are good for my games if there is bass or low tones the headphones feel like they shake bit however the headphones are only ok when cancelling noise can still hear some vehicles drive by outside it is my own fault for not reading the description carefully but what do not like about the headphones is that they need usb attachment and you have to plug it in for the lights the usb thats attached to it as cord is really short but over all like them
0,never could get it to work cannot adequately review it 
1,feels like you can turn it up loud enough for some games could be decibel limiter the bass is usually overpowered but not terrible product treble is good quality but bit on the quiet side 
1,it super quiet have it plugged in through hub adapter to google slate tablet and it worked immediately no issues at all lights up and color changes which is just cool add on feature no complaints here very portable 
1,it for gaming with cool lighting my son loves it 
1,great sound
0,it was decent while it lasted but died on me one month after the warranty expired so very disappointed in this product would definitely not recommend it 
1,if you re looking for portable speaker for casual outings or at home say this is great purchase if you re someone like me who works in the kitchen from hours this speaker probably isn worth it with it battery life kinda expected it but didn even have it on max and it ran out on my th hour which was actually almost over an hour off from my other speaker still had pretty large for something that looks like it would have longer charge but that kinda my only gripe at least it sounds nice 
0,product came in as promised and it worked perfect can wait for my pc to come in and try these bad boys out 
1,it was gift for my year old daughter she loves it takes it to the beach and have to keep telling her to turn it down lol 
1,my daughter loves them would highly recommend shipping is fast 
1,this is exactly what needed and love the lighted keyboard great value and shout out to the amazon delivery people who are careful to place packages safely on my porch out of the weather superior service 
1,where has this been all my life talk about making my typing on the tv from my ps way more accurate and fast what great keyboard easy to charge charges quickly and the colors are lovely and bright 
1,i love this keyboard works great with my xbox one happy to see usb type charging port in it this is my first klim purchase but after seeing the quality of this keyboard and reading the note that came with it it definitely not going to be the last 
1,update seller has contacted me asking me to remove my review and attempting to bribe me with money to do so expected this as several other comments say they too received the same bribery they even went as far as sending me here how to remove link purchased this as an upcoming christmas gift for my sister as it was similar to one she wanted that is not available right now the box for the mouse is mostly in another language and paired with the price that prompted me to test it before wrapping it up and giving it to her come the holiday let me just say am glad that did while the mouse powered on and worked fine with the usb dongle that it requires be plugged in to use decided to test it other feature of being able to charge it while using it everything worked fine until unplugged it once unplugged the micro usb cable from the mouse my entire pc turned off thought maybe it was just fluke so tested it again nothing happened the second time so plugged it back in for little bit to make sure it had full charge on it for her and when unplugged it to re package it it happened again as to say am now running virus detecting software to err on the side of caution and this product is getting returned as defective moral of the store don buy cheap products 
1,i guess did not realize that this was only rechargeable and did not take batteries but my daughter loves it 
1,it works perfectly 
1,love the sound quality and ease of use 
0,i am not great typist this keyboard has terrible problem keeping up with the typist have used it several times for word processing and spreadsheet applications on my pc because look at the keyboard when type find out after minute or so of typing look up and find over third of what typed is full of missed letters entire words are missing parts of words are run together the keyboard just doesn register all of my keystrokes have even tried slowing down and being even more deliberate about my touches on the keystrokes same result sending this back for sure 
0,box and packaging was great no physical damage to the head set but it doesn work took it out of the box to plug in and use and never even small noise was able to be heard smh they literally sold me broken product as if it was new and in perfect condition
1,lasted about months we bought cheap headset knowing they wouldn last long my son is hard in headsets so at this point it better to order cheap and replace often instead of really expensive ones that still don last good quality for the value

0,works great can think of anything negative to say 
1,stopped working after few days of use on brand new laptop will turn on but does not function properly lags however great the first few days 
1,the mouse is slim and lightweight love the way that the inbuilt led light in the mouse changes its colors it is very easy to install the mouse on the laptop the day bought the mouse have been using it without charging the battery for days after surfing the mouse on amazon thought found the right mouse for my computer 
1,i am really happy with the purchase of this mouse had been looking for good mouse that cheap and wireless this is the best fit am able to carry this everywhere and has long lasting battery also the range of the bluetooth is really good because was able to control my computer while was another room
1,i liked that the sound quality was great for the price it comfortable although haven worn for more than an hour but sure it will still be comfortable only drawback is the version got had the usb and six cable too short to separate can only plug in one or the other usb is used to light up and six is for the sound so either get lights or sound but not together unless hookup to power bank

0,didn work when first bought it and did even bother with the refund don waste your time go to best buy 
0,i do like the mouse but the usb connector does not go all the way in to my macbook which is frustrating 
1,i recommend everyone for this speaker lucky to have it 
1,very cheaply made it was the biggest waste of my money the piece that plugs into the usb port broke in weeks time as was taking it out of the port it can be glued back together but it would have to be done with precision and carefulness not to get glue all over it dont know that its worth it guess this is one of those things that its just better off going with the brand you trust and paying that little bit extra for something you know is not going to come apart because it was poorly constructed it was pretty cool how it lights up it is very lightweight as well which will leave that to your own interpretation 
1,great product easy to use amazing sound 
1,perfect but would like to see how much battery life have left
1,i got this as gift and the mic is super sensitive love it great quality kinda wish could turn off the lights sometimes they re super bright
0,i loved this mouse it was slick and easy to use however it was not once used on regular basis only used it may hour max each day the charge did not hold and here am less than year in and it no longer holds charge tried to return but not accepted 
1,in my opinion if you dive too deep into youtube reviews regarding decibel comparisons etc etc you ll never end up buying any speaker keeping it simple can tell you this is an awesome portable speaker for it price range take it to the community pool bbq outdoor family events and it perfect long lasting battery good bluetooth connectivity and packs pretty good punch in both volume and bass would maybe consider the larger jbl xtreme if it goes on sale but in all honesty this charge is perfect for what use it for portability to me is more important that little higher volume and bass love the speaker well done jbl 
1,i like the sound quality lot and great bass my only complaint is the bulkiness of the headphones sadly you can change the color of the led lights you can only move the mic up and down and not side to side don feel the noise cancellation though its better than expected for headphones 
0,it is easy to use
1,keyboard was for dual purpose but one was to use for my office computer keys are nice and quiet but very responsive nice looking obnoxious glow adds little flare to my work station 
1, great mouse fits my hand easy to use
1,i like the design love it
0,just stopped working after weeks
0,i had used one of these in my place of work while back and just wanted one for home the only complaint have is mostly that due to the layout of my apartment sometimes it just kinda jumps little depending where my phone is 
1,the sound quality is very good and it is easy hold and carry around think it is better to buy additional case to protect it and carry around more easily

0,the scroll wheel broke
1,the headphones were great they had excellent sound quality the microphone had few issues the audio it pur out was alittle disappointing but with few small adjustments was able to work properly would recommend to any game looking for affordable and good quality headset 
1,the mic broke off within year and they replaced the headphones without hesitation they were interested in how they could improve their product would definitely purchase again without worry as they stand by their products 
1,my son uses school issued chromebook for school work and hates using the touch pad to navigate the mouse so we looked into wireless mouse and found this one had so many good reviews unfortunately the scrolling wheel has already broken and he has only used it month since he only uses it for his school computer it mostly stayed stored safely in the carrying case he was not rough with it and it was stored carefully when not in use am really disappointed because he loved the color and paid for this with his own money earned helping his grandmother over the summer at campground there is an email on the bottom of the mouse that says lifetime replacement but have tried twice now to email them about it and it keeps bouncing back as undeliverable am sure this has been great product for many and we likely got the dud so am not telling anyone not to buy it but am sharing our experience for others to consider 
0,i bought this before christmas for my husband and he started using it on christmas it is now february and the battery just now finally died he uses it every night and it took over months for the battery to die the sound is amazing and it connects perfectly 
1,this keyboard is the best keyboard ever owned my gaming have been better with it if you want own keyboard klim is the best 
0,the first two weeks of using this headset was great but something happened after putting it away and the quality is just poor and is cheaply made do not recommend 
1,i teacher so don want to be attached to my computer at the front the whole day this mouse keeps good charge allows me to walk around my class the whole time stays attached to me the colors just add bit of fun to it 
0,i loved this keyboard but after after maybe year of owning it it doesn hold charge and doesn worked when plugged in very bummed 
1,this is nice little mouse very quiet clicking and get lots of compliments on the changing color lights 
1,my kid loves it
0,if your buy it to play in the dark like did it is worthless put it back in the box use steering wheel and button box so don use key keyboard all the time but when need to have to turn light on to see what key to hit send it back if could and get one that stays lit until turn it off useless to me for playing in the dark 
1,i like that this mouse is rechargeable feels weird in my hand and doesn move as fast as expect
0,the cord broke off within three months now can return them 
0,this piece of junk must have program to discontinue working days after the return date you put on it of march battery will not hold charge guess will go back to buying from costco they give days return on electronics
1,i ordered to use in my office at work it not too loud and love the lights 
0,arrived quickly and damaged my kid loves them so far
1,i bought this for our wrestling room which is very large and this just isn quite big enough for that do however like the sound and feel it is very good speaker just know that it isn for large area 
0,i ve had them minutes haven even plugged them in yet but they are very comfortable think it odd that the extension part above each ear only slides in and out just tiny bit would have thought quality headphones would give you more room for adjustment just thought 
0,like that when not in use
1,i used this keyboard for regular day to day use and gaming first the left shift key failed after few months okay thought got another shift key couple of months later the top number one key failed okay thought again got number pad just no more exclamation points fine can yell at people anymore then the key failed now know this is dumb but seriously my response was fine ill use copy paste for the so go to google and fine to copy ctrl then got to type and use paste ctrl son of please don waste your money here get better keyboard for few more dollars from better manufacturer you deserve better also just like to say vvvvvvvvvvvv 
0,as much as want to give more stars for this product the fact that it is way too heavy on my head and gives me headaches is too big of an issue if the weight of the headset doesn bother you then definitely this is solid product but ve never felt so much weight from headset it kind of concerning that this is also gaming headset because the amount of time people will use it for gaming it can probably cause pain to your neck back in the long run would suggest looking for other products even if this product has lot of good reviews don think anyone should be having this much weight on their head even if it doesn bother them 
0,nuthin
1,this is jbl speaker so mean it is great quality there are many other speakers in the same price range that do not compete in quality or sound 
0,my first internal battery mouse liked the ergonomics but the charging was more frequent than would have liked the mouse was thrown in landfill mere months old because the wheel broke mouse not really going to miss you

1,after one full charge and the charge running out the battery won hold charge ll leave it plugged in for hours to charge only for it to die in about minutes of use definitely better products out there 
1,it feels cheap compared to my corsair it is just average sorry but am spoiled the only thing it has going for it is that it is wireless which is why will keep and use it the keyboard seems to be smaller am touch typist and my fingers feel cramped think it impedes my typing speed pretty good at above wpm don use it for gaming write voraciously and need keyboard that has quick response this one is ummmmm just okay 
1,the mouse worked for couple weeks but now the scroller just spins freeling and won scroll one through pages really disappointed because the mouse as whole worked pretty well for the last couple weeks hopefully just defective model will be returning the item and seeking replacement

1,my gf loves her headset
1,i use it for gaming laptop and it honestly amazing easy to set up and great for the price 
0,no quality
0,i was attracted to this keyboard due mainly to the colorful lighting but after couple of days of use just couldn handle the noise the spacebar made if you use the spacebar lot for gaming you may become distracted and irritated think liked the idea of this keyboard better than the keyboard itself 
1,comfortable good sound quality went with the purple color and love the way it looks happy with my purchase
0,if you had that ve never ending need to have wireless mouse that has led colors on it that needs to be constantly plugged in for it to work then this is for you the charge on it will last approximately hours before it dead if you turn off the pretty lights then maybe it will last hours really not functional wireless mouse don buy it 
1,great sound and great battery life
1,great headphones my kid loves it
0,i charged the mouse overnight and it died within minutes of using it tried to charge it again and it will not charge threw out the box so can return it 
0, its an okay mouse disliked how cheap it appears because the rose gold color got was light spray on top and there are distinct areas where the light is shining through also disappointed that when turn the color changing led off but keep the mouse on that its constant red color which was not in the description it also goes into sleep mode quickly and takes good seconds to reconnect which is frustrating 
1,unlike most people who use speakers like this for fun used it for work as fedex express courier not only did our bigger trucks not have working climate controls arm rests cruise control or insulation from the elements we don have speakers imagine hours on the road in loud tin can shaking and rattling every which way with no music to soothe your stress so one night decided no more of that this speaker fit right into the passengers seat and would strap the seatbelt just incase the trucks had world class terrible suspension the smallest bump in the road would send anything not strapped down flying with that at full volume in the truck that battery might last around or hours but man oh man on full volume it would tune out the road noise tin can truck doors rattling against the metal body everything it made my driving experience so much better that being said would only need full volume on the highway did you know express trucks are governed to mph well assuming our trucks could even easily reach that at least in my station they all had check engine lights and once timed that it took seconds to go from mph to mph fun and when was driving from mph having the speaker at was fine at that rate could make it last about hours before needing recharge thank jbl for creating such great speaker and frankly am sure their other products have that battery capacity needed but got this on sale and it fit right into my backpack for the situation was in it was total game changer went from messy stressy anger to happily singing along to my favorite songs on the off chance another courier reads this making it your routine to turn the speaker off on your way out the door will save battery will have fond memories of driving down my route playing music and singing my heart out for those precious few moments where the stress was pushed to the back of my mind luckily do not work there anymore and this speaker will not see daily use but when needed it my life was much better for it it sat next to an open door in an isuzu reach and never moved centimeter providing me with amazing sound all the while know now anything and everything might throw at it will never take it down if battery life is your concern it is valid if you want the best sound for the size of the speaker this is hard to beat and it has my doing deliveries in tin can with an open door on road at mph still sounding good seal of approval 
0,bought headphones pink and blue and the blue one is great but okie of the pink ones doesn work at all 
1,i couldn believe how amazing this was and the price was unbeatable the features are perfect for gaming and got it in record time

0,very good quality
0, moving fast and light easy to hold for moving
1,it fast and comfortable to use
1,unit is ok but it is mono speaker the sound quality is just not there my charge sounds much better and trust me it has been used it does state that this unit only has one speaker but it is worded that if you take quick glance you would not catch it it should be stated very clearly that this is mono speaker unit not stereo like the rest of the charge models it is an alright unit but had known it was mono would have picked different model jbl it would be in your best interest to discontinue the charge then perhaps you would not get so many bad reviews 
1, year update just wanted to chime in again and let everyone know couldn be happier with this keyboard and the company you wont find better bang for the buck on this website highly recommendedvery comfortable keyboard smooth keys with good curve on the top charges with usb type single charge lasts for around week

0,i use for work it is needing to be charged almost every days 
0,terrible product only reason still have it is because amazon told me just to keep it when requested return and refund battery doesn last at all feels terrible in your hand and the buttons and scroll ball are not accurate stay away there are plenty of other cheap rgb mice 
1,work perfect for gaming and lights are nice bonus 
1,the sound quality on these headphones are really good one of my friends who uses them for gaming recommended them to me and said they ve last him long time so far ve had no issues the sound cancelation is also amazing compared to my last pair of headphones
0,update actually purchased three of these and received them on august began using one immediately for work put another one in my computer bag for when travel and the third was intended as back up as noted below less than months after purchased these the first one which was using daily quit working got the one from my computer bag which had never been used because my travel for work has been limited due to the pandemic this one quit working after only days on november then went to the third one that bought as back up after using this one for less than week it has started to malfunction the scroll wheel has quit working but everything else still works on november received an email from the manufacturer asking me to delete my review in exchange for refund received another email the next day with misrepresentation that it was from amazon costumer service also asking me to delete my review in exchange for refund that could expect in hours after removing the review not sure if the misspelling was intentional to avoid getting in trouble with amazon or just poor commend of the english language purchased this on august and it quit working on november less than three months after purchased it the return window was days so no chance will get refunded for this piece of garbage don waste your money on this 
0,if you re looking for wireless mouse keep looking this is not it the first one received didn charge so they sent me another one which started using at the beginning of july and now it doesn work anymore didn even last months with normal usage no gaming or anything such shame because actually liked it 
1,fantastic sound and small enough to take anywhere
0,really smooth soft click liked

1,my six year old grandaughter is gamer ve been told all know is that these headphones is on her head most of the time see her she prefers this set over two previous pair her parents bought her so grandparents still getting kisses for buying my grandbaby pair she really liked 
0,i really wanted to like this mouse as it lightweight and cute but it not worth it when the mouse charge dies quickly and since it not compatible with my macbook can use it while charging since have to use the same adapter for both sensor and charging also lights stopped changing colors and you can set to one color 
1,overall the headphones felt like plastic toy you buy from the dollar store there is no noise cancellation because they don close around your ears completely not sure if this is flaw in design or got pair that was made incorrectly but either way save your money for this price you can get something better and not have to go through the hassle of returning it or the disappointment of thinking you re getting something good for the price 
1,pretty cool devise easy to install no instructions needed
0,i started using this keyboard and it was perfect until hit the spacebar the spacebar makes rattling noise when you even touch it at all you don even have to press it down it unavoidable to make this sound no matter how gingerly you press the key unless this was single unit problem this design is garbage as silent keyboard 
0,didn last worked for short while guess you get what you pay for 
0,i bought these for my daughter they worked well for the first months and then suddenly the sound quality became choppy and distorted unable to use them waste of money
1,i have tryed many times to change the colors and they wont change but the battery last for good long time
1,best purchase made on amazon highly recommended 
1,love it 
1,perfect for child for gaming and sound quality great price
0,these headphones are nice to look at but the microphone sucks most gamers of any level or even someone who needs to use it for zoom conferences needs decent quality mic this is not that the positive reviews must only be focused on the sound and the look just got these couple hours ago and will be returning smh
1,i got sick of using my touchpad and needed an actual mouse for printing software trying to rotate and re size print patterns with touchpad was nightmare but this is great mouse for the price and has already made my life lot easier 
1,this mouse works well and is easily rechargeable and portable wouldn recommend using it for gaming but it perfect if you need wireless mouse to take with your laptop

0,my stapler has destroyed uncountable mouse by stapling through the cord that is one headache ll not miss thank you it wonderful product 
0,looked nice while it lasted but it wouldn charge after two months of light use 
1,my son has only been using the headset for few days but he likes it and it appears to be more durable than the xbox brand we ve been through several of those in short period of time 
1,okay performance while it worked but definitely won buy it again and would not recommend it to others 
0,i ve had this mouse for almost months it worked so well and the color changing lights add little pizazz unfortunately the scroll wheel stopped working it no longer has tension on it it just spins now and moves nothing on the screen 
1,roller will not work the mouse won scroll seems to be very common it never worked 
0,stopped working within month won charge light comes on and goes right out bought plan on sending the other one back still in the box 
1,for this is the best wireless mouse ve ever used set it up in two minutes feels good in my hand the scrolling wheel is nice and the clicking is silent cannot stand loud clicking mice got this for my work computer and think also going to get one for my laptop 
1,this mouse is wonderful and easy to use without mouse pad which is big plus bought this to replace my old wireless mouse because the usb plug is shorter and does stick out the side of my laptop to far it is rechargeable and lasts for while thanks to the sleep function which is easy to exit from love that you can choose to have it light up and changes colors totally worth the buy 
1,its perfect for gifts
0,disappointed in this mouse the wheel broke after months 
1,great speaker lasts about hours on full volume
1,it been few months and still works well very nice purchase thank you 
1,i wound up returning because non longer needed it but it did try it out and it worked amazingly love how quiet and sleek it was and the adapter was perfect for my macbook

1,love this product comfort noise cancellation great for gaming
1,i tried to get my daughter nice mouse for her minecrafting and man what waste of this mouse was it connected to its included dongle just fine but almost broke nail taking the dongle out of the mouse body if you don have something slim to wedge in between the dongle and the mouse body prepare for some ouchies do you like the rainbow effect well hope you also enjoy less than day of battery life is your battery dead now welp can charge and use the mouse at the same time do you think it be nice to use long braided usb cord as wire for this mouse nope the micro usb only supports charging not data don hate yourself don get budget mouse if you want good mouse for roughly more check out the razer basilisk it supports bluetooth usb and it has excellent battery life my son uses it every day for minecraft roblox youtube and purchased it at the end of january it is now mid may and ve changed its single aa only once you won be disappointed 
0,trash st set broke impossible to get in touch with manufacturer so amazon replaced them set broke too aux plug comes loose so audio and mic is useless waste of 
0,although haven tested its water resistance cause im paranoid 
0,the top is not opaque like the photos it translucent there is only one lighting mode there is no rainbow effect on the edge like the photo 
0,this is broken within month 
1,i bought this mouse for my daughter and she absolutely loves it would defiantly recommend this mouse and would purchase again especially for the price 
0,sorry usually dont leave bad reviews but this one takes the cake it started working at first but then it started to be very laggy and then no longer worked now am using brand new macbook so maybe it the usb converter that might be problem but currently not fan 
0,the multi color lights where handy but my eyes could not adjust to the colors 
1,overall love the build and the color and feel of the keyboard but do not like the style of the enter key instead of tall enter key it would be better and more comfortable to have the long enter key like most standard keys 
1,bigger and heavier than my sonos roam but sounds little better and it cheaper plus you can charge devices from it 
1,i was happy to get the gift from my sister sound quality was great when tried it out before putting it to full use on my patio wanted to fully charge the speaker guess what no usb charging cord in the packaging nor any set up documentation found some on line but it was quickly apparent that my usb cords for my iphone would not work to charge the device had to order what hopefully will fit replacement from amazon extremely disappointed with bothamazon and the seller 
1,i really like this mouse it is low profile and fits my small hands perfectly the only thing really don like about it is all the flashes of different color lights on it need to check to see if there is way to disable the light feature otherwise very nice mouse 
1, these headsets are so freaking loud and they look amazing love them soooo freaking much highly recommend these 
1,great portable bluetooth speaker max volume could be better but certainly recommend the purchase 
1,i use this speaker on my pool deck great sound 
1, sound battery life build quality led too bright don time out they have daisy chain feature you can use but it been hit miss with us these speakers are fantastic for the price we bought of the charge and charge the only reason these aren star for us is that the primary use is in the bedroom to play sleep stories music the leds for buttons on top never time out while the speaker is turned on and are sooo bright in dark room unfortunately we have to drape something over the top of the speaker to hide the lights stars if that weren an issue as for battery life use one in my office all week for conference calls with desk mic and charge it only every other week fantastic 
1,truly impressive sound and battery life bought one while back and bought this one for my son who just just got married and bought his first house he loves it and her 
0,do not buy this mouse stopped working august st yesterday thought it was just dead so made sure to charge it this morning go to use the mouse and it still is not working despite it being fully charged it just doesn turn on anymore am extremely disappointed because just bought this mouse on june th meaning that the return window closed on july th this mouse stopped working entirely doesn even turn on anymore two days after the return window closed do not buy this product if could give it less stars would 
1,i bought this for the home shop and it makes really nice sound love it so far 
0,i have purchased charge in and received charge for some reason checked the receipt to double check that didn accidentally buy so now have spent an extra bucks on speaker that did not order 
1,it arrived with slight crack picture of crack in front of keyboard attached this keyboard was purchased for my son to help with school from home since he was excited to use it and it would be helpful and since there pandemic didn want to have to ding around with going someplace to return it and didn want to be without it so far it works and the light up colors make him interested in using it which possibly translates to him doing better more timely job with his schoolwork hopefully the crack does not cause it to fail sooner than expected 
0,when plug the usb into the computer it takes away my internet settings cannot connect to the internet and it shows no networks to connect to don know how to fix it 
0,the mouse works but after less than week of use by my son the roller ball no longer works you can scroll with it the rest of it works for now but will probably not make it through the school year 
1,loved the look and feel of this mouse but after only weeks of school the usb completely came apart when pulled it out of my son chromebook there was no impact or anything to cause this and the kiddo was quite upset that it broke because he loves the look of this mouse as well as how it feels in his hand 
0,the mouse will not charge and it feels cheaply made 
0,with in the span of one week it broke first intermittent hiccups flickering light and then none functional the good thing is that it broke soon enough to be returned to amazon 
1,i purchased this mouse for my thinkpad running linux and it worked like charm set up was breeze simply plugged it in and it worked it even works when in the settings this mouse is hard to beat for the price 
0,the mic is broken out of the box and it isnt very loud
1,you can really beat the price it actually little nicer than was anticipating given what paid would say it worth the price just this with my chromebook for my online classes the light is really cute too 
1,i bought pink one and the color is just so cute it very easy to use plug the dongle into the usb port and the mouse works immediately it also has multi colored lights to help you from getting bored while working studying really like this product and high recommend for people who are looking to buy mouse with reasonable price 
0,this mouse worked well for while months but now it is very unreliable switched usb ports got an extender thinking the connector was blocked by my metal desk that helped some but it lags and the click only works about half the time have classroom full of first graders who are waiting on my silly mouse to get it together so can show them the next slide or open the video for them it has been super frustrating will be purchasing another brand 
1, bought for gentle pc gamer girl this headset is pretty good one would say the microphone kind of sounds like you re talking on toaster so would recommend getting separate mic setup if you re planning to use these for streaming or making videos the volume control is located on the cord the only complaint have is that it occasionally gets stuck in the arm of my chair and lowers itself the lights are not colored it looks to just be regular led lights in plastic casing so if you re buying these for someone who rages at games they could very easily break them 
0,the only thing dislike is the wire getting tangled 
0,started out and loved this mouse butwithin months it would not hold charge for more tha few hours annoying having to use it plugged in bought this for the convenience of only having to rechage every couple of days to this in unacceptable if it was even once day could handle it since like the mouse but can stand charging every few hours so sad 
0,these were really nice in the beginning don use my headset often for personal reasons somehow this magically has short in it the sound was never that great and always static like anyway 
1,got this for my son for christmas he loves it for his xbox 
1,the best
1,it great mouse to have if you are trying to have mouse that can be used on type only device while keeping the option of normal usb open 
0,this lightweight mouse worked fine for about three weeks then it stopped working would plug it in to charge and after about seconds it would stop charging no charge no power disappointing 
1,had some issues with my first headphones purchased and customer service reached out to me to rectify the situation and the new pair they sent is amazing pleasantly surprised with the quality thank you guys again for going above and beyond for your customers 
1,these headphones are comfortable and affordable the quality is average but it is good enough for the price 
1,i love the speaker works great wish it came with better instruction manual for all of the features 
1,i have been struggling to find gaming headset that had both good sound quality and working microphone this headset ticks both boxes wish bought this one first also really like that they provide the adapter 
0,as ve just learned by searching questions after using it for few weeks the scroll wheel stops working also these are silly lights for grownup they remind me of those kids shoes that light up when they step green pink yellow lights are kid or gamer colors every time try to save buck regret it off to buy new one 
1,great speaker
1,for the size of this unit and the design of the passive woofers the bass should be deeper mids and highs are clean bluetooth range is excellent maybe its because the drivers are parallel to the surface first facing upward downward have smaller the size single bluetooth speaker and it bass is excellent for its size it connects immediately 
1,i have small hands and this fits perfectly very cute and lightweight
0,this item is poorly made battery died within minutes after full charge hours it was returned the same day it was delivered 
1,i needed slim responsive mouse and got exactly what needed bought for work and connected with no issues would definitely recommend for anyone looking for reliable mouse customer service too 
1,this was bit bigger than was anticipating but not complaining while that does affect portability slightly it still very easily transported especially with the case sold separately but worthwhile investment it loud and sounds great and the battery life is amazing there bigger better model for little more money but for my needs this works fantastic had some trouble with using it while camping as it seemed to only be picking up mono you could hear the background music and noises like doors slamming and whatnot but not the dialogue not sure if the problem was with the speaker the transmitter or the tv it was hooked up to hooking up bluetooth headphones the sound was perfect and hooking up this speaker to different devices the sound has also been perfect so don know where the breakdown was

1,needs better battery life but overall good wireless mouse great customer service but they will contact if leave bad review 
1,it quiet and esthetically pleasing 
1,we bought speakers to see which one we loved more this was the note expensive one and after we tried then both it wasn even close the quality of this speaker was awful compared to an off brand and it was half the cost wouldn spend this type of money on it just for the name there are better ones that are way better and cheaper 
0,loved the product look and that it was rechargeable however the battery didn hold the charge long enough for the device to properly connect via bluetooth so you had to leave it plugged in which defeats the purpose of wireless mouse also the shape for the mouse provided little comfort as it caused my palm to cramp after two days of use returning item and going back to logitech brand 
0,looked cool but it broke within the first couple hours of use too late to return it so guess have to just eat my investment

1,bought this mouse for my wife to use with her new macbook air must say this mouse has exceeded all expectations very happy with my purchase and will refer anyone looking for quality mouse to this business 
0,did not work straight out the box 
0,i like the overall design the slim profile and touch is good and the clicks are responsive where struggling with this mouse is that as trying to work there is lag and the mouse will then jump around on the screen also trying to hold and highlight group of text for some reason it loses connection what ve ended up having to do is clicking on my document and then using my shift arrow keys to highlight the text that need for general web browsing this mouse isn bad for productivity it not really working for me and going to go back to my wired mouse

1,the sleekness of it and the colors loved it for work 
1,great
0,lights are very dim and cut off after seconds no way to change it this wouldn be problem per se but the letters on the keyboard are very dark white even with the lights in the room on they are hard to see until you press button to get the backlight on so if you use your keyboard in darkish room this is hard pass don have to look at my keyboard to type but if have let the backlight go out while think about something else and my hands leave the keyboard have to spend few seconds orientating my hands at the correct spot this is real pain also not as quiet as they make it sound ve had cheaper non name wired keyboards that were almost completely silent 
1,nice product at fair price like it loud and it is plenty loud 
1,the mic quit no way to contact the manufacturer bought an asurion protection plan and they won help either big waiste of money

1,my son loves this headset in particular he broke his first one and was so happy to see it at an actual lower price than had purchased before he loves the led features and how clear the sound is will continue to buy this brand everytime he rages in fortnite 
1,my boyfriend bought these for gaming and he likes them the only thing he has said is that it feels like it squeezing his ears maybe they re little tight but other than that he loves them he literally wears them for hours sometimes so don think the ear thing is that serious

1,not into the latest commercial fads but am very impressed by these radios the size and sound is about the same as high end radio this streaming radio has an unlimited operating range along with solving many of the problems associated with bad reception truly revolutionary breakthrough for the still strong radio listening audience living in nyc am now able to clearly listen to one of my favorite radio stations from massachusetts along with one in my area that has weak signal love its portability along with its apparently long rechargeable battery life have listened to higher rated more costly products of the same size but honestly hear very little difference own much higher end powerful stereo system for more engaging musical experience well designed water resistant portable unit that can be used at home or outdoors have fun finding some of your out of area online radio stations and enjoy this wonderful new technology 
0,it was easy to install and worked the first time 
0,gaming
0,my son received these headphones for xmas months ago they worked great for the most part the switch to turn the mic on and off was touchy he occasionally have to flip it back and forth to get it to work he said sound was great and noise canceling was ok the worst part is that he was using it today and the cable cord just came apart as far as know it not fixable unless get soldering gun but have no idea how to do any of that we have one bummed kiddo 
0,cord and wires are low quality after only few weeks of use speaker goes in and out and you have to play with the jack and cord to get it to work

1,works great
0,doesn hold charge very long 
0,incompetent customer service actually really bad is proper word the keyboard is not waterproof and overall it not worth the money
0,i just upgraded from budget wired keyboard to this my first wireless keyboard pros types quiet keys are responsive and smooth old budget keyboard was hurting my fingers from extended use feels light and minimalist had long sittings without needing to recharge with backlight turned off it uses usb charger cons no dedicated buttons for volume etc there are function shortcuts fn key for volume control and calculator this is nitpicking but guess rather have the dedicated buttons for one press instead of hitting the two combined the lighting has distinct high pitched noise that is audible and frustrating had to turn it off completely didn buy it for the backlight but it still shame that can ever use it 
1,i love this speaker mainly use it in my garage gym so can listen to music but still hear my baby monitor if my kid wakes up during his nap it easier than using headphones never have to have it up to full volume to get what want out of it it has good range and it easy to use and pair with your phone we also use it at our fire pit and seems durable great battery life use it lot and rarely charge it when do it charges fast it gotten some ash on it but nothing is affected super happy hope to have it long time 
0,i bought this for gaming with friends on ps and for the first few days it worked fine but after that the sound quality just got really bad and it started noticing some of the flaws which just proved to me how cheaply made they were if you don mind that they ll be alright for the price but for me and many others it ll hardly be worth it 
0,good sound
1,love everything about it 
0,the calibration on this is terrible can even use it it goes all over the place doesn go where im directing it to go make calls for work on my computer and it hung up when was clearly going to the opposite side of the screen it terrible 
0,does not work
1,great sound for small speaker 
0,good product 
0,i have had this mouse for all of minutes and am planning on returning it honestly it looks nice and like that it rechargable however it easily one of the worst ve ever used ve used probably different models in my career alone first clicking the mouse requires much stronger force than any other mouse ve used and on top of that it very inconsistent looking through the gaps where the leds show out of can see the mechanical device which actuates the click is tiny plastic arm no chance that will lasts for an expected period of time it seemed to have been packaged fine so don believe it was damaged or doa don buy this 
1,worth every penny sounds great
0,precise led optional lightweight mouse has slot for bluetooth and is rechargeable no more batteries stellar with the precision mouse pad
0,volume level needs to be high for microphone to work normally but the high volume has way too much base and hurts your ears plus the ear muffs are too small need to spend about or more on quality headsets like astro turtle beach or other brands 
1,the style is nice and the sound quality is great 
1,great sound new it was good plan to buy thanks so much
0,this mouse was very useful and relatively enjoyable the first week and half at two weeks it seemed to glitch the cursor would jerk and freeze so connected the mouse to the charger it was ok for couple of days but sadly succumbed to its cheapness this afternoon very cheaply made product maybe those star reviews are bought very disappointing 
1,i have charge and when the charge went on sale had to get another one love these little speakers
1,everything works great except for the mic the mic wont transmit at all the customer service however contacted me shortly and refunded me for my purchase as well as apologized know that sometimes issues happen and its the way that companies fix things that make big difference they did right by me and salute themfor that will definately do business with them again

0,sleek and reliable
1,this company deserves stars for their incredibly prompt and wonderful customer service this company truly stands by their product my klim keyboard stopped working after about years since they had year warranty reached out and they quickly responded they asked me to shipped the defective keyboard back to them they would refund the shipping cost and they would also send me new replacement keyboard in the meantime however realized really don care for this keyboard layout don use this keyboard for gaming it primarily for work so the short enter key was irritating at times unlike standard keyboard this one has three keys in between the and enter keys rather than just two keys like typical keyboards so declined their replacement offer didn want to go through the shipping hassel for replacement that don care for was just going to cut my loss look for something else and thought that was the end of it however they immediately offered me full refund or the option to try the upgraded version that has the standard layout the light opted for the latter the keys in the upgraded version are very quiet and feels bit mushy but it works great and highly recommend this company you can definitely purchase with confidence they really do stand behind their warranty and the level of customer service they provided was top notch they were extremely caring easy quick and hassel free

0,dislike completely do not buy do not pass go this product is useless for its intended purpose yes want to use the light feature which requires me to plug in the usb cable which is only long same length as the audio cable that plugs into the controller unless your willing to sit with portable charger this product is of no use to me and recommend anyone that wants to use the product for its intended purpose to wait until they make the cable an adjustable length veteran nerd out

0,this mouse would not connect to my compute despite multiple attempts following the instructions given as is typical of many amazon products this product is cheaply made and not worth wasting your money on would suggest avoiding making purchases from this brand in the future and strongly suggest not buying this mouse unless throwing money away on broken pieces of junk that don work is past time of yours then knock yourself out

0,it is nice looking and quiet
1,a lot of people were jumping on this speaker for the fact that it is mono speaker and just wanted to stand up for it you can hardly tell the difference between the and the unless you stand very close the two stereo speakers in the charge are just so close together it doesn really matter and the difference is small the sound quality is definitely improved however the mid and highs are not muddy like the and the bass is slightly deeper making very enjoyable sound experience the only gripe have about it is that it cannot be speakerphone or connect with siri or google assistant but that is minimal compared to the improvement of sound quality if you have the don upgrade it still isn worth it but if you are deciding between getting the or the get the

1,i really like the ability to quickly turn on and off the mic

0,it ok but getting the dongle out was quite the challenge not the greatest design on that part 
0,good mouse
1,i bought it for my grandson he was so excited and loves it he says that the sound is clear 
1,it is comfortable product its price quality ratio is good think it is good product 
0,i like it 
1,it an ok product for the most part there are few things that noticed that lead me to give this product only stars the sleep time on the led feature is too short and not adjustable it turns off the led lights after about seconds and if you re trying to use it in the dark this defeats the purpose of getting an illuminated keyboard there should be an ability to leave it on the brightness on the led lights is not very good in completely dark room it may be passable but in room with partial illumination like lamp or even the light from your tv monitor screen the keys get little lost and not easy to see since they blend with the glare from the screen the chroma colors make such dimly lit product that much harder to see and you can adjust this it would be better if you could make it just green white or blue lights but the chroma color runs across the keyboard and the red color is very dim to top it off the leds are so far under the keys that you get more of halo effect around the underside of the key than lighting up the key characters themselves the only pros have about this product are the price cheap for what it is the quiet no click of the keys perfect if someone else is in the room trying to sleep usb charger compatible aside from the things mentioned at the top of this post there are some extras that could have made this product better dedicated buttons for ff rev play pause vol up down mute having to constantly press function button for basic features like those when you want to control music or volume is annoying removable rechargeable batteries you can replace and charge in the unit when the charger is plugged in had mouse that did this and it was great feature and when the battery could no longer hold charge just replaced it the ghz dongle is awesome but also having bluetooth option can make this better and able to connect to devices that don have usb ports but keep the dongle not happy with mine will return it and spend little more on better solution for me 
1,this was such great deal that could not pass up the noises in the house have gone down from screaming to soft chatter in the background such pleasant surprise and what wonderful gift this has brought to my entire family 
1,i use this at work it great everyone asks me about my keyboard all the time have adhd and it actually helps me focus

0,absolutely loved this mouse but it stopped working all of the sudden after reading reviews it seems several others had the same issue but guess that what you get when you purchase something that is only 
1,very nice sleek little mouse its not the color ordered really don like rose gold but the price is great its otherwise everything wanted and is good product does what its supposed to do just wish it was black lol btw checked did order black 
1,i love the sleek design and silence of it helps out alot when doing school at night and the lights around the side make it fun
1,great slim line wireless mouse pairs well with all computers easy to charge and sleep mode is plus highly recommend
0,do yourself favor and don waste your money this cheap flimsy mouse that only works for couple of weeks 
0,i purchased this on dec just about month ve been using it just quit working today turned off and back on and restarted computer still doesn work so not happy got only month out of it and it stopped working 
1,the mouse is well built and works as intended the led lighting is pretty cool step above the daily dull plain mice out there 
1,great item sadly the key caps are not customisable but still good quality and feels sturdy 
1,my hubby loves it
1,i really like this mouse love that it doesn need batteries you just charge it and it ready to go did have issue with my macbook pro when connecting the adapter for the receiver it comes with to my computer it changed my scrolling ability on my laptop trackpad and wasn able to scroll without using the mouse had to call apple to figure out how to fix it and that when discovered removing the usb adapter the mouse comes with from my computer solved the problem have usb to usb adapter from the mac store so just used that for the mouse receiver and it worked perfectly and it doesn change my scrolling ability with the trackpad at all 
0,everything
1,this worked great for months then it just stopped working it fully charged but won work tryed changing adapter and still doesn work not an expensive mouse but not worth anything if it doesn work 
1,this product works great got new laptop and needed mouse and the look of this was just what wanted the features are easy to use and it charges quickly would definitely recommend this product 
1,my son loves them
1,sounds good but so many of these companies spend more budget on marketing spinners rather than solid honest technology the talk of of these producing stereo via the app may or may not be true don mind buying two but this intentional vagueness really sucks we need more engineers and less marketers in this world engineers with budgets build good stuff marketers dance and hide stuff no mic for phone calls will update when abd if find the time to unravel the intentional fog others seem to have plenty of comments which may have good info happy with the mono sound so far will keep for now 
1, awesome mouse is totally silent durable case feels completely comfortable in my hand love the colors 
0,i removed the mouse from it box threw the box away and charged the mouse started using it and on the second day it just stopped working because couldn return it in it original box just threw it away 
1,really like this mouse never thought say that it stores the usb port in its belly when you need to disconnect which is super helpful for someone who loses small pieces it quiet click which appreciate even when working alone and the rainbow lighting is optional win win win it light too as it rechargeable carry it with my laptop and it made working on the go better
1,i absolutely love these headphones they are great quality for the price my brother recommended them to me and really enjoy being able to chat with him while gaming 
1,super cute for an easy cheap alternative to gaming headset the sound quality is definitely not bad for the price if the game is loud enough noise surrounding you is practically canceled but not completely mute id say good for kids and good for quick need of headset in pinch headband is bit flimsy but definitely lasts for good while 
1,i love how it lights up and is comfortable for for my hand 
1,my son loves this headset he can hear me talking to him so no disruptions to his game sound quality is great but don have to hear the gameplay 
1,this keyboard is excellent would buy it again use it for gaming have no complaints in that regard have set up where my pc is in another separate room from my bedroom it connected to my tv via foot hdmi power cables even through the wall it still manages to get good reception with minimal lag occasionally if positioned really far away in my bedroom on my bed rather than in my gaming chair it will have some brief noticeable lag but if turn it off turn it on again it goes back to normal this issue won be problem for most people since they will likely be in the same room as their pc don want to don like the noise however small that any pc makes the biggest issue have with this keyboard is the sound it makes when the rgb is on it this high pitched squealing sound it goes away as soon as the rgb is turned off this isn problem for me since don care about rgb one bit and prefer to have it off so it saves battery but everytime the keyboard turns on the rgb is automatically on and hence the sound is immediately there when turn it on and have to turn it off everytime which is minor inconvenience then again probably have to do turn it off anyways since turn off the lighting to save battery but the sound is noticeable it not as loud as computer fan or anything but since it high pitched you won not notice it 
0,the first day it worked great but the second day it barely tracks at all and when try and click on anything to open documents or emails it takes several tries before it works what waste of money going back to my old mouse 
1,great sound quality
1,i purchased two of these one works of the time get some ghost keys and missed keys but it is something can live with this second keyboard though wow just wow maybe half the keys work at most charged it up tried multiple computers oses etc same result get maybe half the keys working it is very random too as to when it happens and which keys spend little extra and get something that is actually worth it and if you are worried about accuracy buy wired 
0,the product malfunctioned after the first couple of weeks one of the connections stopped working 
1,big bang for your buck durable waterproof and great battery life
1,i know it is better to give than to receive and am so happy my mother in law loved this gift she was used to staticky radio broadcasts of her favorite programs this speaker sounds so much better than mine now want one the battery life is impressive and the sound quality is great hard to believe this thing is splash proof 
0,the only thing dislike is the fact of they have to be plugged in power supply
1,i bought these for my son and daughter and they love them my son is and huge gamer and my daughter is and constantly chatting with someone super happy with the item definitely worth the money 
1,we used for gaming works great and really good price for the quality 
1,i love the quality of the sound the device is easy to set up and it pumps out great bass and treble my house has concrete walls throughout the house so can use it beyond line of sight of my laptop would definitely recommend this
0,this headset came with the microphone not even working it wouldn show up on my computer it either the headset is broke or the cord is and on top of that you can hear what going on in the headset even if you re not the one wearing it very disappointed 
1,this mouse is true to its description in that it silent and ergonomic but it wasn worth the money for me bought it in april and had to throw it out in january around november of started experiencing issues with charging where have to wriggle the cord around before it would start charging by january it was clear that there was an issue not with the charging cable but with the charging port in the mouse it was loose and wiggly when held the mouse up and it would only charge if held the mouse in my hand and kept the charger pressed in tightly recommend looking elsewhere for cute mouse 
1,practically all bluetooth speakers are mono it has nothing to do with how many drivers speakers cones it has to get stereo sound you usually need to have two of the same or typically at least the same brand bluetooth speaker and send different audio right or left to each one the charge had two forward facing mid high range drivers driven by same signal so they effectively acted as one driver speaker charge replaced the two forward facing drivers with single larger higher quality forward facing driver that produces better depth and definition at least in my opinion ll take the charge over the charge or the flip any day 
1,i got these for my son it connected to his ps easily and he loves them he is btw 
1,the mouse is ergonomic very easy to use the price is not bad either all in all good purchase 
1,i was tired of using wireless mouse that needed change of batteries to quickly lucky found these wireless rechargeable mouse the first thing did when the package arrived was to charge the mouse fully so far is working without problems the mouse is slim and very comfort the multicolored led is delightful touch that will be an excellent companion to the multicolored led mouse pad my review is based on regular use can have opinion regarding how the mouse works for gaming because just controller for that update after just few months the surface of the mouse looks like is peeling and is very noticeable even with proper cleaning the mouse keeps working and the leds 
1,love the lights 
0,stopped working shortly after can get refund or exchange
1,i like that it sounds noise cancellation really good what don like is that it heavy and too small tight for my big year old head cm or inches in circumferences gaming for long time like hours make you really dizzy aftereffect are bad headaches nausea and disorientation due to uncomfortable so don really recommends this for adults or kids with big head would like if this headphone extends bit more maybe like inch it would make the grip less so it won be uncomfortable 
1,love it very ergonomic
1,functions exactly as described love it 
0,really cool setup only drawback is you have to order usb adapter separate to use the light function on ps 
0,does not last x
1,i love mine can hear it all over the house
0,very high quality
1,good mouse for the price and the buttons do not make noise so it feels nice when clicking which is win for me
1,jbl xtreme has better sound quality and would be tons better than two of these in stereo unless you re going for stereo image two of these wouldn be bad for the money though you ll have worse quality audio if money isn an issue two xtreme in stereo is the best option you cannot use flip with charge to use stereo speakers need to be the same to utilize stereo mode 
0,smooth clicking ran out of battery quickly so shut it off when not in use 
0,this thing rocks 
1,excellent product highly recommend 
1,super good quality microphone and headphones bought these to start streaming and the microphone only picks up my voice so don need to worry about background noise being picked up the headphones themselves are also really amazing crystal clear sound highly recommend these to anyone looking for an affordable and great quality headset 
1,cute mouse love the blue on it and the lights are cute touch its very lightweight very quiet no clicking sounds from the mouse which is great 
1,very good mouse recommend 
0,it needs charge ever other day even if it is not used what junkwhen it needs charge sometimes it will charge and other times it does not so now own this klim wireless keyboard that requires the usb cable to be attached to work
1,i bought this and originally gave it perfect review because the sound quality is great but the actual quality is not after less than days it quit charging and quit working called amazon who offered refund when purchased it it was they told me they would refund me and then could order new one and now they are when it worked it works great but it just did not last long on amazon did not really do any favors with replacing sure the reason they did not replace it is because the price has gone up or the sale is over asked for replacement and they told me no they gave me refund and told me to re order so that they instead so sure they can make more money not happy and very unimpressed do not recommend buying the speaker through amazon because amazon seems to be the crappy one here go buy it at costco who will honor the same price and replace it 
1,nice mouse portable works great silent like the changing colors
1,great value mouse does it job and can complain with this price
0,i bought this for my nephew and unfortunately he told me that its just all over the place on his chromebook screen doesn go where you need it to go etc
1,this mouse is on point literally had never thought of buying one to this slant and size until the color locked me in it an absolute match to my laptop the setup was quick and easy simply turned it on input the usb and was using within seconds it very versatile and works with or without pad lightweight and easy to store with the flat shape 
1,great
0,i cannot get this mouse to work even when plug in with cord
1,great price functions well comfortable to wear
1,we have the jbl flip and the charge that are able to sync together and provide coverage over the whole apartment so that we can listen to the same thing in the kitchen in the study in the living room in the bathroom or on the deck syncing is easy and intuitive volume control on the secondary speakers is controlled individually and you can pause them without interrupting anyone else listening or we can individually bluetooth to speaker and listen to different things or we use the speakers to amplify laptop sounds these are perfect simple to use and easy to understand we are so happy with them 
0,listening to podcasts
1,works good for gaming good sound quality could be louder
0,can just say wow this mouse is absolutely incredible the wireless feature and led lights make this thing steal for its price it is super helpful when want to stay in bed but still use my pc from afar can just pull this bad boy out and start going it has silent clicks to it as well so you wont be waking or bothering anybody buy using this mouse and with its low profile shape and structure it takes up practically no room whatsoever 
0,i have macbook and this mouse required two plugins since take my mac with me the chances of these plugins being lost was pain 
1,people always ask me about my mouse when use it at school love the colors love that its rechargeable its small and lightweight so its great for what use it for which is with my laptop at school in the lab ve already dropped it few times and it still works no complaints 
1,pretty good
0,nice light cool not brightness expected but decent price stars
1,this mouse was so cute and easy to use love the colors but after two months it won connect to my computer it sometimes lights up but not consistently and my computer doesn recognize it 
1,very sleek design bought this as christmas gift for my son it connected easily to his chromebook and the lights are pretty cool 
0,very nice keyboard fast shipping
0,nobody order this piece of crap its trash cant even fortnite cause its too freaking twitchy
0,this product is crap do not buy opened fresh out of the box and immediately had trouble lightweight and cheap feeling does not slide particularly well although sleek it isn the most ergonomic thing but worst of all after plugging in and turning on the mouse will work normally for around secs if you leave it idle for longer than that the response becomes choppy and the mouse essentially stops working tried on multiple devices to no avail do not buy in most cases id say you get what you pay for but here it feels like even less than that 
0,i was excited to get mouse that was usb charge instead of batteries ive charged it once and it worked great for about week which is awesome but have been trying to charge it now for days and it will not accept charge im past my return window and cannot get my money back or exchange it for new one this is big bummer 
1,works great and battery lasts long time ve used it everyday since purchased it month or so ago and havent had to charge it many times clicks are very quiet as well and the light setting looks amazing
1,great price headset for what it is 
1,great product
1,i really like very helpful
0,i liked the size and ease of charging but very dissatisfied with the lack of reliability and of course both stopped working just past the point could return waste of money useless without the scrolling wheel 
0,i received the mouse and it worked great for hours but now will not turn on or function at all have tried charging it multiple times with no success very disappointed 
0,if could give stars would paid for same day delivery and showed up days late finally get them and the sound quality is bad and there was loud static coming from the headset
1,i got these for my boyfriend who plays video games on his pc and he absolutely loves these headphones they light up really cool blue when they are on very useful for noise cancellation and the quality of sound is amazing 
0,love it will have to but another one 
0,no depth annoying to listen to 
0,love how it looks and feels but out the box it was really glitchy charged it and saw that it was still sticking bit as was using it since it mouse the one thing it should do is move smoothly ya know don know if this was just this one mouse or it how it runs either way it really annoying when you re trying to get things done 
0,the keys unfortunately are not silent and therefor returning this 
0,stopped working after month the usb adapter also broke
1, like it easy to use and carry around if needed the box comes with nice short charging cord and usb usb adapter for use with either the bluetooth receiver or the charging cord nice addition that come in handy don like how long it takes for it to wake up though not sure what the time frame is on when it goes to sleep but if reading something or just have my computer on for video or music just turn the mouse off all together it quicker to just flick it back on than it is to jiggle it around to wake it rainbow colors are fun holds charge for long time can work pretty much the whole week before noticing its lagging and probably could use charge this makes it lot friendlier to use over batteries ll take the sluggish sleep mode over the clunky mouse styles with repeat battery replacements good find for the money 
1,it was present but feedback is that the sound is excellent
0,stopped working after months what waste 
0,this thing works better than expected so many complaints about the bass but it seems very good for what it is after all it not dj speaker at club had this out for no more than minutes before accidentally dropped it in hot tub panicked at first but then remembered it is waterproof after the water wicked off it kept bumping very impressed so far 
0,thanks
0,this product is worth the costs we have been using this headset frequently for over year and it has performed without any concerns 
0,it felt like cheap product upon arrival and usage after months and no longer charges and is absolutely useless 
1,product is responsive the colors are cool easy to recharge so far pleased with purchase using for work and not gaming 
1,some stuff is okay to cheap out on but wouldn recommend it with this keyboard it worked just fine until it completely stopped holding charge after only months of use if you really want sweet light up key board bite the bullet and spend the money for legit one don waste your time or money 
1,my daughter use it for her laptop an plays few games on it the battery life is fair since she does use the mouse alot say about to hours countulessy
0,failed after three month of use from jan to apr charging is not possible it is too late to exchange do not waste money 
1,i love it bought this for my mom because already have one of this brand so know it has really good sound quality the battery lasts for long and you can be using it while charging and the quality still the same really easy to connect to your phone by the way it only takes few seconds hope you enjoy this product as much as we do 
1,worked great for month mouse connects via usb receiver ve only disconnected the receiver few times when not using the mouse however after disconnecting few times can reconnect the receiver without it being loose the instant my mouse connects it will disconnect because the usb is too loose now after month edit customer service reps have reached out to me offering me money to delete my review 
1,i love how cute this mouse is use it for work it goes into sleep mode pretty quickly but one click and you re back up and running charge it once week 
1,i really like this mouse pretty catchy color rose gold and it maneuvers so gentle and smoothly 
1,i love this jbl speaker it has really good sound and it plays super loud 
1,this mouse is cheap as heck opened it up and it feels and looks like something good buy from dollar tree

1,i am pleasantly pleased with this mouse it attractive looking and works very well it comes with usb adapter along with the charging cable in case you need one plug and play actually worked no complaints about this mouse and would purchase again if need an additional one 
0,i has purchased charge in the past great the charge will not hold charge have followed online instructions to no avail charge engineers fired one and all complete fail recommend you follow my advice and never purchase charge speaker you will only have yourself to blame very disappointed 
0,headphones lasted one week before the sound started cutting out you get what you pay for guess
1,this was gift for my yo son he absolutely loves it
1,these headphones are very comfortable with nice clear sound 
0,crisp sound better than wal mart headsets ve been getting 
1,i ve had many headsets over the years and this one sound quality is right up there with the best of the mid priced headsets however the quality of the outgoing sound from the microphone is horrible have played with the same group of friends and they can barely tolerate the sound of my voice when playing ve tried tweaking the voice settings on my computer and have been unable to fix it when using my old headset there aren any issues other than microphone quality the headset it above average 
1,overall really like the mouse but the scroll button doesn work also was not able to find way to contact the seller to resolve the issue 
1,the wife needed new mouse found this one she said she liked it ordered it she loves it very sleek works perfectly usb charging instead of batteries awesome 
1,really cool keyboard the rainbow lights look awesome like that they turn off on automatically while in use to avoid draining battery faster can speak to how long it stays charged or with what kind of use my keyboard use can be pretty sporadic as it just for personal use and not heavy gaming or regular work use the charging cable is short for my liking prefer to plug it into an adapter and not the computer for efficient charging the feel of the keys is nice they press easily but not too easily typing is quiet the keyboard is very lightweight which is nice for someone like me who moves it to charge it and also put it away when not in use it also fairly compact for full keyboard so it nice it doesn take up much space 
1,i love this little mouse very well built and sturdy dropped it twice and nothing happened to it the colors do not fade fun lighting reliable and very long charging battery life use it almost every day and haven had to charge it in weeks ended up buying another one for my daughter and it just as well made 
1,the quality isn very good on these sound wasn the best either 
0,i used it for my school chrome book and all of sudden it fell of my desk and it broke 
1,just received these headphones days back and so far my son just loves them great gaming headphones and have long wire to be able to plug into different devices
1,first off love the color it what made me purchase it in the first place didn need mouse but like having spare now for my review as far as what used to for comfort this mouse sits flat so be aware of that if you plan on using it for long periods of time fits nicely in your hand have medium small hands so please take that into consideration with the review the lights loved the different light modes it actually made it feel like had gaming mouse while not being so hard on my wallet now for push button response my right click wasn working properly barely clicked down and would sometimes mia click from it being mispositioned had to lift it up to see the issue was the prong was bad broke it off and now it is clicking as intended so please be aware this is all very fragile plastic within its housing overall the mouse is great if you need spare and would buy again if needed another hate out of stars because feels worse than but feel an is more accurate to how feel as it has lot of great features such as charging vs batteries and an included usb adapter overall wonderful product that do recommend
0,it doesn work anymore after month when the return is no longer allowed then it stopped working 
0,it is great the only bad things about it is the point that you can change the rgb color

0,it was nice and sleek it felt very cheaply made though and it died within weeks of having it wouldn turn on even charged it would not recommend buying it 
1,it works feels and sounds like jbl should no complains about mono sound 
1,lightweight comfortable and cool with the lights rechargable is major plus
0,i use the mouse instead of mousepad
0,you get what you pay for this thing is piece of crap 
0,i bought this for working at home general use was sick of my old mouse running out of batteries when didn have any works great for general use and battery lasts while but haven done any button mashing games with it my only complaint is the usb remote plugin fits tight into the underside for storage you have to dig with your nail to remove it small infrequent task but for me if it was corrected its an ideal computer mouse 
1,the pictures are how the product arrived it was packaged in cheap plastic bag and the box was mutated this was supposed to be gift for my son and didn have time to replace it the delivery was late which would have been just fine if it didn arrive like this didn work not sure if it didn work because of the delivery or because of the product do not buy this you will not get what you were expecting 
1,it was great until it stopped working won even turn on charged it of course and still doesn work at all time window to return passed really not what you expect from amazon ll be taking steps to get my money back you can bet on that don care how cheap it was

0,says it works with xbox in the headline and maybe somewhere buried in the description says it needs an adaptor returning immediately 
0,it turns off when using it sometimes
0,is everything had hoped for and more 
1,i have of the jbl go bluetooth speakers that produce tremendous sound quality for such small unit and the portability is the reason bought them recently decided to upgrade to the charge and must say am truly amazed by the incredibly powerful sound quality of this unit don wait buy it today

1,awesome sound and bass
0,the mouse is not large enough and does not hold charge for long 
0,my return date closed days ago and the mouse has stopped working completely 
0,i love that the color changes haven had any problems with it
0,i love this mouse ve ordered two the first one lasted me about year and the second ve received just died on me about eight months after purchase the clicker just stopped working on me 
0,it does it job for the price if you can spend little extra for something better go for it but if need strapped for cash it ll do 
1,stopped working two days after we received them but the customer service is amazing 
1,i guess almost year for under is good enough especially if you want one that recharges because you don like fooling around with aa batteries battery life was good could use it all day with no problems 
1, just live my cordless keyboard and mouse they match my hp desktop computer perfectly 
1,the keyboard is good but wish the battery last longer than couple of days in stead of having to charge it every two days 
1,this is very nice mouse for my needs like how it lights up especially when am using it in the dark which makes it easier to use and appreciate that do not have to buy batteries worth the purchase 
0,excelente
1,i not gonna lie this headset was better than anticipated super happy bought this one looks great and sounds awesome they are sooo comfy to wear its amazing great gaming headset for really good price 
1,it work super great recommend for other to buy
1,i love colorful keyboards even though not gamer when purchased this one was thrilled to see how colorful it was how handy it was to just charge it up and not struggle with cord and find it has long battery life however have had consistent trouble with the layout of the keys the biggest problem have is the enter key when typing constantly getting the instead of the enter key thought would get used to it but haven for over couple of months other keys are little bit off what expect so frequently making typos when using apostrophes etc plan to keep it in reserve but ve ordered logitech keyboard because quite sure the keys will be in the places expect for touch typing 
1,i recently tried to go back to an old pair of headphones and found them to be lacking so opted to buy second pair of these since had used them before and enjoyed them after side by side comparison these headphones are more comfortable have much higher audio quality and overall feel like they have better build quality than other headphones ve used if you re looking for great product that looks good and for lower price than high end ones buy these you certainly won regret it 
0,people are right this is rip off waste of money it only worked for week wow
0,title says it all one of the shift keys and the caps lock stopped working after only months don bother 
0,the sound only comes through on one side and it not very loud

0,this keyboard is great to type on and is comfy to use the lack of colour modes make it seam less appealing
1,they are wonderful just one thing though everyone on the receiving end can hear everything going on around you 
0,excelente
0,this has less sound outputand quality than jbl flip extremely disappointed with this model it mono and if the jbl logo isn pointing in your exact direction you don get much sound don even bother with the hassle of trying this did it for you 
0,the key board has very cheap construction it has major hardware flaw where ctrl shift keyboard combinations do not function properly from the left side of the keyboard it is much smaller than my previous logitech wireless keyboard that broke the cord it comes with is way too short so had to spend another buying longer cord the rgb lighting effects are very sub par they don stay on continuously and only have one alternate effect of breathing otherwise the color effect is stationary and never moves the keyboard is so light if wants to slide when using it so you might also have to buy keyboard pad next time think ll spend and extra for better ergonomic quality gaming keyboard 
0,the mouse scrolled only worked for one day then stopped everything else works and lights are very pretty
0,the description says that it is adapter for macbook air this is not true you have to plug adapter into laptop and then the usb wireless tab into the adapter had know had to use an adapter would not have bought this can not return as need it now very disappointed 
1,after hours of youtube reviews and black friday cyber sale decided to go with this large awkward speaker with only decent battery life and ok sound quality know now for fact that the bose is way better the charge distorts at about of max volume and doesnt have the bass like that of smaller devices just because you add some flexy vibrating cones on the ends doesnt mean there will be better bass 
0,review after months use liked the mouse lot it was rechargeable cool with lights but it suddenly stopped working after months very disappointed 
1,works great
1,the audio quality and fit are pretty nice however key feature needed was mic built into the headset the gain on the mic is maybe making it completely inaudible loud blowing into the mic brings it up to an audible level on playback but far from normal interaction when conversing will continue to use my very old logitech mic which is far superior in audio capture 
0,worked beautifully for month and then the roller ball broke guess you get what you pay for 
0,it stopped working after months
0,very good headset
1,no complaints with this purchase slim design makes it easy to pack and go
1,great video game headset love how it has the adjustable speak in microphone now players can actually hear me

1,this mouse was great for about two months then it stopped charging and won work don waste your money 
1,prettiest mouse ve ever had 
1,i used this guy for dayssssss upon receiving without charging few times ve had thought had issues with the mouse but had it backwards that my main complaint too easy to put backwards it doesn attract dust and dirt works on every surface ve put it on and it cute
1,this mouse is awesome it charges quickly and comes with an adapter for the new apple mac plug thing hated my other dell mouse and this one is so smooth quick to react and quiet never thought it would make difference but my students can not hear my annoying clicking anymore recommend 
1,the mouse is super sleek and comfortable for people who like their hands more flat super pretty when all lit up and works perfectly but you better not drop it or drop anything you re carrying it in because it instantly will stop working every minutes you use it there after should have expected this from such cheap mouse but after one minor drop is ridiculous 
0,the mouse cursor jumps around and doesn stay where it supposed to 
1,the sound quality is extraordinary and the battery life is also great
1,bought as gift she loved it 
0,i admit that might have overused it since bought it for my work from home but my sis got similar one which is why bought this one and that one actually lasts days without the need of chargei needed to charge this one multiple times on the day and at one point it just wouldn work even while plugged in so still needed to switch to the old oneit is really disappointing idk if got faulty product or if that is actually the extent of its productivity
1,works great for playing video games

1,perfect for work used days without charging 
0,tried on multiple surface and no matter what do the pointer is erratic it also never goes into sleep mode if you fail to turn it off you will run through the battery in day awful tried to click on the seller name in an effort to contact them directly but it was grayed out very disappointed

0,my lives them can hear me when call for him lol
0,it works for now will see after some time 
1,it worked great it would get little slow when it needed charging but all of sudden it won come on even after charging 
0,i bought this item few weeks ago and it was disappointing to find out the battery does not even last min at full volume but the worst part is that even if plugged to the charger the battery will die if speaker is in use which will cause for it to shut off 
1,if like me your hat size is in the giant section these will work slide on and off easily without compromising sound 
1,i purchased this gaming headset to that could work on my computer and play skyrim while my wife watched our television in the next room my wife loved the led lights on the headset loved the great sound and noise cancellation

1,mine came in the wrong color but regardless they are still pretty good headphones guess you just have to talk loud into them kinda
1,definitely worth it
0,everyone in my family is impressed by the sound quality for such little speaker 
1,mouse works fine and the grandkids love them they mainly use them for school work and for gaming 
1,the wired mouse ve been using at work was driving me insane with its loud clicking noises love the convenience of this one being wireless so it easy to use with my desktop or laptop it super easy to install and while the buttons aren completely silent they are significantly more quiet than your average mouse the colorful leds are fun but it not feature ll be using lot so far ve had no issues with connectivity or responsiveness at all certainly recommend this mouse at this price point 
1,it sounds lot more boosted than most of the jbl fast shipment and definitely worth the money it came well packaged and no damage from the looks and sound of it will update after couple months to give its life durability and charging device
0,smol

0,worked for less than month it won charge real piece of junk not great product 
1,this is great standalone bluetooth speaker unfortunately jbl connect is wildly unpredictable so if you want to connect multiple compatible jbl speakers using this technology you will experience lots of dropouts of one or the other of the speakers it very frustrating otherwise the sound is great battery life is superb etc use it while camping quite lot and it gets me through multiple days of normal use without even considering recharge 
1,the mouse definitely makes difference when it comes to the clicking sound everyone is glad there is no more of that it slim rechargeable and decent looking 
1,works great good sound quality everything came packaged well had no problems definitely worth the price paid 
1,this mouse has low profile which fits my hand perfectly the point glides smoothly over the screen haven seen any difference in pointer speed between the three dpi settings but it doesn matter because it is fast enough can say enough good things about the fact that this mouse is rechargeable but have been using it daily for about week and it shows no sign of running down or needing recharging the kaleidoscope effect of changing colors is cool makes me want to turn out the lights and use the computer in darkened room would definitely recommend this mouse

1,awesome
0,the aux cable broke off inside the controller had to pick it out piece by piece normal use this should have remained intact with basic gaming 
0,sounds is decent can hear other crisp and clear if you want the lights to work plug in the usb long cable so you aren tied so close to your device controller 
1,these are very good for the low price tag my son loves them 
0,they didn light up disappointing for my little guy 
0,fully charged would work with the mouse for hour minutes and then it would lag and hardly move or not move at all fully charged kept having to switch usb ports to get it working again which worked sometimes but then it again would get stuck lag or stop working have the latest mac software what don have is time for this mouse returned it bought another wireless usb mouse from another company that works perfectly 
1,just got this last night for my new acer when plugged in the mouse the curser just jumps around with usb or usb plug it zig zags across the screen when trying to move in straight line it stops just short of moving to the edges of the screen and you have to move it gently to get it to go anywhere with precision charged it overnight and same results this morning adjusted the dpi with the button and it just jumps faster around the screen tried troubleshooting but can use any other mouse in my house and they work just fine so will be returning this mouse and purchasing something that works 
0,my first concern is that it does not give you warning when it needs recharging it just dies out if you are using your usb for something else you have to stop what you are doing to plug in the mouse second the charge does not last long very frustrating and now the most important it died just stopped working oh well so much for fancy going back to battery operated mouse 
1,sone loves it

0,nice mouse but would not charge after single use tried with the usb on the computer other usb chargers even switched their cord out 
0,i surprised how highly rated this keyboard is given that the space bar isn quiet as advertised this isn manufacturing defect it the actual design besides that problem the enter key is whole key further away compared to most keyboards found myself repeatedly pressing where the key should be but that place is occupied by the backslash another problem is that in ubuntu the keyboard shortcut for create new folder doesn work on this keyboard 
1,very nice my son loves them 
0,worth it
0,trash bought it to play final fantasy which working dad so don get to play too much it spends most of its time on the dresser plugged in to ps left it on few times and now it stopped working all together buy at your own risk 
1,i ordered two pairs of these headphones one for me and another for my brother not even two weeks and they ve already ran their course at first they were bit tight on the head enough to give headaches if not removed after few hours this eventually eased up as the first week went on the real issue came in for us days after first using them like many others have been saying here one day the mic was fine and the next day all of sudden its quality was way lower than what it was prior audio then coming through lot more stuffy and the mic having hard time picking up any sounds at all only when cranked up the decibel settings to max it was able to pick up feint sounds one of them still works fine on our xbox but when it comes to pc they re both on the way out already will most definitely be looking elsewhere for our tech needs in the future 
1,the headset is comfortable the sound is great quality 
1,nice speaker good range for bluetooth connection can go good ways away and it still works 
1,i used this for gaming and it pretty awesome the noises hear when playing games like apex are outstanding
0,this mouse didn last month the buttons broke and the seller will not replace it waste of money do not buy
0,sound reflects lot don be fooled by the image
0, year old grandson is thrilled with the speaker and he has more discerning music ear 
0,the things hate about this keyboard were mentioned in the reviews but overlooked them this product is not made in the usa even though there is an american flag displayed suggesting it is the supplied cable is only feet long and does not insert fully into the keyboard so factor in the price of foot cable that does insert as had to do finally the keyboard lights time out after minute of non use even if you leave it plugged in and battery life is not an issue 
0,update seller realized left star review and is now spamming me with gift card bribes to remove it if you are wondering how product with so many bad reviews somehow has over star rating it because they bribe buyers with gift cards to delete bad reviews or change them to stars original review purchased bengoo but the headset came in butfulake gh box pics attached no user manual included my mousepad came with more troubleshooting instructions for some reason gaming headset needed both usb plug and an audio jack good ones only need usb my windows pc didn recognize the usb when plugged in all other usb headsets in my household work fine with the same pc the blue ear lights go on but no audio or microphone available apparently you have to use the audio jack to make the sound work but still no working microphone with non functioning usb plug someone clearly tried to pass off their broken leftovers as new no idea how this seller and product became an amazon choice with strong customer ratings very scammy experience serves me right for trying to go cheap on electronics already started the return process 
1,my son is rough on headsets so this is great headset for him without being too expensive they are really durable and the sound quality is really nice 
1, wish would have seen the video from another reviewer with the white mouse before purchased the white one don like the fact that the light is visible throughout the whole mouse assumed it would just be line of light that circles the mouse as shown in the sellers pictures if you like the look of the whole mouse lighting up as shown in the video then this is the mouse for you overall do like the mouse and don want to deal with exchanging planned on getting the mint and should have gone with my instincts it glides smoothly and the clicks are slient won be returning it because do like it but just diappointed the white one was not as shown described
0,i liked this product until is stopped working months later 
1,you can turn off the colors it lights up the entire time you re using it bought the white mouse of this brand and love that one
0,i had the mouse charging all weekend when returned to work monday morning smelled something hot but no one else smelled anything went to unplug my mouse and my cord was so hot couldn even touch it the entire cord melted and the wires had burned through the rubber coating very easily could have caught my computer on fire do not buy this mouse unless you have great fire insurance 
0,the mouse does not hold charge it goes dead within hours 
0,my fianc got me this as birthday gift and of course now just outside of the return window my mic doesn work so no one can hear me when we playing together and the headset doesn light up either very disappointed as now have headset that serves no purpose to me and can return 
0,or should say worked well it stopped working after like weeks 
1,the one currently using has been dropped number of times is currently wrapped with scotch tape wanted new one in the event the older one gives up quits on me and with this newer sleeker one it has splace for the usb connector to be stored for travel purposes on the underside of the mouse another great feature think

1,i love that do not need batteries it recharges fairly quick slim design fits my had perfectly also love can turn it off

0,the mic is too soft and my friends say sound muffled all the time its worse than the mic previously had and wish could get refund but don know have the time to do returns since am traveling around now messed with my sound settings to try and increase the volume but it didn change anything 
1,i am not using it for gaming but think its cute and love the colors just wish it was little bighter 
0,loved it while it worked yet here we are two months later and it literally just stopped working ve tried multiple usb ports to no avail guess you get what you pay for
0,these headphones were comfortable had great quality sound and was convenient what didn like however is that you cannot change the cable on the headset after couple of months the wire that connects to the audio jack was so weak it stops working would keep using these headphones if it wasn for the fact that you cannot ever change the cable if it gets damaged 
1,great product already own wired version of this exact keyboard was so happy with it bought the wireless version both keyboards are in use today and wonderful don hesitate this is the keyboard for you 
0,great if you re looking for cheap headset the sound quality and audio is poor however 
1,my husband loves these 
1,work perfect for my year old great sound mic is easy to move use they don feel or look cheap which is great for kids since they don break the bank either definitely recommend

0,i have now purchased two jbl bluetooth speakers wrote to jbl about the first one not holding charge for even half of the advertised time never heard back my second purchase does not hold charge for half the time advertised either my jbl flip purchased from amazon in july have only ever held hour charge it supposed to hold charge for hours reluctantly purchased another one but figured my flip was dud have friends that say their charges hold charges for long time jbl charge from amazon in april my charge only hold charge for about hours it supposed to hold charge up to hours the fact that these speakers do not hold charger for as long as they are supposed defeats the purpose can use them on trips or in the woods like should be able to as they need to be charged frequently bring my charge outside when garden and it dies before my day is over and have to connect it to power source was wondering why my charge didn sound as good or was as loud as some had heard before and now realize it because it not built the same as the charge 
1, love this speaker going to buy second one so can pair them together
0,comfort
1,i like the headphones unfortunately the wire was too short for the lights to be plugged in to the usb port and the controller on my ps the usb plugin for the lights was about long and the rest of the cord was longer but the sound was great do have to keep one side off my ear because need to be able to hear other things in the house definitely comfortable 
1,my son loves this headset it was his favorite birthday gift he uses it everyday to communicate with other online gamers this has been his only source of socializing with other kids since the pandemic started it quality headset for great price he has destroyed all other headsets but this one very satisfied with this purchase just know that it only lights up when playing on pc not xbox or playstation my son doesn care though 
1,lot of good sound quality from little size perfect fit in my bike beach basket 
0,could not get product to work and the cord was too long

0,the headset was nice lookin but stopped working after days
1,this is the first day of use but the mouse looks nice got flat black like that there are no batteries charged quickly and super easy to start using its light and fits my small hand nicely the lights are nice as well and not annoying like that they can be turned off don plan on using the mouse for gaming so will not know how well it works for that sort of thing for me just basic computer work photoshop lightroom and think it will do nicely for those it seems quick and is working well even without mouse pad think it was for sure worth the price so far its nice basic mouse think 
0,highly recommended
1,its pretty much good 
1,the mouse is very easy to use and automatically connected to the computer would definitely recommend this mouse to others 
1,i have always wanted the charge after purchasing the flip now that have it love the sound can connect it with the other flip in party mode and it great can also connect thru bluetooth my laptop audio which is great for zoom meeting and streaming it great product and don feel it will disappoint 
1,i love this mouse it quiet and pretty and the battery lasts while probably charge it once maybe twice week
1,had to go through few important settings for it to work didn work off the bat but its good once figured all that out 
0,looks good however whoever designed the wiring needs to fix it spliter is short to have usb plugged into rear of ps to use lights 
1,the mic is really good teammates can hear me perfectly and video game noises are really good quality for the price the noise cancellation is unbelievable
1,its great good sound quality and style 
0,very bulky and the sound quality for what you get is not worth the price returned mine for the flip which has little less bass but ultimately it is relatively close to the same sound for less
1,i am just low key kinda gamer don have lot of money or fancy set up just fan for my gaming laptop and these they match which is really cool see photo have no complaints asked guy on roblox vc how sounded on scale from and he said if you are like me or have kids who also play games similar to me such as roblox or elite dangerous or just have general steam discord needs then would recommend this headset although its plastic it doesn feel low quality or cheap feels well made and sturdy ve dropped this think like times already and also stepped on and by mistake yanked on the cord it still working great though also the volume control and mic on and off buttons all work fine if you don game for living but want something that finally isnt junk but aren rich this in my opinion is your solution

0,it was sleek and nice looking mouse but the usb got annoying and broke easily

1,this mouse is great for what use it for like the rgb effects not really designed for gaming
1,i bought this mouse to replace one that had the mousewheel break to be honest loved this mouse at first the lights the feel everything however was not fan of the extra added adapter to make it usb compatible here am months after bought it and the mousewheel no longer functions on this mouse as well for some reason the companies that make these portable mouse mice cannot make one that has sturdy mouse wheel oddly enough the one thing didn like about the mouse originally became my favorite thing now that it is broken the adapter to allow me to run regular usb on usb port 
1,the sound is really good it connects to bluetooth quickly and is extremely portable love it and recommend it 
1,best headset ever noise cancellation and sound quality are awesome

1,good fit good sound purchased on sale worth it 
1,my son loves his headset would definitely order again he can hear clearly and is heard clearly 
0,the headset is nice but the cord on the actual product is different from the instructions there are two jacks one for the game controller and usb connection to power the lights if you look at the pictures the split is further down closer to the jacks than what is explained in the instructions doubt anyone would be able to use the lights unless they re sitting next to an outlet also there isn much room to use the controller if the usb is connected to power source poor design of the cord 
0,i like the items just want them to send me one that actually works but after nd one they don have that option so guess ll buy different brand that all works not just some

1,it great for the price point very impressed but the range is so short for the wireless one only ft away to play games on my tv and it doesn connect or the input is laggy
1,it fits my hand and the light show is cool 
0,i got this product for my grandson birthday too play video games 
0,bonito
0,it allows you to hear outside noise if there no audio coming through but with audio coming through it drowns out other noise very comfortable 
0,it extremely uncomfortable to use maybe if you re on trip and need something to do the job this will work definitely not for daily use gaming or work 
0,works as expected 
1,i was debating between this speaker and the ultimate ears megaboom my friend actually bought the ue megaboom at the same time bought the jbl charge can say this speaker has more bass and is louder in volume prefer the directional speakers on this there is front where sound is clearer and louder and back don love how there isn strap or loop or something to grip but did buy really cool silicone case for that has strap and doesn alter the sound 
0,there is just so much to dislike about this keyboard now that have used it for awhile first there is no indication of battery status second the on time before the lights turn off when inactive is too brief and not adjustable third the battery life is very short so it easiest just to leave it plugged in which defeats the purpose fourth the action keys for sound don connect to the computer and are therefore worthless fifth it is obnoxious that there is little divot in the enter key and the key is tucked in there it is far too easy to hit the backslash when you think you are hitting enter sixth it is cheaply made and feels flimsy am ordering from someone else and will gladly dump this one in the trash 
1,i used this product as gaming headset and is by far the best headset have bought 
0,worse sound than the charge 
1,just love it well worth the money 
0,i use for work only last about hours battery not like it specifies
1,i picked this up so could play the xbox games via the mobile cloud app they provide use this headset with my one controller via the plug to play the games enjoy and talk on chat playing my online games the headset fits wonderfully on my ears not too tight not loose however the ear coverings do not cancel out the noise as my other set does at home since this is an on the go out in the public headset consider this good thing as it lets me hear the close things happening around me and such the headset is light enough to not feel like giant weight on my head and feels sturdy enough to be durable for packing around in messenger bag with my phone and controller have thick vinal bag when traveling keep these in to keep them from getting damaged or dirty the sound is adequate on these don expect phenomenal quality sound like high priced headset the audio is clear and directional based on input from the games and such so can know what direction my team and enemies are in with that being said the glow feature really isn necessary but is very bright and attention getting when plugged into usb port which just runs the led lights in the earphones the bright blue would look really good on live stream or lets play if you do that sort of thing for the price paid hope these hold up with the constant going and moving around that do through the week ll come back when if they finally break fail to finish this review up and give input into the durability 
1,my son loves these especially the fact that they light up 
0,i used it in warehouse while we were assembling christmas food boxes for families in need and it made that christmas music fill the whole warehouse 
1,works perfectly for work computer
1,the keyboard works fine and the lights are pretty cool but the cable that connects it to the computer is not working it doesn fit anything usb is like there something stuck or damaged inside 
0,it was not eyeglasses friendly and caused headache after an hour 
0,i purchased this mouse on march all of sudden the mouse just don want to move in the directions need it to each time move the mouse to different templates or screens it move then pause then move little and pause again would not recommend the mouse to anyone worst mouse ve ever purchased 
0,broke after weeks of having it 
1,when first got the item the color looked off ordered the blue but fairly positive based on the images was sent mint green liked the quiet button clicks and it was nice to have in college classes for bit because it was so quiet however after only week and half the mouse wheel stopped working could feel the tension in the wheel was gone so opened it to investigate and it looked like there was small plastic rod that rotated with the wheel but the contact point between the rod and wheel was broken so it wouldn work anymore liked the aesthetics of it except for the red led used for the tracking would also overpower the rgb lights it bothered me but that didn affect the function wish this had worked better 
0,good gaming headphone for the price 
1,i bought this for my brother and tried it out before gave it to him it has amazing sound quality almost kept it for myself 
0,not good at all but did pay cheap for it uncomfortable sound is not that good and short mic wouldn buy again 
1,i purchased this to replace broken battery operated cordless mouse think dropped it one too many times thought would give this rechargeable mouse try hope that won have to recharge it too often only had to do the initial charge so far and do lot of clicking also chose this one for its flatter design my other one was higher and after using it long time my hand got stiff maybe this one won do that so far it hasn 
1,it good but for gaming don recommend this slim one it ok for normal work 
1,better then set highly recommend 
1, so far so good had previous mouse that gave out after months and check the cool colors 
0,convenient and quiet mouse
0,i ve had this for month and half it stopped working ve tried charging repeatedly and it does nothing 
0,not working after months of use
1,great quality sound and long lasting battery 
0,it broke the mouse is unresponsive the wheel is isolated it is inconvenient having to charge the mouse every few uses through cable it 
1,i love that it rechargeable and you don need batteries 
1,i initially liked this mouse because it cute it too flat to be ergonomic but that was okay except ve used it for less than month and the scroll wheel has fallen off its track it also dies very fast and needs to be recharged often don recommend it for anyone using mouse regularly 
1,this speaker rocks you will not be disappointed perfect size charge last all day even at max volume jbl procts are the best 
1,this is our second purchase my son likes it alot the first one the mic went out due to he kept putting it in his mouth great headset for the money 
0,the sound isn as good as had hoped but the awful range of the bluetooth was the absolute deal breaker fully charged it can keep solid bluetooth connection to my computer that literally feet across the living room it breaks up so bad that it was unbearable to listen to wondering if the problem was actually my computer switched to little jbl clip that have and it worked flawlessly the charge was total failure and is being returned to best buy 
1,great product excellent sound 
1,update may the speaker started crackling and became unusable fortunately it was still under warranty and jbl was very responsive in handling the return and repair just hope it lasts this is my second jbl bluetooth speaker also have the charge which am very happy with however after years the battery no longer holds charge the charge has excellent sound quality at the high mid and low ranges bought both the charge and ue megaboom for comparison purposes no contest jbl was the superior speaker for sound in my opinion the ue speaker wins for features as it comes with great app that allows for more customized sound and user experience sound quality is what care about most so kept the jbl and returned the ue 
1,i think it very good and affordable ve owned this for few months and have no complaints tbh
1,great wireless mouse the instructions were easy to follow the only thing wish it did was glow red when it needs recharging will probably purchase another one when this one dies 
1,i don like using my mouse on my laptop so having mouse is helpful and then it lights up 
1,it very comfortable headset that can play with for hours without feeling uncomfortable it very light and the cable is long which really value lot the led lights are nice touch when playing at nighttime or just wanna show off really enjoy the solid quality 
1,this is great wireless mouse at great price it comes with usb charger and quickly connected to my laptop it feels great on my palm and the cursor moves around the screen smoothly love the ability to change the mouse lighting and love how lightweight but durable it is 
0,i use for music
0,very cheap quality the lights don look like the photo it just changes from one color to another and never looks rainbow like in the photos also buttons are not silent 
0,bought this mouse in march and today it stopped working it will not charge and is now useless 
1,they do the job for sure but then you can expect it because of the price but for the price they are nice
1,i used this for my security system and works very good easy to set up
1,this headset works great it cancels out background sound and the mic sounds great 
0,really loud and clear sound
1,i recently picked up new computer and needed new mouse one that would fit the bill for my work editing video it needed to be light ergonomic and move well with sensitivity also work in low light and the led light on the mouse is nice touch the led is certainly not an essential feature but it definitely adds nice look to the product and for me is very appealing this mouse has been great all around recommend this product edit initially loved this mouse however its ability to maintain charge dramatically decreased in short order it can no longer keep charge for more than an hour or so the mouse has essentially become useless this is quite disappointment after initially enjoying the other qualities of this mouse 
1,the keys are responsive and the multi colored back lighting is an attractive feature the rechargeable battery lasts long time and charges very quickly though had small issue klim customer service was really very helpful heartily recommend this keyboard 
0,works great has lasted longer than most but still less expensive 
0,beware this mouse did not hold up it wouldn charge correctly after week had to return 
0,it was good mouse while it lasted but died on me suddenly months after purchasing purchased and died

0,gaming
1,i bought this for home office and liked it so much bought second one for work to use instead of what the company supplied to me it everything the description says it is very comfortable too 
1,love the product will probably order another color 
0,item as described
1,great sound quality great product within the price range
0,everything
0,i like the compact shape and the changing light bar around it 
0,i acknowledge that this isn the loudest speaker jbl has to offer but with that being said let me just say that for the size of this thing there is no better speaker available period 
0,the device looks and feels good the left clicker is very sensitive and mandates that under normal use you keep your hand off of the top of the mouse on the left side or you will accidently left click the coloring is good looking but it is difficult to determine when you need to recharge the short charging cord connects to the computer so you must leave the computer on while recharging the mouse which is inconvenient but the control of the curser is good although occasionally it seems to jump to different place on the screen still not sure why that happens but it is decent value for the money once you teach yourself it quirks 
0,the mouse started off great even got two one for me and one for my son they both failed about the same time it charges for hours and then when switch it on it has double red blink and does not react same thing when plugged in 
0,this mouse worked perfectly for about months almost on the month mark exactly the scroll wheel stopped working it just spins and doesn move the cursor up and down the page looked to see if could return but the window closed month ago don be tempted by the cheap price should have stuck to name brand 
0,it nice mouse

1,grandson loves it he has no complaints and uses it with his xbox

1,nice headset with very long cable works great solid product
1,as the title suggest it stopped working after week of use really liked the feel and look of the mouse so was pretty happy with it until today when it stopped working do not recommend 
1,the item is actually nice the size color and lights are very cute and love that is rechargeable the only issue encounter was that when you leave it idle for few seconds and then try to use it it gets super slow and lags have to turn it off and back on to have the speed back to normal don know if that is feature to save power or if mine is defective ll try to reach out to the seller has anyone else experienced this issue 
1,just got new macbook it works well with it good quality for the price

1,great 
0,no problems at all so far cord can get in the way at times and it in an awkward position for me but it is wired headset 
1,so far so good
1,just received the headset sound looks good think its worth the price 
1,the mouse is sturdy and the rainbow lighting feature is fun it auto shuts off after minutes think which is great for saving the battery thought that having to put it on charger would be major inconvenience it not at all the recharge is quick and only do it once week so far 
0,dead in weeks
0,first and foremost have had this keyboard almost year now the first keyboard received was doa which anyone who knows much about electronics knows that that is just how it is sometimes contacted their customer support and within week had new keyboard initially this was amazing and saw no issues but as time went on it stopped charging properly believe am on my computer long hours every day as work from home and then game at night if charge it at night with the keyboard set to off it lasts the whole day normally even then sometimes it doesn but overall it does other times even while it is plugged in it shuts off randomly making gaming hard if klim were reading this would suggest two things add some way to show battery charge on the keyboard and upgrade the battery stability this keyboard after year is acting like the one that was faulty did just year later for those who are reading this would suggest this keyboard unless you use it hours day it simply isn built for that it feels like 
0,the product is as shown in the picture
1,perfect fo my sons video games comfy to wear 
1,it is nice mouse and liked that it came with an adapter for the macbook however the adapter did not work which made the mouse unusable the adapter seems flimsy and cheap luckily had an adapter and the mouse now works fine if you are buying this for mac would recommend investing in good adapter 
1,no batteries needed this works great and it lites up too easy to charge and use no problems at all 
1,good sound quality but the mic is little quiet and ended up with short in the wire very quickly shows me as always talking and my friends say there low pitch buzz always coming from the mic 
0,just didn work for me could not plug into my chromebook 
1,fantastic sound quality and simple to operate it fantastic audio experience in package not much bigger than bottle of water 
1,super functional if you want medium portable speaker with very good sound this is perfect sounds really good if you want more volumen you may look for big one 
0,the technology is great but ergonomic it is not
1,new outcome had issues with my st keyboard reached out to the seller and they helped me troubleshoot my device until we figured it needed to be replaced they gladly sent me new keyboard which is now working as expected will definitely recommend this brand old review this keyboard is rechargable and does not have an option fir batteries it worked for month and half it doesnt hold charge mine diesn work at all wasted and now need to buy another keyboard 
0,the headphones are made for children heads the earpieces don cover an adult ears the plastic and shape of the headset itself feels cheap and breakable the microphone quality is atrocious and makes anyone speaking through it sound like the stereotypical kid screaming into mic on fortnite 
0,well thought it would be clever to buy two of these and rotate them however not only do they not maintain charge while turned off literally have to charge both after one dies and it not like these things last that long so that pathetic but also when fully charged and following the troubleshooting the mouse still will just flash red and not work got rd to replace the nd but that one was just as bad they are all bad this is waste of money you re better off dealing with batteries than these cheap wasteful electronic items that will just end up in the landfill anyway please don buy because you will be happy with it right until the return window closes 
1,i bought this for my surface go and it didn work properly and instead of returning it thought would take it to work finally did so today shame on me for not doing it earlier because it still isn working and now it too late to return it it feels great and the lights are fun just make sure you re happy before the return window closes 
1,so if you re looking for top of the line gaming headphones these aren it but they look really cool and sound pretty good you can beat the price 
1,bought this for my fianc for christmas ordered the navy blue one was greatly surprised how wonderful the sound quality was plus it has good bass for smaller speaker it actually pretty loud we never really have to turn it all the way up inside the house my fianc loves that he can charge his phone with it also would purchase again 
0,bought this to go with my pc back in march after about months some of the keys lag out or do not function at all 
1,i really loved this mouse did not replace it with the same mouse however because the wheel broke only use this device for work not gamer or anything like that ve had wireless mice that do not break for years previously great color very cool looking will miss using this not sure if there is any warranty

1,it bit bulky but find hear clearly like that it has volume button have it for months now and it hasn broken yet although it does feel bit wobbly like it could break if you re not caref with it the microphone could be longer so others can hear you more clearly
0,there are multiple times the keyboard does not register my keystrokes causing typos in word processing and issues when gaming defeats the purpose of having keyboard imo it looks nice though 
1,i love the new headset ve gotten so much better of everything definitely recommend this product 
1,in short you get what you pay fori am currently traveling and needed cheap mouse could use this one definitely does the trick and looks nice with the colors on the side but also has couple downsides the dpi change button doesn work on mac the colors at the border aren really bright and even the red light of the sensor always shines through it also is bit small if you have big hands which is upset if you re traveling since it will fit in small spaces in general it is good mouse if you do not want to spend lot of money but there are things that could be better if you want to spend bit more 
0,pure junk
0,came with big gash in it 
1,excellent bluetooth speaker well built and also great sound quality links to harman kardon speakers and also other jbl speakers definitely recommend purchasing if you re looking for great sounding long lasting battery bluetooth speaker 
1,sound is awesome and it pairs well with devices
0,i have purchased this mouse twice and each time it has phased out on me after about months of use it stopped holding charge and cold only use it while it was plugged in which defeats the meaning of wireless then it completely went out on me and can no longer use the mouse at all even when it is on the charging cable have gone through the customer reviews looking for fixes and nothing update now being offered money to remove my comment no will not can care less about my money back want what paid for and refund shouldn be contigent upon removing my comment again don buy 
1,i used this in my first gaming pc setup and for the price it is very high quality it is comfortable to wear and the sound quality is pretty good the microphone quality is also pretty good for cheap gaming headset would recommend

0,son says he likes it 
1,omg love this mouse it works great with my laptop just plug in the little key into the usb port and hello really like that it rechargeable so saving ton on batteries can use it while it charging though the clicks are very quiet so don annoy even myself with the noise and love looking at it because of the colors added of course you can turn off the pulsing colors to save charge but who would want to unless you needed to also it bit small good for travel and fits woman hand if you re man this mouse may be bit too small even if it looks cool for gaming as much as use my hp laptop this mouse is must christa

0,cheap flimsy components and the charge lasts about minutes 
1,works great color just like into the picture the best thing is that it charge last for very long time don have to charge it everyday 
1,considering it keyboard and the title indicates long lasting rechargeable battery you expect the charge to last little longer the fancy glow lights obviously drain it faster than you expect it gives you no warning when the charge is low just quits and you have to plug it in otherwise it is keyboard the lights are cool bought this for the cordless factor after it charged but it the star feeling not bad not great it fine 
1,i love this mouse it smooth quiet and holds the charge so glad purchased it 
0,i really like this mouse 
0,after only months my mouse no longer works am so upset because loveddddd this mouse it slim and fits in my laptop bag easily and everything it checked off everything on my list but no matter how long charge it now it will flash and stop working so sad and now the return window has passed and now can even return it 
0,just what my son wanted 
0,the mouse no matter how much charge it no longer turns on or connects to my computer normally try to avoid making negative reviews but this is honestly not worth the money spent on this all wanted was mouse to help me work on my macbook and this was just huge disappointment

1,great keyboard for the price really like the feel of the keys not used to the enter key yet having notch out where the key is but not big deal also wish it had dedicated volume keys as well as opposed to pressing the fn key first 
0,this is the worst wireless mouse ve ever had the displeasure of using bought it thinking how bad can it really be it just needs to connect to my laptop well if this could be negative star rating would do it if you stop moving the mouse for seconds or more you have to turn it off and then turn it back on again because it loses its tracking and doesn respond to your movements it doesn have any accuracy while clicking things and its uncomfortable to use it is garbage 
0,product is sub par so many things bad is that enough for me to submit it terrible don buy it sound quality bluetooth and battery life sucks did mention all your recommendations that an honest review don buy this product 
1,best purchase ever ve never heard of rechargeable mouse love the light color changing feature which is bonus this is must buy 
0,it worked for the first hour bought it went to charge it it no longer works turns on or charges 
0,works well
0,white button spin wheel broke months later too late to return 
0,the sound quality is not that good used it couple of time and felt like either it is faulty or it just the sound quality of charge is not good 
1,item worked fine for months and then no longer would turn on and yes it was fully charged of course it was past the return date so its basically junk save your money and buy name brand
1,my son loves his speaker it goes everywhere with him 
0,came and broke writhing one day it was dropped one foot and broke 
1,update received my free headset for leaving comment and review and its awesome would definitely recommend doing so if you want free headset it looks good and easy to use no complications and comes with adapter for pc really like them so far only down fall is when using for playstation or any aux plug the headset does not light up only lights when using usb 
0,i like idea of not needing batteries but needs approvements 
0,not really worth it since the extra wires get in the way if your buying for xbox or playstation it terrible because not only do the lights not work but you need to plug the usb into your consol without plug for the usb it just gets extremely annoying to use the sound quality okay for the price 
0,its nice long lasting portable speaker 
1,very cool my year old son loves it he changes the colors and even turns the color off 
0,as soon as took this out of the box knew that was probably going to be sending it back it looks nice in the picture but it is piece of cheap plastic it felt so cheap that just couldn even use it sent it right back

0,worked amazing just as advertised but after month it has not been working anymore it not charging little blue light appears and then it dies when it charging thus the cursor works for few mins and then dies it really not charging anymore so disappointed 
1,i needed new mouse because the one had been using was so old and was unreliable this new one is so nice for such great price it fits my hand comfortably and has super quiet clicks which is super nice it charges instead of using batteries which is feature that love so excited to keep using this product 
1,best speakersout there
1,works great no problems so far lights up nicely 
1,i will be returning this overall it fine but isn what need if you aren fast typer and don use the ctrl and other functions like it it will be good for you there is lag in the keys and frequently have to retype words because it misses letters as type it also has to be in direct sight of the usb otherwise it doesn work the ctrl and other functions like it do not work and use these frequently they also for some reason redesigned the keyboard so the backslash is where the enter key usually is and the enter key is farther away have small hands as it is so cannot reach the enter key without picking up my hand which in inconvenient when doing things like typing an essay finally more of an aesthetic thing than anything do not like that the backlighting turns off without use the colors are pretty but want them to stay on so can still see the keyboard could understand it turning off after something like five or ten minutes of inactivity but it turns off after few seconds liked the idea of this keyboard but it just won work for me it lightweight the colors are nice the clack of the keys is the perfect volume and like that it has battery light but there are too many cons for me to keep it 
0,i had to return this because it did not connect and the signal was constantly lost finally got my money back after weeks 
0,update the mic no longer works after months and there is no product support 
1,i purchased this mouse back in june of this year it is now october the battery life is soo powerful the color changing is the best experience could have ha with mouse can believe how happy am with this purchase 
1,this headset is pretty darn great however feel like the volume cap could stand to be bit higher other than that like it 
1,i ordered the charge as wanted speaker with little more volume and punch and compared to my jbl flip the flip beats this larger speaker hands down the sound quality is good on this charge battery life is very good and it does have fair volume just not what expected took the charge camping and set it up on table at our camp trailer went out to the camp fire people asked me to turn it up some when explained it was at max volume they were surprised luckily brought my jbl flip and it performed much better even though it lot smaller 
0,i bought one for my grandson and he seemed to like it for gaming we had to return the first one for the same reason so that was two his second one is still working so we decided it must have been an isolated incident wanted the colored backlighting as well and it was still rated higher than most so purchased one for myself bad idea this morning it worked when signed in to my computer and then stopped working in the middle of meeting do not trust this product cannot even return the most recent one and do not understand why out of bucks 
1,the headphones were nice do appreciate the the fact it has mic attached and they are pretty comfy on my head and its fits tightly on my head so don have to worry about it falling off or anything so it good for gaming when you need to focus its one of those headphones that has two cords for phone and pc plugins which is slightly annoying since don have pc but since it does have one its good for those that have and play pc games
1,sound quality is excellent great bass sound too connects instantly to my iphone battery life is amazing use it few hours almost every day and it lasts the whole week 
1,great
1,the sound quality is perfect definitely the defining feature was playing fps where it was raining in game and had to stop to check if it was coming from outside the rest of the headset is easy to use for pc and console gaming would definitely recommend for any gamer
1,purchased as gift for my nephew he really likes it 
0,i used this product once and tried to use it for my work laptop and the usb broke inside the laptop can get it out dont buy this it cheaply made
1,likes no noise click lights look cool chargeabledislikes chargeable battery life is very short had to turn off every time don use it or else battery runs out super fast within days after months the charging outlet is broken there no way to fix it now can use it anymore safer to go back to traditional battery mouse which lasts for long time 
1,keep in mind other players might hear static like noise when the headsets are plugged in otherwise good product for the price 
1,was having pool party and this speraker rolled in the pool and died right away sounds good boy is not watter proof only had it for like to weeks
1,works fine but it feels like toy kid would use super light and made with thin cheap plastic
0,great overall broke too quickly but that just might be cause the kids use the heck out of it 
1,i like the the ease of use don go through batteries because it chargeable the light is not over bearing the lights don disturb sleeping loved ones the ergonomic design is easy on the hands overall it nice and easy product to use 
1,great for the money matches my expectations 
1,amazing customer service had an issue with the st pair of head phones was happy with the sound quality and production value of the headphones however the set received was very tight against my ears causing them to hurt after only an hour our two posted review of my experience and bengoo representative reached out to me they sent brand new pair at no additional expense and am very happy with my new set they fit properly and are very comfortable they have great dynamic sound primarily use these for online gaming and am able to clearly identify if sneaking up behind me the mic is very clear and cancels out background noise very well would highly recommend this product both for the quality and the amazing customer service
1,nice sound love the bass not too loud but loud for its size
0,was great until it fell less than foot onto carpet and broke the day after my return window will not recommend this to anyone due to how apparently fragile it is now left with broken mouse and disappointment 
1,is came with one side of the headset not working then when speaking into the mic the other party couldn hear what was being said recommend maybe different one if this worked for you great but on my end it didn the box came little beat up looking too also very light weight feel like they would have broke easily sent it back for refund 
0,its really good headset think the only flaw is the pressure on the ears but that might just be me thing
1,the only thing is the light won come on endless you have them plugged into the xbox and the cord is so short can use them would love have my lights
1,purchased this for my son he could hear and be heard clearly wish the usb cord was detachable as we will not be using it with computer wished there was way for it to light up while playing video games great value for the money 
0,hello these headphones didn last more than months there is no audio am disappointed in the quality and would have thought these would have lasted longer 
0,i like this mouse but the battery literally died in day charging it now see how long that takes say 
1,great keyboard good value and keys don make much sound lost the receiver for it few weeks ago and thought now had useless paperweight instead of keyboard reached out to klim customer support expecting less than nothing and was surprised that they were going to send me new receiver from their facility in france at no charge it took just over week and had my keyboard back up and running just had to do quick and super easy pairing procedure thanks to klim customer service and one service agent in particular who probably can name here it not often you have hassle free efficient and genuine customer service anymore well done 
0,worked literally for couple of minutes then stopped probably wouldn trust it with your apple products 
1,it came in great shape and sound quality is better than my old set 
0,so loved this and use computer daily so you could say it is only intended for rare usage it broke within the month was sad specifically the scrolling button 
0,fits my needs
0,i like it cause don have to spend money on batteries
0,bought for christmas for video games and already they don work only months later
0,i use this with my macbook pro and its good eye catcher when djing 
0,i bought this for my son and it dies very fast and it does change colors by itself like it shows on here
1,great
0,i like the overall design the slim profile and touch is good and the clicks are responsive where struggling with this mouse is that as trying to work there is lag and the mouse will then jump around on the screen also trying to hold and highlight group of text for some reason it loses connection what ve ended up having to do is clicking on my document and then using my shift arrow keys to highlight the text that need for general web browsing this mouse isn bad for productivity it not really working for me and going to go back to my wired mouse 
0,i wish the charger was longer it so short used it once and the mouse was not calibrated had to bang it couple of times then it worked buying new one do not recommend this product 
0,squeezed tf out of my head sent it back
0,i think it good sound quality isn bad the mic isn bad either 
1,i ve had this for about year or two now and it works amazing have had it fully submerged underwater and just being splashed also take us in the shower or gets little steamy and it works perfectly and all those different conditions like to listen to podcasts or music when go to sleep so usually have this playing when go to bed and it lasts overnight and usually for like whole week but usually have my podcast or music on for only an hour or two but have the speaker on all night if that makes sense the speaker is also really loud and it connects to other jbl speakers really easily which like like to listen to music when ride my bike so bought this strap for the jbl speaker which connects it to my bike and the jbl speaker works really well on it really recommend this product 
0,it works okay but is hard to charge 
1,excellent battery life so far right out of the box with no charge it lasted hours straight sound quality excellent little larger and heavier than thought it would be perfect for working in kitchen but little too big for my disc golf bag 
1,this mouse is great it feels good in your handle glides well easy to use and looks amazing while doing it it makes work little less boring and looks so sleek on my desk 
0,like the rechargeable battery part the most bought this for my gaming grandson and he is happy with it will soon be buying one for me to replace my aging keyboard liked wireless keyboards but hated replacing batteries 
1,everything is great except the enter key 
1,the headset is really comfortable great quality and really really good overall
1,it has good sound and the mic works great usually others can hear every little thing in my house but with this one it really dialed down to just my voice so there is active noise canceling which takes some extra circuitry and passive noise canceling which is just the shape of the thing making it really just noise isolating take your hands and cup them over your ears now your hands are passive noise canceling just like these headphones it world of difference from an active noise canceling still good headset just know what you re getting 
1,enjoying my new keyboard very sturdy and connected well with my devices 
1,i love the sound quality this is great product for the price 
0,keyboard stopped working after month 
0,the seal was brocken already it was supposed to be used it looks really new
1,grandson loved it
1,i thought this mouse was very cute love the led feature and used it to play games with friends val league genshin etc and it is passable for someone who plays casually like me but probably not for someone picky about equipment however today it spent some time in the side pocket of my backpack and no longer seems to work turn it on and the light flashes and goes off again and there is no way to take it apart or try to fix it if you transport your laptop pc lot would hesitate to get this mouse but otherwise was fan 
0,ok
0,the quality is not bad the sound is decent
1,love good sound powerful and stylish do not regret the purchase highly recommend 
1,this mouse is on point literally had never thought of buying one to this slant and size until the color locked me in it an absolute match to my laptop the setup was quick and easy simply turned it on input the usb and was using within seconds it very versatile and works with or without pad lightweight and easy to store with the flat shape 
0,worked fine for what was needed fell off of the table one time and broke in half wouldn purchase again for my disabled mother 
0,usb got stuck and broke inside my computer
1,great speaker use it everyday when working out haven plugged it in to charge for over week great battery life sounds is awesome worth the money
1,love everything about this bluetooth speaker easy to connect any device to it also pairing other jbl speakers is awesome too 
1,my son loves this he had another mouse and he lost the piece and this is good replacement love the slick design
0,this is the worst mouse ever 
0,cord too long
1,this mouse looked promising based on all the positive reviews it is light good to hold and has good battery life it is also quiet with exceptions see below its main problem however is that the middle button the scrollwheel becomes unusable after only short amount of use after which the button needs to be pressed repeatedly in order to register button press also compared to the lmb rmb buttons which are sometimes too light and register button presses accidentally the mmb is extremely rigid in comparison it is also very noisy which is ironic as the other two buttons are completely silent it is much more noisy than other mice have used which is about as someone who relies on this button during daily usage this is very frustrating and frankly serious design flaw like to emphasize that the mouse has been treated well not rough also bought the non led version of this mouse and the exact same problem appeared after the same amount of time another drawback is that the mouse does not indicate when the battery is low leaving one to guess when to recharge it it often becomes erratic mouse pointer moves around and does not register movement well requiring power cycle this is occuring on more than one system all in all decent attempt but quite few issues need to be ironed out doubt the many positive reviews for this product have been based on any more than couple of weeks usage as these issues are consistent and appeared after months frankly expect mouse to last significantly longer and also have useable middle mouse button hope these issues get addressed by the manufacturer 
1,superb sound quality great dynamic range crisp highs and deep deep bass battery lasts for at least hours pairing is quick and stable app is simple and works fine can check charge level and play stereo or party mode with additional speakers seems durable and only hope it lasts buy and get ridiculously great mobile stereo for about 
0,it really is
1,my son loves it
1,love the sound quality use at work 
0,i bought it in september and didn receive it not until september we are at october end it already went out not even month it started at the end of september with not keeping charge so kept cord in and charged during the day while working on it then stopped working turned off and on and just completely stopped 
1,this keyboard works exactly as expected though it says it quite keyboard its fair amount louder than silent keyboard like the logitech one the led are nice and able to adjust the brightness find this helpful because work in dark room at my pc the dongle is able to connect easily and has good reception the keystrokes are reliable and the keyboard well built with not completely smooth keys personally like the small amount of texture on the keys the keyboard also goes to sleep after maybe minute to save battery life charged it when got it and have been using it for days with heavy use of those days all in all solid keyboard for reasonable price 
1,sil loves it so that good 
0,i ve had this device for about months brought for my kids distance learning no issues so far charge the device at least once week
0,i loved this mouse used it for few hours of office work once every week or two so very light use in the scheme of things for computer mouse received it end of june and it is currently middle of december so about months until the roller scroller part of the mouse broke 
1,love these gaming headphones and they seem to be super sturdy 
0,otherwise it seemed to work fine 
1,it lights up very pretty but is very laggy doesn track very good with cursor can deal with that since use mine for work so switched back to the mouse my company sent me

1,i really enjoy the mouse with the different colors that light up when clicking the left or right buttons on the mouse it is very quiet 
1,great mouse love the lights when using it 
1,matte finish is nice keyboard feels of good quality leds are only on when in use goes to sleep after seconds or so very quiet great packaging and it comes with cool stickers 
1,awesome sound excellent battery life 
0,it very cute looks chic now can find my mouse at night with out problem 
1,we have two of these now and we love them 
1,i love this speaker the battery lasts for good while charge it once month and use it for about minutes each day during the week the quality is great ve had absolutely no problems with mine buy another one if something happened to the one have 
1,okay so cannot answer honestly about the gaming capabilities of this mouse my husband is the gamer can however let you know about my general usage opinion first off it pretty love the color and love that it lights up on the sides there is setting on the back that allows you to turn off the lights to save battery drain ve been using it for days pretty consistently and haven needed to charge it there wasn any software or drivers that needed to be installed in order for it to be used just plugged in the small usb and it immediately worked that all can say at this point since haven had it that long will update this review in few months and include any issues may experience and any new opinions develop 
1,nice keyboard overall the tactile feedback is pleasant although don like the placement of the key the colorful backlight is cool but some keyboard shortcuts simply do not work ctrl shift for example doesn work if you use the left ctrl shift keys that pretty outrageous since that is very common shortcut used in many apps on most operating systems it not just my keyboard this is apparently known issue with the keyboard don know how klim can sell keyboard with known defect and without warning about it 
1,works very well on any surface colors flow well well worth the money 
1,i bought this for gift when looked at it decided to buy one for myself love that it is rechargable and usb cable is included great tech style 
1,best little speaker
1,this mouse was back to school gift for my th grade son it charged fine the first time worked ok never charged again and stopped working school has only been in for one week and he already needs new mouse can give it more that one star if it doesn work

1,works really good when you playing call of duty or division to love this item this is the second pair ve bought one for me and one for my friend
0,product didn work straight out of the box unfortunately we didn get to use the product within the return window so out the cost of the product never could get it to connect even though we followed the troubleshooting guide downloaded from the manufacturer light came on when you typed but nothing every showed on the screen not impressed though with the hour charge use stated on the box for that you might as well get wireless unit with batteries 
0,broke so fast made out of plastic if you dropped it on your bed it could ve broke it antique at this point do not buy this please at all costs 
0,doesn work for ps head phones will work not the mic

1,its worth the price really good quality easy to install very smooth and works perfect highly recommend it 
1,it seemed fine at first but then tried to type the sign eventually figured out it was on another key not great if your only using it for gaming its good keyboard if you using chat it wouldn be great 
0,leave it for few minutes and come back it has to be turned off and back on needs frequent recharging 
1,the mouse is exactly as it appeared love the lightness and design didn feel aggrevating symptoms of my carpel tunnel as quickly after use this enabled me to work longer 
1,i love that do not need batteries it recharges fairly quick slim design fits my had perfectly also love can turn it off 
0,i really like the feel and look of this mouse love the matte feel and the lights its also very quiet and not clicky wasn expecting that for the price the only issue have is that if you use it with laptop and remove the receiver often the receiver will come apart im not techy enough to figure out how to make it stay together with glue idk whenever take it out the usb drive and the black part separate and its hard to take the drive out of my computer when that happens frustrating will say that it lasted couple months before that happened though if you use it with pc and never remove it itll last longer just wish could get replacement receiver don want to throw the mouse away if the receiver is the only issue with it got it in february and noticed that it glitches bit if its not on mouse pad or about to die which can be annoying but manageable the mouse charges very quickly 
0,i bought two of them we didn use them every day but they both broke after months it is waste of money and you should not buy them 
0,if you re looking for wireless mouse keep looking this is not it the first one received didn charge so they sent me another one which started using at the beginning of july and now it doesn work anymore didn even last months with normal usage no gaming or anything such shame because actually liked it

1,stopped working after the second week charged it overnight every night before left the office and it was working fine then it started skipping so tried to put it on the charger for the day and used another mouse thinking maybe it just didn charge the night before then when took it off it wouldn work at all but it does feel great in your hands and the lighting is pretty cool just wish it would have lasted 
1,great product very easy to use and understand sleek design too 
0,colorful
0,it works perfectly fine but it is not what need 
1,i like how slim it is and the colors are nice touch without being distracting clicking is responsive though the movement was little glitchy for me sometimes my biggest complaint is that the usb sticks out super far if you have to use the usb adapter 
1,nice mouse if it worked the first one purchased worked for about month when the scrolling wheel broke the company replaced it free of charge now six months later the second one has quit working won hold charge 
1,the gaming headset is pretty good for such low price 
1,very comfy and sounds amazing wearing the headset it isnt too heavy or bulky and the sound quality is crazy good its like you are actually there it sounds so real its crazy would definitely buy again and recommend to others also really liked how there is headphone jack and usb to use to plug into your electronics

1,super light and cute
1,woke awesome very loud
0,i have smaller jbl speaker and really enjoy it so decided to get the jbl charge as an upgrade this speaker was surprisingly disappointing the bluetooth function was terrible couldn get consistent listening experience it would cut out despite updating firmware switching wi fi networks forgetting and reconnecting the bluetooth ended up returning the product 
1,my son was very happy it bright blue has blue light and looks like it came from outer space 
1,perfect little speaker jam around the house with it or take it with you wherever battery will last me days and this thing even has bass perfect for my fishing trips or camping trips 
1,thin design makes it easy to use and stylish no bother with batteries just plug in and charge
1,i like this mouse because of the leds and the color but the usb converter that it comes with is not reliable had to use different one in order for the mouse to be usable have also noticed sometimes lag in clicks so wouldn suggest this for gaming or something where you need to be super responsive and precise
1,love being able to toss it on the bed when deep into my hobbying and need some space wish the backlight stayed on bit longer but then probably have to charge it more have no problem recommending this keyboard at all 
1,the mouse is sturdy and the rainbow lighting feature is fun it auto shuts off after minutes think which is great for saving the battery thought that having to put it on charger would be major inconvenience it not at all the recharge is quick and only do it once week so far 
0,used these headphones while playing on the ps did stream to test out how sound to other it was basically at whisper even when was raising my voice same problem when tested the mic using my phone the sound output is also low raised my ps headphone volume and it wasn any louder then the headphones was using before at lower volume the wheel didn help in either of these situations 
1,sleek nice and holds charge for long time definitely recommend 
1,great 
1,this thing is durable beast much better bass than the jbl flip but it is also much larger not too large to not bring places but large enough that it isn quite as back pack portable as the flip if you are looking for mildly portable car camping speaker then look no further this charge is the bomb 
1,my son has been using since xmas great sound and comfortable he will be going wireless on the next pair good starter headphones durable and has not broke

0,the muting function doesn work my dnd co players constantly tell me cut out so the mic also doesn work the speakers are okay but the rest is junk would return but the window has closed please don buy these 
1,i love this keyboard love that it wireless it came charged so plugged it into my child computer and they were able to use it right away love that it fairly quiet typing the backlight goes off quickly which think is good because it saves battery the one thing personally don like is the placement of the return key and the backslash key used to the backslash key being above the return and the return key being more horizontal super small detail that is taking time for me to get used to but would still recommend this keyboard because it great overall 
1,just literally snap in usb and go easy to hold light weight lights up perfect all around design quality is excellent just what needed in mouse 
1,just got the headset so far it sounds great 
1,so far great sounding speaker very well balanced sound most of the middle that comes out of it is crisp and clear good punchy bass clear treble well defined mix for most music styles 
0,the speaker sounds amazing but battery life is horrible will only last three hours on medium volume before dying out 
0,the mouse cursor jumps around and doesn stay where it supposed to 
0,nice product
1,granddaughter loves it
0,when seller states in the first bullet that the headset is compatible with laptops and it is not that really bothers me my son is happy because he has new headset to use with his gaming console however am out of pocket and have to spend more money to look for something that is compatible with laptop it is disappointing do not buy for use with laptop because it does not work like they claim even with the adapter that is included in the packaging 
0,the metal casing for the usb remote came off and is now stuck in the usb port of my computer
1,had an issue with this after couple months contacted the klim support and they were great to work with and replaced the product promptly 
1,battery life was great worked great for while but it will not charge first time went to charge it plug it into my laptop and power brick it lights up for seconds then shuts off now it won turn on at all sadly would love to give this product more stars but now this is useless and can even use it while it plugged in 
1,i bought this speaker days ago from this comment date used it with its initial charge worked well then tried to charge it it never charged saw many similar problems about this speaker on reviews some faced this issue after month and they can return it happy that it happened within days won trust this brand anymore 
0,when bought this mouse loved it it took me few tries to get it paired right but it is game changer for my laptop the rechargeable battery life on it is great found that if the mouse stopped responding quickly that it was time to charge it purchased it late september and at the end of april my roller has stopped working randomly it worked and then went to use it an hour later and it no longer does the scrolling wheel is an essential feature for me with my laptop disappointed 
0,not what expected hate the sleep feature only stays lit for few seconds and there no way to by pass it wanted lit keyboard so can find the key need in the dark also would not recommend for gaming as the key strokes don always register
0,my sons headset has suddenly stopped working he cant hear anything and just got the headset about weeks ago anyone else experience this 
1,i love this mouse and the color mold is nice works well as wifi mouse 
0,i don really like leaving bad reviews but these headphones were not what was hoping for got these for my boyfriend and now feel like crap cuz feel like got him cheap headphones for christmas they look cool and the sound quality is fine not the greatest but it does the job for the most part the microphone is not the greatest and all his friends say they can barely hear him on the other end no matter what he does and we have messed with this since december and it not gotten better the mic picks up lot of background staticky sounds and if you want the lights to be on they have to either be plugged into portable battery or plugged in plugged in or plugged into your gaming conceal or computer just little disappointed because the reviews seemed great on this but oh well they are cool but not the best for gaming
0,i used the mouse after got it for hours and within the first minutes the light srop changing colors it is now only red 
1,sleep mode turns on too fast for me however really enjoy the mouse overall just use for work travel not gaming 
0,felt awful on my head and just cheap plastic
0,sound is little low but still serviceable 
0,i like the idea of the rechargeable battery however the charge of the battery does not last very long will continue to use the mouse but intend to buy another for use when this one is being charged which is very often 
1,strong connection all month without recharge 
1,nice size fits the palm very nicely led lightshow superfluous but can live with it my old mouse went to mouseville you know the one down in tallahassee fl lol nice mouse for the buck could do worse 
1,great purchase as gift my brother love it for gaming great sound

1,sooooooo good noise canceling is perfect 
0,i like it takes lot of abuse but its not worth it it doesn last hrs slow charging sometimes and didn come with case
1,i just love this wireless mouse it not big and bulky the clicking is quite and it really cute looking 
1,work very well and easy to set up you can charge it with your computer the best thing is no need for batteries
1,sound quality and battery life are amazing love connecting with other jbl products for better surround sound quality
1,got these today and not sure if should even use them specially after learning most it reviews are fake bought new console along side these and not going to risk losing new controller if the adapter decides to break off inside it like some reviewers say the first red flag for me was definitely the packaging it was packed in large box with bubble wrap and just felt unofficial there was also wear on the ear pieces indicating prior use and the worst part is you don even have to use them in game to tell the mic is defective as it won even reach the front of you re face the cord as well as volume slider are bit obnoxious in size and the product overall feels like fragile plastic off brand did test them on my switch and the sound was surprisingly good noticed background static at first which lot of people mentioned but it wasn terrible or even noticeable at times ll probably stash these away for backup pair and just buy name brand pair for the same or even better price and if you are also looking for solid gaming headset then please help yourself and look away from these 
1,comfortable and easy to use the sleep feature is convenient because you do not need to charge as often 
1,i haven had any issues at all using this mouse it feels great the silent clicks and led lights add really cool touch to it as well 
0,after one month and days it stopped turning on work fine until it just stop left it charging for hours still no luck 
0,i followed the instructions to the letter and it was slow and laggy 
0,not for touch typing keyboarding backstory bought two of these one use in my classroom so when in the front of my room can type urls or hit the escape button love that it is back lit as often have lights off in my room during presentations or videos however bought second one for home and cannot type on it am old school and learned touch typing and do so at very fast pace but this keyboard has an extra key between the letter and the enter key therefore hit that key instead of the enter key every time very frustrating quickly returned it as it is useless to me 
1,ordered shortly after christmas and once arrived had issues connecting after realizing my only route to get it to work was to constantly turn the mouse on and off after less than week and one charge it will no longer do anything no lights no power no connection and won charge with the included cord or any other spend the money on different brand this was like ordering from wish 
1,works well and looks great
0,feels very cheap wouldn charge on my laptop had to plug it in on my desktop to charge it finally got it charged just for it to die after hours of non continuous use it getting returned 
0,at home for personal use
0,the on off switch often feels like there is sand in the mouse when moving it it not smooth move like would have expected like the mouse but that roughness is annoying at times 
1,personally would prefer if light stay up longer or can extend that some how know it will drain battery but would just charge more often but besides of that love it 
0,i bought this mouse back in july to use with my laptop when was in class this would equate to few hours each week the mouse stopped working after about month and charged it overnight the blue light never turned off and now the mouse will not turn on or work at all such bummer because really liked everything about it

1,so far so good my son is super excited to have an official gaming headset 
1,love it teacher and the kids love to watch the color change it has soft click so is perfect for progress monitoring so students don hear the click no more messing with batteries stays charged for long time buy another one in heartbeat 
0,my husband bought of these in different colors for our children for school last month yesterday was the first day for our youngest the mouse did great no problem the second was dead since our daughter likes colors so we placed it on the charger last night and it still charging unplugged the mouse to see if it had any any charge no charge at all so now have to explain to my yr old that the company gave her broken mouse and try to find way to to get it work with her device while always charging should of just went to target

1,best inexpensive headset ever got it for my son and he loves it great sound quality and good noise cancellation the ears even light up best money spent for headset so he can game in peace 
1,i like the adjustable backlighting the way the keys feel and how quiet they are most of all like the klim technical support had trouble coordinating the chroma keyboard with the blaze mouse because of interference klim responded very quickly and their very first suggestion worked appreciate quality products and just as importantly prompt friendly and effective technical support

0,i have been using this mouse for days and the scroll wheel broke completely when pressed it it was alright in its short days comfortable but the scroll wheel clicked very loudly which didn like don waste your money 
0,the overall audio is really good but you can only hear from one side of the headphone and every often you can hear static noise that is coming from the headset and the only way you can fix it is by unplugging and plugging back in and know that not exactly you know annoying or an inconvenience but it is kind of annoying to you know having to unplug and plug back in

1,i love the way this mouse performs 
1,so got it for my boyfriend who wanted gaming keyboard but no wire it was on time in the mail looked like it was returned item with all the tape trying to keep the box together but as it came in the original packaging it makes sense while it was plugged in we turned it on to see the lights it was very low with other lights interfering but visible at night or in darkness we left it to charge as instructed and it never charged when it was it lasted minutes at most the keyboard connected to the laptop as we saw it under the devices but it wouldn type or send any sort of input in overall wasn good buy on my part but for gift for gamer boyfriend who hage wires he liked it while it lasted

1,greatest sound and durable
1,my husband absolutely fell in love with them they are so comfortable for him and work perfect 
0,i love the way the mouse looks and feels but oh the mistakes make this mouse has mind of it own and jumps all over the place have accidentally closed files programs while working on them move public folder and having to contact it to move back and many more random errors as result of this erratic mouse sometimes while not even using the mouse can see the curser go on walkabout all over my screen perhaps there is ghost in the machine but if so they are hostile will be replacing it asap 
0,not worth it if you re looking for something to work longer than couple of months my son was able to get couple of months use out of it before the mic stopped working then he would have to hold the cord certain way for him to hear out of one side it wasn worth doing all that so we tossed it since was passed the return deadline would be very weary of those so called stars reviews 
1,i needed wireless keyboard for reasonable price and fast shipping plus this one brightens my home office buy it again and again happy with my purchase 
0,i loved the design and cool light features but true to the old saying you get what you pay for this mouse was pretty bad it jumps and skips all over the page and you have to click the left mouse button or times before it responds to your request very frustrating to say the least not good buy 
1,edit customer service was very responsive they walked me through resetting it they said if it didn work that would covered under warranty luckily it was quick and easy fix the keyboard worked great for month then it stopped working it won work and it won charge 
0,it does not work and have tried to reach the seller instructions in chinese and simply poor poor service purchase at own peril great disappointment for my kid

1,best bluetooth speaker on the market 
0,only owned it for weeks and all want to di is throw it in the trash it freezes all the time and it goes dead every hours
0,i initially really enjoyed this mouse it is good size the battery life is reasonable and sucker for anything that lights up rainbow do wish that you could turn on just the mouse and not the lights without there being constant red light however after using the mouse for less than months the scroll wheel stopped working and can figure out why ve tried cleaning it out recharging the battery and adjusting my driver settings with no luck definitely frustrated and because my return window has past not sure how to reach out to customer service 
1,i love the color as it my favorite color and love how pure my voice sounds and that have no background feedback
0,it may be pretty to look at but it requires constant charging no warning when low on charge so if you are in the middle of using your usb port to hear music or watch dvd you have to stop unplug it just to charge the mouse very frustrating going back to batteries

1,great sound and long battery life waterproof too love this speaker just can seem to get it to link with my other jbl charge 
0,i was really interested in this because it markets itself as quiet and let me tell you if never needed to use the space bar it would be very very quiet however as most modern languages call for spaces between words this keyboard is incredibly loud if you so much as look at the space bar it clacks it probably the only thing you can hear from my desk as every other key is so silent the space bar ruins the rest of the key board no connectivity issues the time out is fine battery is fine keys work great but gosh darn is it loud don know if it going to stop bothering me at some point trying to give it time but may have to just scrap this keyboard and try different brand say spend your money elsewhere as this is beyond annoying

1,i bought this because hate using the mouse pad on my laptop and it great to throw in my laptop bag and pull out when need it it charges by plugging it into the laptop but haven had to do that yet besides giving it full charge when opened it up the first time it does go into sleep mode to save the battery which took minute to figure out but once you realize that it not broken just asleep it all good overall it just basic wireless mouse that works well and is sleek and portable

0,the scroller broke after weeks of intermittent use approximately hours per day days per week 
1,i was looking for mouse to replace my old wireless one with which the scroll wheel wasnt working anymore and found this one am pleasantly surprised by this mouse the click is very quiet yet there is satisfying tactile feel to it though the right click can be bit sensitive but nothing too major think the best feature of this mouse is that it is rechargeable very convenient the mouse can be used while charging and only took about hours to fully charge there is led indicator that turns off to show when the mouse is done charging the mouse will also go into sleep mode after minutes of inactivity to save power overall great mouse

0,superd 
1,purchased for daughter and she didn like the ergonomics of it threw it in my work travel bag and have ended up using it works well and battery lasts while it also nice conversation piece in meetings

0,it sounds good
1,i bought this for my year old for gaming he says it is comfortable and has good sound quality no complaints serves its purpose good purchase for the price 
0,it is headset for small kids if it breaks it headset for kids 
1,my younger don first bought this mouse for his mac mini since then we fell in love with it and my wife bought this for her work laptopit nice to get the customization of color and also very ergonomic in use and effective in performancewe use this mouse in all kinds of setting desk lap bed and even in cars never had issuesawesome and looking forward to rd one to buy 
1,i really like the design and feel of this mouse bought in week the lights are cool and like the sleep feature if it not used for minutes great price 
1,i love this keyboard work in large office from typing all day so needed something comfortable and quiet this has been working perfect for me and would defiantly recommend 
1,love this little guy the colors are fun they change everytime the mouse moves helps you to remember to turn it off easy to charge with usb glides smooth totally love it 
1,works great can use to talk on iphone with adaptor 
1, don use the color changing feature so with that the battery life lasts really long time say that because purchased this may and my battery just now needs charged december and use this days week for work hours day love this product no noise sleek comfortable just love it worth it hands down 
1,i like that you change button on the back so it stays red and that the blue light stops showing once its done charging the only thing is wish it would show you how much battery it has left 
1,amazing product loved the sound and flexibility soft pads does not hurt your years very comfy and very satisfied 
0,okay understood that having mouse with cool shifting lights was probably going to result in somewhat reduced battery life just didn expect this the mouse seems to have no sleep mode the lights stay on unless it completely switched off and the battery lasts less than two days brand new thought to myself that could make that work by just remembering to plug it in at night because do like how the mouse feels and works except last night plugged it in and this morning hours later it wasn done charging have resorted to just keeping it plugged in all day while using it which kind of defeats the purpose of having wireless mouse in the first place and ties up two usb ports instead of just one shame back to the drawing board on my mouse search 
1,great item kids love it
0,i was searching for bluetooth mouse found one but didn like the color when changed to the silver one some how it switched off of bluetooth it is wireless and did work with the usb dongle the buttons are quiet and the movement was smooth unfortunately have mac and the usb ports are only usb the mouse does come with an adapter but this makes it stick out far and will get damaged had to return it 
1,great product
1,just like described very pleased we also had an issue with not getting our first speaker reached out to the company and they were so willing to work with us to get replacement sent out asap would highly recommend this company and product without hesitation 
0,rechargeable comfortable haven killed it yet use it at work haven killed the battery but charge it overnight lasts the day for me
1,great product purchased for my child to use for gaming
0,it worked fine until it quit one day can really complain because of the price but going to to try something else to replace it 
1,use for casual gaming sound is good and microphone works well have only just started using headsets for gaming with recent events driving me to spend more time on the ps this is the second pair ve had and am pleased with the purchase 
0,would buy again for if really needed mouse it is not that nice however it does function so cannot really complain wouldn try gaming with it 
0,feels durable and not fragile like the others worth the couple extra bucks over victsing 
0,i like the raised keys not using for gaming but for work what dislike is that it doesn have setting for backlight to stay on which is what wanted 
1,works great just feels little flimsy so not sure how it will hold up suppose it good value for the price the slowly changing colored led lights are pretty cool like that unlike the apple magic mouse you can use this mouse while it is charging the seller extended the warranty another months after registered it so that gives me little more confidence in the quality or at least the customer service was compensated by the seller for this review with refund of the purchase price of the mouse 
1,awesome sound quality for the price was not expecting it to be this good 
0,item didn come with dongle then when the dongle was sent still didn work in any computer highly advise on not buying
0,i liked this mouse when it worked but the scroll real broke within couple weeks 
1,works very well and makes my gaming more enjoyable my kids said about this headset 
0,i loved this mouse for the literal two weeks days that had it and it was working for no apparent reason the scroll wheel just suddenly stopped working approximately five seconds after had last used it had not subjected it to any pressure or abuse of any sort was looking at document scrolled down continued reading tried to scroll down and nope in the lower ratings this seems to be common problem bummed really did love the mouse 
1,this keyboard looked great in the amazon pix and had great reviews unfortunately never got around to actually trying it out until days after the return window closed hate this thing and will never use it for several reasons the actual keys don light up just the areas underneath them and it very dim it not bright at all and can distinguish any changes when use the brightness keys the static breathing doesn change at all when press the keys 
0,turns itself off and battery doesn last whole work day 
1,i play games like world of tank blitz and fs that uses wasd to control lot the keyboard really helps me to reduce the load of the original laptop keyboard however this keyboard battery life is not so long that you need to charge probably every days if you play about hours averagely plus it is not so friendly in helping you talking through typing since the arrangement always makes me type out lots of typos 
0,my first concern is that it does not give you warning when it needs recharging it just dies out if you are using your usb for something else you have to stop what you are doing to plug in the mouse second the charge does not last long very frustrating and now the most important it died just stopped working oh well so much for fancy going back to battery operated mouse 
1,if you are buying this most probably you have done your research and for me it lives up to its expectation the speaker delivers deep bass for something of its size and is loud enough to fill large room if you want to use it outdoors it will definitely get the neighbors wondering if you re having party it gets pretty loud without getting distorted and at around is when there is sound distortion great for movie night in bed and for listening to music having owned the flip twice this is definitely an upgrade especially with its charging but wish it had strap or handle like the bigger and smaller versions of this speaker and wish it had microphone sometimes but also understand why they didn include it on here 
1,it great headset great noise canceling
1,i like that it easily paired up with my phone liked the bass it had and loud it could go
1,is amazing keyboard for the game is little slower 
0,we liked the first one so much that we bought nd one for my husband to use for traveling 
1,great all around speaker was impressed with the volume on this great bass and highs 
0,only used it few times and like it 
0,the little wheel broke within the nd day
1,i use this in class and at home and there is not any noise when you are clicking the buttons which is nice when we are quietly working on things would highly recommend the color changing is also great 
1,great headset if you are starting out as streamer or trying to save on some money it cancels out lot of noise it comfortable to wear and easy to adjust would recommend this it has nice bass and super loud you can adjust the volume 
1,super cute but it is really slow 
1,great sound not completely sound canceling but not bad thing as my partner is always trying to get my attention and now if he close enough can still hear him over the game the mic works great and sounds clear the cable is long and slightly cumbersome as the mute volume panel is huge but overall it great headset would purchase again 
0,scroller is squeaky and makes noise seems loose
1,this mouse is very quiet just as advertised was shocked at the lack of clicking when you push the right or left side that was my main push to purchase besides the cool colors and led lights must say those are just an aestetic bonus but it kind of makes working fun this mouse is plastic so the gold tone you see is gold plastic and the underbelly is white plastic it charges fast and it responds just as quickly as my older battery powered wireless mouse overall this mouse is really great am glad bought it and if you are sitting on the fence just go ahead and get it 
1,i recently purchased this and am amazed at the high quality of it the sound is great the cable is long and the lights on it are amazing showed it to couple of my friends and now they are making purchasing one highly recommend it 
0,the mic had very low input signal when it worked but mostly it would cut out and not work at all 
1,xmas gift great so far
1,finally decided to buy portable speaker and not disappointed with my decision first time playing impressed me update after using the speaker for some time it not the best would recommend depends on the purpose the bt range is pretty incredible it gets the job done for being portable like others stated it mono with the two woofers battery seems to drain on me little quicker so make sure keep it charged after or during use 
1,at first bought these wired headphones so could use them for my nintendo switch but use them now for anything that isn my phone they are very comfortable and give high quality sound that makes games feel that bit more immersive it is also very convenient to switch them between devices unlike bluetooth earpieces there also isn audio latency with compared to bluetooth either definitely recommend these headphones 
1,great sound and work well in the party mode with or more speakers battery life is good but if you like your music loud don expect more than hours of play time 
1,beautiful 
0,i liked the design of this product but after two weeks it stopped working kept having to turn it on and off to get it to track at all disappointed 
1,it quiet and cute love all the colors and the battery last long time
0,i bought this as wireless mouse have used it for less than month and it doesn hold charge unless it plugged in will be returning it and do not recommend this product 
1,this mouse is very quiet just as advertised was shocked at the lack of clicking when you push the right or left side that was my main push to purchase besides the cool colors and led lights must say those are just an aestetic bonus but it kind of makes working fun this mouse is plastic so the gold tone you see is gold plastic and the underbelly is white plastic it charges fast and it responds just as quickly as my older battery powered wireless mouse overall this mouse is really great am glad bought it and if you are sitting on the fence just go ahead and get it 
1,these are heaven sent
1,works perfectly and the bass it has is great 
1,it won charge have to send it back
1,this is great keyboard for wireless quiet typing really like the use of the colors 
1,i use this exclusively for my raspberry pis and it works great love that the dongle sits under the mouse itself makes it easy to bring with me everywhere 
1,headphones clear sound working as intended microphone microphone performance is abysmal my friends could not understand me switched back to my last microphone to solve this issue verdict this headset if it did not have terrible microphone or did not have mic at all would be solid piece of equipment if you can find headset with better microphone quality grab that instead 
1, let me start off this review by saying was very excited to get this mouse because it matched my desk my bedroom and my laptop perfectly absolutely loved the mouse right up until two weeks of having it and it completely stopped working don waste your money not worth it 
1,clicking the right and left stick and it is slow to catch click cheap yes but as they say you get what you pay for cute yes but not worth the frustration 
0,sleek and reliable
0,works as expected 
0,the battery made it two years but now it no longer holds charge and the charge has to be plugged in at all times to work battery can no be changed out only one year warranty and that doesn include battery issues previously had bose and they stand by their products including dead batteries 
1,already had one and loved it and got another for second home 
1,i can power keyboard off when not using it so that plus ve not had to charge it yet but that due to barely using it so definitely worth the money
1,i loved this mouse it is super lightweight and the color is lovely sometimes would forget to charge it after week week and half so that was on me to try to remember but just yesterday it stopped charging usually the light turns blue when it charging which is great indicator so left it overnight to charge while plugged into my laptop this morning when tried to use the mouse it didn work thought maybe hadn plugged it in properly but just now when plugged it in tested out several different usb ports on my laptop the blue charging indicator light flickered for second and then went out it seems that this mouse is not charging anymore making it basically useless 
0,i originally had rated these lower because they did not work with our xbox one controllers after days of using however after even more fiddling around we found out we needed to update the controller firmware once we did that the headset worked again 
0,the battery lasted about hours not the as advertised the sound is fine guess it really treble and there isn way to adjust it overall disappointed in this speaker 
1,doesn work and won charge cheap 
1,love everything about it so far just hope it works longer than some of the other ones ve purchased 
0,these worked great for month we received them on june nd and they stopped working by august th was attempting to contact the seller and can not for any reason get in touch with them do not buy 
1,i got the vifa reykjavik and although would say at the mid level the sound quality is identical clear bold and good bass this jbl blows the competition out of the park at the higher volume settings no distortion or loss in quality the speaker is built well and looks great too worth the money think 
0,i bought pairs one broke within one day microphone broke off and the other set just sucks
0,it is really quiet and colorful 
1,big sounds for neat unitlove the designbattery seems to last forevernowi listen to my bible studies and southern gospel music while work and really can hear everything and enjoy the crisp clear words and soundsmy wife enjoys using it also 
1,works grate love the base
0,ordered set for christmas everyone got them plugged them up and nobody mic worked tried them in pc switch and xbox 
1,this is good product especially for the reasonable price it is just as described so am very happy with it 
0,the usb dongle broke for the mouse and is now completely useless wish the seller sold replacements so can use my mouse again 
1,i like the feel and look of this mouse bought it as deal of the day really like how it changes colors and how smooth it feels also love that you can recharge it only dislike is that review and edit important documents for work and sometimes the cursor would move unexpectedly and will cause me to type something wasn trying to type ll have to undo whatever did other than that good price and quality 
1,my son uses these for playing games and they work perfectly the noise canceling might be too good as find myself repeating my words haha 
0,almost every time type the keyboard always misses key press for some reason and have to do it again don know if it the key sensitivity or something else but it irritating 
0,very ergonomic soft click like that it recharges and doesn need batteries can plug it in overnight if need to but the charge lasts long time it is comfy
0,is exactly what was looking for now can lean back and push to talk as comfortably as want
0,where the 
1,i love it overall no dislikes perfect
1,at first it felt cheap but pretty much like all other perfect for what needed 
1,i am not very hard on this mouse use it to work from home but this morning after only using for months the wheel of the mouse broke not sure what happened as am very gentle on the mouse it nice design and love the lights and the fact that it rechargeable but it is pretty cheap and can break easily so keep that in mind when purchasing 
1,this thing last forever and the sound is fabulous for music or movie 
0,pros matte feel slim profile quiet clickcons instructions were in another language so there wasn any information on how to set up guessed came with scratch on it track wheel does not work 
0,i needed wireless mouse for my new macbook pro that only has usb connections this mouse included an adapter that allowed the standard usb bluetooth receiver to be used in the usb port have only had an opportunity to use it in limited situations thus far but it seems very responsive and performed well the led lights are kinda cool but not really needed trying to see if there is way to use the mouse without the led lights on so can conserve the charge on the battery the only concern issue ve had thus far is that the charging cable connection to the mouse and the adapter don seem to be the most secure and couple times it seemed like the connection came loose and the mouse was no longer charging was still using my laptop while the mouse was charging via the usb port as recommended in the user manual the user manual specifically recommends not using plug in charging adapter like for most cell phones because it might overcharge the mouse and damage it it is recommended that you only use the provided cable and charge it via your laptop to avoid overcharging and damaging the mouse not certain how great an option this is since it seems to come loose and stop charging occasionally if continue to use my laptop while trying to charge the mouse we ll see how it goes in the future if it turns out that it was operator error may update my rating overall though the mouse feels good in my hand and it seems to work well doing everything necessary when need it 
0,this is my second jbl charge use mine at the pool it completely waterproof it been thrown in the pool and never stops playing works about hours between charges and now that have connect them together for surround sound 
1,really great product it came on time and it was of great quality thanks so much
0,very cute but the cursor for the mouse didn work all other buttons worked thou
1,from the day received all my touchpad headaches are gone wonderful product that keeps me enjoying the clicks without any noise no headache of battery life recharge and go mouse that signals more than meters distance the color attracts and keeps me cool during operation 
0,i just got this mouse and doesnt even turn on after charging the usb plug does not work as well this just isnt good buy if was you would go for different one cause its waste of money so just save it and look for different one
1,i like that this cute mouse holds charge for days and is rechargeable no more batteries dying on me 
0,purchase this for my grandson he takes excellent care of all of his gaming equipment unfortunately these only lasted couple weeks and stopped working very disappointed because cannot get refund or an exchange

0,this is the second one of these we purchased lasted years of daily use the cord is wearing out effecting the sound where it plugs in 
0,was little disappointed that there was no way to keep the lights on longer seconds just isn long enough for me give us the option to be able to keep the lights on all the time it just looks better also the lights aren very bright other than that its nice keyboard but not sure if ill be keeping it 
0,straight out of the box the left click button doesn work completely useless sending back don waste your time like have 
0,people are right this is rip off waste of money it only worked for week wow
1,great product 
0,you can barely hear your game gave up and just used my speakers on the computer monitor so could hear enemies and what not all these do is block noise like pair of lighted ear muffs they do not enhance game play in the least 
1, the mouse is very bright in the dark love the aesthetic of it it very sleek and looks nice with my laptop the battery lasts pretty long it stays on red when you need to charge it love that it is rechargeable so no need for batteries 
0,i really liked using this mouse it died hair quicker than like but would just use it wired while it charged up however month after using it the middle scroll circle clicked down and wouldn come back up making it impossible for me to use as use that often in playing sims didn expect much as didn pay much but was slightly disappointed 
1,looks pretty but not very responsive use it at work and have to back up and re read everything type as it misses letters adds extras if you even brush them with your finger which is the only time it works really well and spend way more time than should proof reading to make sure the keyboard isn making look like can type 
1,this mouse is absolutely done and performed as stated by the seller smooth movement and quiet clicks virtually no sound and love the light show it emits around the mouse if you are looking for great quality and functionality look no further because here it is 
1,never got to actually use this for real my computer wasn built when initially bought it but it was functional at least with my laptop but soon as was ready to use it on my desktop it won work for anything the only reason am giving this more than star is the seller at least tried and replaced this receiver when thought that was the problem but unfortunately this is cheaply made keyboard and basically you get what you pay for don expect robust quality with this thing
0,i use this for my laptop needed silent wireless mouse it wireless and silent the roll ball button is loud like regular mouse but left and right are quiet charged it used it once the next day tried to charge it and cut it on it wouldn come on or the red light flashed and immediately went off wouldn buy this

1,great price great product
0,i use an alexa and love the sound but needed something portable and this just did it without compromising sound quality 
1,my son is and he has no complaints about this headphone he said his friends also said they could hear him well and clear 
0,quiet typing no latency only issue is that it doesn stay charged for long stays charged for about days and light doesn show when it needs to be charged other than that it is pretty good keyboard 
1,had high hope for this cute product was very disappointed for starters the charging light did not work so couldn tell if it was charging at all when tried it the next day after charging it did work only directly plugged into my mac wouldn work in my adaptor which is another issue and it worked that day the next day it would not work already annoyed as wasn looking to charge this all day to work for only work hours did turn it off after each use as well the next day it worked for even less time maybe only couple of hours this mouse is cheap junk and don recommend it to anyone 
0,so far am very statisfied with it
1,i been cheap with my headsets but been looking for one to replace one that broke and paid lot of money for this one is really good if you play cod loek me its important to hear where the footsteps and coming from well here you go this is the best headset you will get for the reasonable price
0,light weight
1,it is awesome my son loves the lights and likes how it feels and sounds 
0,we bought one of these for our week at the beach and man what sound connecting it to my phone was breeze and the controls were simple to use battery life is insane too definitely recommend 
0,it was nice until it stopped working the return window literally closed yesterday
1,my husband had the prior version and we loved it so much so that purchased this with the case to link to his we use them everywhere and lot charge life is excellent even better than my husband individual and linked stereo sound fantastic portability at the beach by the pool and around the property when we re doing projects and chores great and convenient ease of use for technical illiterate such as myself ranks so after an entire summer of almost daily use giving this solid 
0,such huge size of speaker and sub for it to perform badly next to competitive speaker that half the size and cost and produces more noise and superior bass compared to this distorted speaker with no bass wouldn recommend 
0,i purchased this for my office work and it broke down after weeks the scroll wheel stopped functioning be aware of this and look for something else with better quality thanks
1,the item shipped quickly and arrived as described sound quality is great and sound can fill up room not very bass heavy but good balance also like the ability to charge other devices 
1,it was perfect my girl uses it everyday
1,great sound quality at great cost bang for your buck type of purchase 
0,very nice product 
0,pure junk
0,didnt last long
1, this being my first rgb product like it it surely not high end top of the line keyboard but it enjoyable for what it costs my only issue it fingerprint magnet and with it being black it too easy to see you can clean it well with non alcoholic solution though be sure to use gentle cloth to avoid smudging 
1,the smaller flip is not only louder but sounds better due to speakers instead of the mono speaker in the charge 
0,idk about sound cancelling but my son hasn complained about it he into gaming and animations kingfuture is his name 
1,got this speaker as replacement for my original refurbished ue mega boom played that thing full volume on many occasions and after years although still sounding great feel the speaker might have ruptured bit decided to try jbl and didn want to get the charge because of the price and tacky huge jbl in the front think old speaker models offer great value as they sound great and are cheaper so far so good with this jbl plenty loud of course haven been doing full volume yet because cautious due to my previous ue experience love that it sits on its side and love the color we will see how it will hold up but so far great just as expected from jbl 
1,it great but being smaller makes it easy for larger fingers to hit the wrong key works great and looks great and the extra features are cool 
0,this is total waste of money as it stopped working after two weeks so dissappointed with this product 
0,it last long time charge it maybe every days maybe once week go to school times week and in nursing school so lot of homework just purchased but it already making noise when scroll up or down 
0,i can trust this keyboard to type read every key type it constantly misses letters and entering hidden passwords are pain because you don know if the keyboard even registered the key you hit 
1,only thing don like is how short the usb cord is to make the headset light up everything else is good 
1,works fantastic
0,good product
0,i had one of the first jbl can like speakers it lasted about years then it died found this one as replacement it louder than the first one love it get 
0,works great for casual gaming comfortable for long periods of time run into issues sometimes where if lot of effects go on in game headset has hard time following but that rarely happens best headset for the price tbh
1,excellent mouse it really handy and helped me lot in my academic work am already big fan of it 
0,good product but the recharging part is inconvenient
0,i dislike the way too big enter key 
1,i enjoyed the look and watching this mouse light up but that is essentially it the battery storage on the mouse is super low so you ll have to plug it in any way after about half hour of use maybe an hour if you turn off the rainbow led light feature the mouse scroll wheel broke on me in middle of game not any aggressive game mind you just house decorating sim and ve hardly used it for the six or so months ve had it to sum up for quick cheap purchase it looks great but isn worth it in the long run and regret not buying different mouse 
0,i ve bought of these mouses when the first one broke thought it might just have been dud really liked the mouse up until that point so decided to get another one it been weeks and the same issues with both mouses the scroll button broke while the mouse does still technically work it super inconvenient and annoying 
1,good buy it lisent very good and good quality
0,i don use this everyday maybe twice week love how quiet it is but the scroll button stopped working it now just continually spins 
1,my brother loved this headphone
1,i love this speaker it really awesome it loud it cute the only thing don like is the fact that haven had it for very long and the fabric is dingey keep it in my case when not in use and it barely gets touched just moved from one spot to another if anything ve tried wet cloths and all that but it just weird uncleanable material 
1,i so happy that purchased this mouse it sleek and it easy to use enjoy the light component it adds uniqueness the mouse is light weight the usb chip is easy to keep up with because it fits in small space underneath the mouse that way the chip never gets lost also like the idea that can charge the mouse and never have to worry about an internal battery malfunctioning highly recommend this mouse for purchase 
0,i just got in today happy to start gaming with it the mic you can talk it static not is worth getting it just better off get dollars mic regret getting it but sound it good but everything else is bad
1,we love the ease of use and sound quality of this speaker 
0,i only bought this for the silent keys have newborn baby and needed silent clicks but this keyboard was more loud than my current gaming keyboard if you need reviews on anything else please read elsewhere didn even connect it simply started typing and was disappointed stars being generousmaybe the company is comparing their keys to mechanical stroke keyboard if that were the case then every keyboard would be silent compared to those 
1,love this mouse it has sleek design and works wonderful love the quietness and the perfect fit for my small hands 
0,it last long time charge it maybe every days maybe once week go to school times week and in nursing school so lot of homework just purchased but it already making noise when scroll up or down 
1,i bought jbl charge recently it is excellently crafter extremely durable produces well rounded sounds for enhanced music experience for normal people frankly of population with budget of would recommend charge series speakers recently compared it with the shrill voiced marshall emberton that wanted to buy as had heard so much about it and charge is clear winner for normal ears durability water performance base power battery life looks color options and most of all the music that jbl charge produces is way more superior that emberton similar to our routine lives only ears and good judgement were used for comparison no technical sensors were used for testing am not associated in any way with jbl or hk or marshall or any other music speaker brand 
0,good if you want wireless mouse that works for months otherwise buy something else 
1,spend more dollars for better more solid keyboard
1,i like that this mouse is rechargeable feels weird in my hand and doesn move as fast as expect
0,gaming pc
1,i use it for every day work it great
1,sensor doesn always pick up movements to clarify am not using this gaming but as wireless mouse for work and coaching speech and debate sometimes when sit for too long the sensor takes time to come back online andreas movements this can be super frustrating when you are working and you need to move with alacrity but such is the life that one would expect from mouse overall you are doing menial office tasks this is probably an okay mouse the rechargeable batter is cool and am happy to not have to replace batteries but would probably go with wired mouse in the future 
1,from the day received all my touchpad headaches are gone wonderful product that keeps me enjoying the clicks without any noise no headache of battery life recharge and go mouse that signals more than meters distance the color attracts and keeps me cool during operation 
0,have not even had the item for three weeks and it has stopped connecting it was going strong for about week and then all of sudden it began to have problems do believe that the mouse is very cheaply made spend few extra dollars and get quality product 
1, aesthetically this is very enjoyable to use because of the changing colors of the rainbow like how it wireless and it can even work from small distance away on another table from separate from my computer it works very well it has an on and off button for storage 
0,i bought this in june it is october now the left side of my keyboard keys work intermittently which is annoying when typing paragraph or more and it is filled with mistakes think the rest is going to fail soon complete waste of you can find something better

1,i bought this for my laptop for school work and it exceeded my expectations the colors are amazing and not too distracting so easy to connect and use it also silent love it 
1,looks great feels comfortable however when lifting the mouse it would shoot the cursor all over the screen which can be frustrating when playing games or working on detailed spreadsheets

0,the mouse functions well however after few days noticed that the multicolor lights no longer changes hope to find some way to fix it 
0,i like this mouse however after one week of use the scroll wheel broke 
0,i bought five of them this year and three already broke after few months of light use two had the plastic wheel axle broken the another one just stopped charging and not recognized by windows anymore in addition the usb dongle cover separated and got stuck in the laptop usb port this mouse is flimsy and does not last not very ergonomical as well cool lights is the only positive thing to say about this mouse but it eats battery avoid

1, absolutely love it and it is rechargeable changes colors the battery lasts forever stars
1,i ve had this headset for couple weeks so far say it is working very well sound quality is good there is no active noise cancellation but don feel that it would be necessary can hear everything clearly without turning the volume up too high the higher you go the more distortion you will hear as expected at first wasn getting the microphone to work unplugged the splitter from the single mm aux plug and re connected it after plugging both audio cables from the splitter in again everything worked as intended for those who aren familiar make sure the pink connector goes into the microphone port and green goes into the headset port this review is based on using the headset on pc have not tried using it with anything else at this time also there is toggle switch next to the volume dial on the headset make sure it is switched on microphone symbol without line through it if you plan to use the microphone overall would recommend this headset it is priced very reasonably and it meets my needs

0,the mouse was stunning when first got it it was very fluent but the one problem and very major problem for me was the fact that the mouse kept left clicking every time right clicked and my chromebook didn have setting to fix it overall it was just an annoying issue 
1,i purchased this mouse as the wheel on my old one quit working loved the design and wanted another so ordered it and received it aug it is oct and the wheel just quick working again would recommend looking at different mouse if you prefer your scrolling feature

0,since live in the remote rainforest always keep backups of necessary items like keyboards bought this keyboard several months ago and stored it in it original packaging until needed it two days ago my current keyboard malfunctioned so got this one out of the box to use and the key mostly doesn work at all or it puts double or triple letters am now stuck for about month until can get new one very disappointed

0,the style was perfect however the mouse stopped working within the first week tried to charge it but it simply stopped working it was waste of money 
1,it comes already big doesn really fit well the cables are to short for spreading requires you to plug into the console to use the led lights wasn pleased but the sound quality and noise cancellation works great 
1,i love this mouse love the led colored lights the most another one of my favorite is that it is magnetic and sticks to my laptop when in the car or at the local coffee shop 
1,as with several other reviews here the one purchased lasted several months until it just stopped tracking mid swipe thought maybe it just needed recharge as that what it has done in the past when forgot to charge it overnight but no it more like it just shorted out works for swipe and click and then stops again kinda sucks because it really cool and fun mouse with the led lights and the charging vs batteries guess ll look now to see if the warranty will help girl out

0,dropped this mouse once from desk to carpet and the scroll button broke guess you get what you pay for 
0,i enjoy the snarkiness of the ppwk in the package minus the space bar all of the keys are very quiet gave it full charge before use it worked immediately backlighting turns off after its idle for bit simple tap of any key wakes it up dig that the backlighting is multi colored just plain white being that not planning to use it for gaming going to need to get used to the shape of the enter key there is an additional key on the middle row where would naturally hit enter no biggie minus star because the space bar is quite loud 
0,i bought these for my classroom have sixteen total they are constantly connecting to each others receivers and some just losing connection and not reconnecting after sleep mode think it good office mouse for anyone who isn using it in setting where lot of them are being used do not buy if you need more than one 
0,the and keys sometimes the key and the enter key just stopped working two months after bought this thing never leave reviews but this is truly unacceptable do not buy period 
0,i ve gone through or of these in less than year they are not durable in my teenagers hands sure they are not the most gentle with them either buy them because they are cheap and we just need to get through the school year have switched brands recently to see if it them or this brand that just breaks it always the scrollers that break

1,great mouse nothing super fancy comfortable to use the lights are pretty cool but there is an option to not have them on which is great to extend battery life holds charge really well and will still work with the usb charger plugged in if necessary plugged in to different computers and worked immediately on both seems quite reaponsive but only use it for general computer work so dont know how it would work for gaming all in all great mouse for decent price will update if anything changes

1,very nice keyboard for the price like the angle it not to steep so you it comfortable on your wrist for extended typing the keys have nice feel to them as you type the backlights help while typing in the evening it pretty nice keyboard for maybe someone starting to build gaming pc setup at the current price think you get good value the charging cable could be bit longer but the battery has lasted good amount of time so haven had the need to charge it too often yet 
1,silent clicks works great takes getting used to lower profile not having to worry about battery is golden 
1,great product recommended 
0,if you want an led mouse for aesthetics dont buy this brand this has flashing red led that is seperate from the rgb leds it stays on even when the led switch is not on 
1,this is great mouse especially for the price it quickly responsive even after sleep mode like the look of it too 
1,it does everything ordered it to do for good price rechargeability is huge plus to me for wireless mouse the clicks are satisfying and it feels nice to hold my only gripe is that the lights on it are bit weak but honestly don care about that in the slightest and that not why bought it so it not big deal

0,the mouse had come in greasy package and had already been opened before opened it myself it had brown and black stains all over the top of the mouse and was of horrible quality would not recommend it to anyone looking for mouse 
1, sooo this thing is so cute for starters it light weight and without my mouse pad it smooths across surfaces easily the buttons aren hard and actually it easier to click on different things only negatives have when it goes into sleep mode have to turn it on and off and the second thing is pro and con for me the usb chip to make the mouse work wireless is stored under the mouse love it because it makes traveling with this mouse for work super easy just wish it had latch release had to use card to pop it out other than those things it great didn even have to charge it when took it out the box 
1,sound is just as good as the smaller charge not good if there is background noise like in factory perfect for in house or backyard 
1,i like the mouse it is cheaper quality though the mouse didnt really look exactly like the picture but overall its not bad

1,its very light and fast comfortable and changes different colors great buy 
0,product is extremly cheap looks like something from five below or wish you can see right through it and it dies really fast im sad missed the return window but will be buying new product
1,great for gaming bought they are pretty loud too
0,while it nice mouse fits well it junk it died in less than month purchased two so called upgraded updated don waste the money it junk 
0,none of the buttons worked once connected and got help from tech at jbl website who said to return it as defective
1,this headset is purely amazing there is really no more to it it has noise cancellation and overall amazing quality
1,this keyboard lives up to everything that is promised in its description would recommend 
0,i haven had it long and it just stop working it not in sleep mode it also says that the port has used all it space for the usb 
1,sound is good but could be much better cord is too long and gets tangled easily
0,the cord tangles around itself in several locations the internal wiring is damaged and the product has failed in two months 
1,i ll first mention that if you are buying this you probably don want to spend an arm and leg for gaming keyboard however you definitely get the most for what you pay for ve been using this keyboard for months now and though it isn as comfortable or bright as others it gets the job done don really care too much about the light features fading mode breathing mode but my biggest problem is the brightness of the light if the room is well lit you can definitely tell rgb is lit but its bit dimmer than expected at night was hoping to clearly see the major change in color between the keys on the keyboard but the keys do not allow lot of light through the transparent plastic on each key you can see the color very clearly between the keys but not so much for through each key the only improvement suggest would be to make the keyboard slightly less harsh on the hands after hours of typing and increasing the maximum brightness of the keyboard besides that the battery is fine for the price and you can still use the keyboard if the battery dies by plugging it in which is pretty convenient like said you get what you pay for and this is more than fine klim did pretty well and this keyboard has lasted me several months without any major issues 
1,first of all the keyboard is far from silent every time hit the space bar there is loud and very audible clack secondly just know that you can change the color scheme it just rainbow colored the whole time you can change the brightness and the speed it breathes but that it on the plus side it was ergonomic and comfortable for the minutes used it before unplugging it and preparing it for return so there that guess all in all like said returning it this is not what wanted or expected 
1,i very happy with this bluetooth speaker it sounds terrific and is pretty powerful in an open room 
1,if were younger person or one with perfect eye sight this keyboard could have been perfect additionto my computer equipment but as an older guy with glaucoma in my vision find that this keyboardis not very comfortable for me to use the most disheartening problem is that the keyboard illuminationgets turned off after seconds even though it is always plugged in into usb power source mostlywork in completely darkened bedroom so as not to disturb my sleeping partner and it is annoyingtrying to locate turned off keyboard in the dark also find that the lights do not clearly illuminate the keys also am not touch typist shame on me and so seeing the keys quite clearly is important to me it is also hard for me to make out the inscriptions on doubly labeled keys because the inscriptions aretiny to my liking am really very sorry for such negative review of your product like said in thebeginning had been young or had perfect vision this review could have been different please forgive me 
1,i purchased this for my year old grandson and he loves it he takes it everywhere with him great buy 
1,the bass is super cool like playing it in close room 
1,it could me louder but it works and sounds great volume is not that big of deal
1,i love this mouse it is sleek and fits perfectly in the palm of my hand love that it lights up beautiful colors it is rechargeable so you don have to worry about finding batteries best purchase made highly recommend this mouse 
1,its been less than months but the mouse has already popped open and doesn work just wish it would last longer 
1,honestly feels bit on the cheap side and compared to other similar makes the main difference being led lighting so it adds wow factor to it clicking is also smooth and feels nice and the top down view is pleasing the lighting itself is mostly smooth but blotchy at some points where the color is abrupt rather than seamless transition performance wise it does the job but ergonomically doesn feel as form fitting as gaming mouse really use this as backup work mouse or home mouse where its just to surf the web also the cursor sometimes randomly jumps first time this has happened on mouse so it seems like they really cut costs and marked up the price if were to guess the price if seen the product without price tag probably say its about bucks 
1,love the headset great sound great bass noise cancellation all around good
0,i ve had this speaker for less than year and have for the most part absolutely loved it use it in my car for long road trips and when the speakers in my laptop blew out started using it every day for podcasts etc from my laptop unfortunately the battery is just not holding charge it flashes red indicating low battery and then reads fully charged when plug it in after less than minute totally inaccurate as it reverts to flashing red again in about minutes very frustrating and ridiculously hard to change the battery myself don own the right tools so now in the market for new speaker 
1,this keyboard looks great and works well great customer service got this keyboard when the pandemic first hit it worked great for few months and then one of the keys started to misbehave not having time to deal with it put it to the side and forgot about it after picking it back up and trying again more of the keys had stopped working about years later reached out to customer service siting the year warranty and they were absolutely wonderful both helpful and very nice and replaced the product now have the new keyboard and have been using it and have not had any troubles 
1,i love this mouse it so silent and smooth to the touch 
0,mouse takes long time to connect and spend way to long to try to make it work it got here fast though
1,i like the keyboard it works great the battery life is pretty decent has low button noise soft button presses just wish it would take longer for it to go into sleep mode and if there were different light up options to choose from but all in all pretty good product 
0,works good for laptop
0,i was super exited about this product for my laptop sadly it didn even work after week tried everything to get this mouse to work charging for two days try it on different computer nothing helped the mouse didn even use the cursor refuses to respond to the mouse movements 
1,the mouse won charge anymore put it on charger for hours and when my daughter trys to use it all it does is flash red and doesn work so much for her christmas present
1,excellent quality great sound and lightweight
0,decent while it worked though waking from sleep required switching it off back on underneath the laser stopped working fully charged up only color lights work making it useless 
1,great
0,the mouse works fine but was disappointed that the color did not match my macbook as it shows 
0,worked great for few days but then it quit working it wouldn charge and if got the light to actually come on the cursor wouldn move 
1, just needed simple mouse for desktop only use for watching videos in my living room its super quiet and lightweight no lag also using it for cricut designspace with no issues 
0,as described
1,when bought this mouse really liked it it felt nice worked well on consistent basis and the colors give my desk pretty touch it was cheap so guess you can expect it to last but was hoping to get at least year after months of light daily use it doesn want to charge even if leave it plugged in all night in the morning it barely has any charge this is decent mouse if you don mind having to buy new one couple of times year but going to just spend little more and get one that is hopefully better quality 
0,my grandson likes this headset 
0,the price is right and it has rechargeable battery if you want that wireless vibe or you can keep it connected 
1,the cord has already broken but before that they were great gave them to my preteen son for christmas and he seemed to love them 
0,soft light smooth 
1,i opened it it connected to my phone it loud and wonderful love it
0,okay
0,very good
1,one of the best gaming headsets ve come across so far ve already tested other models from this brand 
1,it is just ok product for me it could be more finished product but its not sometime it seems like its not clicking at all lights are good but for performance give it three stars 
0,durable battery life took it to my camp trip and literally played music all day with out having to charge it
1,it is nice mouse and liked that it came with an adapter for the macbook however the adapter did not work which made the mouse unusable the adapter seems flimsy and cheap luckily had an adapter and the mouse now works fine if you are buying this for mac would recommend investing in good adapter 
1,it came in good condition and it has good sound
0,i like that is quiet mouse however one side of the mouse stopped working was going to see if can get an exchange and missed it by days broken in less than month 
0,did not function even after charging and plugging it in returned 
1,these headsets have great sound which was surprised the transmit volume is little low but you can still be heard and for me it doesn fit well but my daughter said they do her after hearing the sound from these am probably going to order me new pair cause mine apparently are horrible but won these cause they just don fit me well for kid would recommend them in heartbeat 
1,this is the easiest we have ever had anything connect via bluetooth sound is great and so far we have not had to recharge it will try to follow up in about year highly recommend 
1,i love this mouse if you have smaller hands or like mouse that doesn feel to big in your hands then this is for you the color and lights are cool touch as well 
1,works great with blue tooth
0,good
0,cheaply made mine broke already barely used and it came apart and can snap it back together short charge life though it is convenient to have charge vs battery 
1,i bought like new speaker but before made my purchase contacted the seller and basically asked why the product was classified as like new their response item is inspected and functional there day return period took chance the only reason didn give star rating is because my speaker arrived very poorly packed consider myself lucky the speaker is of such superior quality durability because delivery people don make habit of handling packages carefully and the protection provided amounted to some shredded foam from an original box thrown in regular shipping box with the packing bubble wrap everything had shifted in shipping there was no effort to secure the bits of packing material to protect the unit and it arrived with no user manual or operating instructions of any kind had to go on youtube for tutorial and to jbl site for manual download so stars for the product itself actually give the shipper stars but don want the overall rating to reflect poorly on the product itself jbl is the truth 
0,within week of my son using it the scroll button broke somehow it outside the return window so now we are stuck with it 
0,the usb broke off in my computer and had trouble removing it finally got it out with finger nail clippers was happy with it until this happened

0,very good
1,the enter button is huge issue love the keyboard except for the place and shape of the enter key my finger hits that button and the enter button all the time the keyboard is perfect in everything else just can get passed that part returned the keyboard and ordered klim light rechargeable wireless keyboard us layout for that one has fix the enter button issue 
1,this mouse works perfectly for what bought it for it ergonomic chic colorful and works long time before needing to be charged it came quickly and was packaged nicely buy with confidence 
1,sounds ok but was expecting better in sound
1, super cute for the office love the one lights 
1,the box was torn and there is scratch smudge on it hope it works well the colors are beautiful though love how the white mouse looks it very clean stars because of the smudge can get off and packaging it obvious not the first one to own it 
1,this speaker sounds clean and has good base
0,i was using these headphones for my laptop and sound only comes from one ear and no matter what do it does not work and the audio plays out of the headphones when plugged in
1,for the price it has excellent noise cancellation the audio quality is good and the overall comfort of the headset is appreciated it adjusts and doesn bother me or my glasses 
0,if your looking for loud speaker don buy this buy the wonderboom it cheaper in price and better sound quality 
0,i have yet to be disappointed by bengoo products and this follow suit the sound is absolutelyphenomenal and these are comfortable the moment felt the head cushion when removing it from the packaging was shocked at how soft it was for very affordable gaming needs with high end quality you have to use bengoo 
0,the microphone doesn work with my ps controller defective out of the box 
0,i have been using this mouse for weeks now and have no complaints it goes to sleep on its own and comes back on easily with click no delays or problems connecting to bluetooth do wish had way to know what the battery life was but just hook it up every days and it hasn died on me yet 
0,awful product you have to turn it on and off all throughout the day to get it to work horrible 
0,stopped working after couple of weeks 
0,works so good 
1,i grabbed this because was having difficulty with my mouse pad on my laptop but it great love how compact it is and it hasn had any issues since bought it like years ago 
0,i drop it once and it just completely breaks
0,one thing to know is that you can have lights on if you are using this for ps
1,now that an old man and don need anything super fancy for my desktop replaced deathadder from with it only been using it for about hours but no major complaints so far takes little bit of getting use to because it sits so low but the clicks feel nice and seems fairly responsive 
0,scroll wheel failed on both purchases seller would not respond to complaint
0,great gaming keyboard not as bright as thought it would be 
1,almost perfect sounds 
1,my son loves it great product 
1,my niece loves it 
0,not sure why but it kept dying real quick 
0,mouse works lgb died almost immediately the only color actively working on this mouse is the red led and the blue when charging when the mouse is left idle for minute or two it seems to desync and takes minute to wake up it gets in the way more often than not otherwise okay product 
1,super easy to use just plug in to do the initial charge and then recharge via the usb cord as needed kinda fun to have the light display change colors throughout the day soft touch when you right or left click and barely makes any clicking noise 
1,they are comfortable but in the picture it show that they light up they do not son was upset
1, works great really light great looking
1,the mouse itself is great works well however the roller ball on the top of the mouse broke and no longer works it has only been weeks since purchase do like that the lights have an on off function so you don need to have it lit all the time which makes it more appropriate when in work environment 
1,its amazing love it
1,prior to this had jbl flip for few years before it finally died decided to go for this charge rather than another flip since wanted little more volume out in the garage this charge has surpassed my expectations it significantly louder than the flip but never loses clarity even at high volumes the audio is clean and bass is very good as well the biggest surprise has been the battery life feel like the speaker gets used constantly but it only needs to be recharged once week or so it also waterproof which makes it super easy to clean all in all couldn be happier 
0,some standard hotkeys don work with the left shift button disappointed but want to like this keyboard the company refunded me then ordered another one cause it neat keyboard and hoped the problem was fluke nope same problem on the second one specifically ctrl left shift any of the following u m do not work on this keyboard if you normally use ctrl right shift any key suppose you won notice problem but for me first noticed it trying to select inverse in photoshop ctrl shift and found the other problems using keyboard ghosting tool aside from that problem like this keyboard but it really touts anti ghosting stuff so did not expect this kind of problem it might not seem like big deal but it easier for me to just use different keyboard than re learn decades old muscle memory and who knows what other key combinations are faulty 
1,very good sound and very well made
1,this is our second charge so we can have stereo awesome sound for the size and great battery life 
0,my son loves his headset but don keep throwing them and being rough will break
0,no sound canceling these are just regular headphones the audio jack is weirdly thicker than it should be so hard to plug into things and very snug when you do they re very light and cheap but you get what you pay for if you want gaming headphones look elsewhere if you just need headphones with mic these are technically fine 
0,doesn hold charge very long hard to click use stopped working all together have gone back to wired mouse much easier to use 
1,it sounds great good quality loooove it
1, love that the colors change it perfect haven even had to charge it since got it 
1,love it been use it at the pool riding my motorcycle for bbq connected for mo it outdoor of my patio love it the only cons is the jbl app no equalizer option to add play list the app is useless but the espeaker it amazing waterproof love it love it 
0,i have had many headsets and the sound from this headset is terrible nothing like what they have posted or advertised highly do not recommend these for gaming
1,comfortable and sleek great for traveling love the colors running around it 
1,this is the th jbl that we ve purchased for ourselves and as gifts great unit 
0,sounds quality is trash you can barely hear the game the mic is also terrible everyone is saying sound muffled will never buy from this company again 
0,when opened the box for my head set and pulled my headset out noticed that the wire was cut so couldn hear anything 
1,i bought this for my son and the microphone didn work what disappointment update the headset works good initially gave it star thinking it didn work we just found out it was my sons controller with the problem luckily we kept the headset and tried it on new controller and it works great 
1,great so far use it for my macbook pro and really enjoying it great touch and super lightweight 
0,my son loves them but unfortunately they stopped working after months
1,i always wanted wireless mouse but did not buy one because though about the amount of batteries would go through decided to give this one try and just have to say wow charged it for the first time on for two hour like the instructions indicated and as of today it is still going strong mind you work from home and use this mouse hour day monday through saturday have not had to recharge it at all it works so smoothly and it automatically goes to sleep when not in use am super happy with it 
0,if could put zero stars would my order came with the correct packaging but as soon as opened it it was not the speaker that is advertised someone replaced the speaker with used black speaker that isn even the same brand completely ridiculous 
0,so disappointed this promised to be cute and functional mouse but it never worked not even for day charged it followed all directions am tech proficient and it wouldn even turn on feels cheap too so not surprised so disappointing to purchase things that don work all too common anymore 
0,after months of use keys p n have died did not spill any water onto it and was used somewhat frequently for programming guess that is expected due to the cheap price point but was hoping it lasted at least bit longer 
0,the mouse is not effective charged for hours still no life or function do not buy when noticed that the mouse was not working charged it for hours tried the mouse again and it still did not work but showed red as one of the colors which may be warning the seller did not respond or reply to assist me with any troubleshooting unsatisfied customer 
1,love this headset bright color when glows up and sound quality is amazing would highly recommend
1,i love this mouse it fit feels great in my hand on the computer lot so that is important to me love the colors as you can tell by my mouse pad love colors it easy and fast to wake it great don have negative thing to say 
1,works great my year old enjoys playing with this using his xbox 
0,update after working with the company they refunded my faulty headphones they told me that they have new manufacturer use that information to decide if you are willing to risk it at the price offered thankful they at least tried to rectify the issue hope they don keep selling the faulty product 
1,weight just over two pounds it not small enough that you can easilly put it in backpack buttons on device are easily accessible sitting along the top of the devicethe jbl charge offers slightly better power output than previous incarnations of the jbl charge with rated power of watts rms additionally the device uses usb type for charging can achieve full charge in hours and offer hours of playtime on full charge the jbl charge does feature jbl connect plus so it can be wireless connected to more than other jbl speakers that also have jbl connect plus it is worth noting that you can connect jbl bluetooth speaker with jbl connect to jbl speaker with jbl connect plus 
0,how do return it for repair stopped working after only several hours of use see it has year parts and labor but how can get in contact with someone to return it 
1,i absolutely love this speaker for work would like more if it gave notice to charge before it just shuts off
0,the mouse works well asked is comfortable to use but the changing lights drain the battery very quickly 
0,i had the mouse working for one day then could not use it any further the mouse pointer had mind of it own and would take over it own movement what disappointment was hoping not to go back to battery operated mouse say do not buy this product 
0,good product for the money
1,i really enjoy the multiple option you have to use this headset for different types of gaming 
1,i honestly can say absolutely love this headset the microphone is clean clear and crisp my friends can hear me and can hear them clearly the ear paddings are comfortable and nice even the length of the headphones stretching to fit my head shape are great love these headphones 
0,terrible product battery would never last more than hours and after little over month it stopped working altogether would not recommend this product 
1,just great item
1,roller will not work the mouse won scroll seems to be very common it never worked 
1,excellent keyboard
0,don buy it it can hold charge it moves on it own and was way too expensive for how crappy it was 
0,loved this cute little mouse but it broke after months the wheel broke off from the gear 
0,horrible quality the wheel stopped working only after few hours it is very light and feels very cheap 
0,got my computer hooked up to the tv so its nice to have this on the nightstand and it light up at night 
1,stays on battery dies in less than days unlike advertised so have to keep it plugged in don know what these guys are doing but this isnt it hate this thing sorry to say had high hopes for it
0,very bad quality sound and microphone is very bad quality
1,im totally impressed with the sound of this jbl speaker its perfect for my shop and by the pool setting it up was simple definitely recommend 
1,i love the colors that it shuffles through also like that it is virtually sound proof no more hearing click from across the room only thing wish could pick stationary color instead of that feature always being red 
1,okay here we go was really excited to get this and try it out want to note that wasn expecting much since it is pretty inexpensive however my excitement didn last long the dpi will not change on the one got so changed my mouse settings on my pc this very very minimally helped couldn help but laugh while doing this because that curser is sliiiiiiiic ccccck for some this may fit comfortably in their hand but not mine also it goes to sleep quickly as in seconds quick yes timed it unfortunately ll have to try to return this since won use it ever by try to return it mean try to actually remember to take it to the post office or wherever need to take it because that never actually happens in closing if you have small hands you re looking for super slick meaning super fast mouse that you may or may not be able to change the dpi you ll only use it once maybe twice year and you re good at taking your returns where they need to go to get returned then go for it otherwise maybe look into different one also gave stars since is was inexpensive 
1,i like that this mouse has sleek look to it slim ergonomic good quality not cheap looking like the color options available very easy set up ve been using it for couple of weeks now and it works great have not used it for gaming great price and will likely buy my next mouse for different computer have from the same place 
1,these headphones are amazing for their price have been using them for fortnite and roblox the mic works great and the sound quality is overall good would highly reccomend for any gamer 
1,wow this mouse is pretty choose the gold colored one and like it connecting to my laptop was simple just plug and play plus the slim design fits great in my laptop bag 
0,mic didnt last months 
1,this is great for beginner gamers the headset is comfy which is important because we use it for hours and hate when headsets gives headaches from the pressure it does cancel outside noise pretty well but you can still hear bit which prefer since would like to know if being spoken to when playing but you have to take headsets off to actually hear other people in the room like that you can use in the pc and ps because the headset jack works with the ps remotes like others mentioned the usb has to be connected to light up for us we don mind the light not being lit up so it not big issue after all when you are the user you really don look at yourself unless you are streaming live with face view and you want that extra flare only issue had which isn big issue is the mute for the mic isn easily accessible and the switch is sometimes hard to quickly use when gaming for those times when you want to be muted so others don hear every background noise or family talking so find myself trying to switch between mute while playing which is hard when you are playing fps games and in an intense section but that might be me not able to multitask that quickly lol just wished the mute button was button possibly or the slide switch it does has was higher up the flush so you aren stumbling trying to slide plus it doesn really feel like it slides all the way so you are double checking know went into depth of the issue but it isn huge issue just my input maybe when they decide to make another model they can put that into consideration overall love it going to buy couple more for our gaming family 
1,nice bass but not in stereo looks like it had two speakers but no cost too high maybe for this trade off to be worthwhile sorry 
0,this mouse feels very sleek to the hand however the battery only lasts about hours and takes about an hour to charge fully the led lights are not very bright even when turn the feature off the mouse still dies in about three hours 
1,i like the product but why did get another charge of dollars and one cent the next day please explain
0,so all in all for this thing is fine the rgb is not actually rgb instead featuring the average rgb rainbow cannot customize the coloration just the brightness and the pattern pulse breathing something along those lines all that said this is fine budget option clicky bois beware this is not very tactile prefer it that way but know many dont
1,great looking speaker and the mono sound is clear and loud if you re looking for stereo don bother with the charge unable to get my two speakers to play in stereo mono party mode only contacted jbl support who said sorry but the charge is unable to play in stereo at this time our engineers are working on it and yet they are still advertising as the ability to pair two speakers to stereo with no timeline from the engineering department as to when looking for stereo speakers don buy these 
0,it has too much lag it slow that why hate it
0,bring to the beach
0,it turns off when using it sometimes
0,these just died no help with replacing them they are only months old do not buy 
0,scroll wheel completely stopped working after two months the power cord also stopped charging the mouse after few weeks of use complete waste of money 
1,i want to start with have owned many many many portable speakers in my life because im pretty rough on them go racing with them and they get kicked around and covered in dirt and mud and get thrown and all kinds of stuff but this speaker is by far the best sounding and best quality bluetooth speaker ive ever had its been run through the mill and used every day for multiple months and its still just as good as day one very nice battery life also if you re in the market buy this one 
1,i bought this at the end of august and it worked great until now now it won hold charge and can return it because it has been over the time very disappointed 
1,i love this speaker took it to california and it is so easy and light to travel with the sound quality is amazing not only that but the battery life is soo good didn charge it the whole trip and used it for few hours each day have never had any problems with it so far but would highly recommend

1,much better in all categories than the bose soundlink had before ve had this for few months now and no complaints this little speaker produces great sound and lot of bass 
0,small but solid 
1,grabbed this for my laptop so don have to mess with the trackpad for work after days of use it no longer holds charge not the fault of the charge port as switched it to different one to be sure the price is too good to be true 
1,very comfortable to wear and it was great deal for starter headset it had everything needed and wanted
1,very easy to use and efficient 
1,great keyboard very responsive keys
1,great
0, not so great with the rendering dragging objects with the mouse is not so great especially acrosss screens work on visio lot and its just very hard to get this to drag stuff around so basically has bad sensor but its smooth and very quiet 
0,i was bit too busy with work and school and missed my window to return this item the quality of the mouse and usb plug is just horrible ordered the mouse with urgency to get power point project done for schooland had to run to local discount store to purchase another mouse because the usb piece fell apart and after careful putting it back together the mouse won connect over got about minutes of use fromthis product

0,this mouse works but has high pitch noise the entire time in use drives me crazy 
1,got these for my year old son who wanted some gaming headphones he gave the reviews said they are great 
0,doesn stay charged
1,i bought these because play games with my husband and other friends and family needed something better than the headset was using this headset is so much better wear glasses and it comfortable so it doesn hurt my ears while wear them the sound is good and can finally hear understand people when they talk lastly people can hear me better also the mic being on the left side is added bonus my husband sits on my left side while we game and doesn always use mic himself and it able to pick up his ramblings so other people can hear him even without him having mic 
1,this mouse has been so much better on my wrists it sleek new design makes it easier to sit all day without the need to move to another position to relieve the strain on my wrist love the rechargeable aspect because no longer need to struggle with the endless supply of battery replacements it is so easy to sync up and was ready to go right away so many colors to choose from too 
0,used for xbox one
1,sound and mic quality are top notch very pleased with the product
0,bought this awhile ago to start setting up my home office didn need it right away so set the box aside pulled it out this weekend to discover that the keys don work correctly multiple keys are stuck together typing or displays tg for example keyboard is essentially useless but because didn examine it right away my return window has expired and stuck with junk that doesn work lesson learned 
0,i bought one and the piece going into my laptop didn work the second broke easily 
0,the mouse worked fine at first then the battery stopped holding charge for long time after month it stopped working completely 
0,nice sleek design however does not hold the charge for long it frustrating when the computer is turned on and it doesn come on after switching it on 
0,i really like how they feel they don compress my head or make my ears sore
0,i bought this month ago was working perfectly fine until last week then for no reason it stop working properly it not responsive the cursor move does not match the movements of my hand and can no longer use it just ordered another mouse from other brands

1,portabledecent weightstrong bassgreat upgrade from flip pairs well with flip to balance strong sound
1,i love theme for everything
0,son is very pleased with these headphones used for schoolwork and gaming
1,great quality very happy
1,feels great nice color looks like it will last very long time charge last along time as well 
1,great
0,mouse works well and holds charge for several hour work days only drawback for me is that the scroll wheel is loud 
0,the overall quality of the sound was really good and can hear all my games properly through it 
1, pros quiet smooth no delays or lagging issues so far pretty colors when not moving the mouse cons seems bit cheap little flatter than like doesn fit naturally to my palm so it makes it uncomfortable the red optical light shines through the other pretty colors when you re moving the mouse want to see the various colors even when moving the mouse not red led light shining through which is overpowering some of the colors shine all throughout and for much longer while others barely show the right side of the mouse right handed doesn emit the colors as vividly as the left side next to my thumb one small section is almost inoperative ll probably be returning it as have bought another mouse that also changes colors and it doesn emit the red led like this one it was super cheap fortunately in case keep it who knows guess you get what you pay for 
0,works well 
1,i love the fit of the headphones and the extra padding the sound controls on the cord are easier to use than other headphones gamers that am playing with said that my sound isn as clear as my previous headphones 
1,quality for gaming and great noise cancellation
1,this mouse is amazing it is ergonomic cheap and functional defenitly great choice for business for games don have an opinion cause don play computer games 
1,love the colors 
1,works great no issues with my unit power button feels bit flimsy saw other reviewers complaining about it breaking and could see that happening am careful with mine and don use it frequently can change the color away from rainbow but you can alter the effect slightly didn get this for robust color features so this doesn bother me the keys are bit less diverted and less resistant then what used to frequently hit multiple keys while attempting to push one might bother another with sloppy hands like mine but look at it like challenge now that all being said this is hands down great option for wireless gaming there are slightly cheaper keyboards that tout these specs but they seem to be either too cheaply made or have to many reported issues for me to expect quality product on this note this keyboard is rechargeable there are other cheaper brands with similar products but they are mostly battery operated other issues in fact bought keyboard here on amazon that was similar no lights and used batteries it didn work upon arrival this was my second purchase got this for gaming wirelessly and use it with additonal ghz receivers no issues haven noticed any input delay but sit pretty close to the receiver so distance isn something have stress tested currently this is the keyboard would recommend for wireless gaming under 
1,great sound
0,bought these for my son to use in his ps they would not work at all no audio out of the headphone and the mic does not work tried them on my pc just to double check and still nothing 
1,great headset
1,looking to buy other products from this seller packaging was great and happy with the keyboard easy to type and fits my style of simplistic yet modern look feel
1,truly amazing product
0,literally only had the mouse for three days and used it on the first day and now it has stopped working it doesn charge plug it up and it may charge for minutes then it just stops charging then when go to turn it on it just turns on and instantly turns off this mouse is literally piece of crap will be getting my money back 
1,i bought this keyboard for work wanted something quiet but also had rgb even tho there is only the basic rainbow and it not very bright for the price this keyboard is well worth it it very light for easy travel and the keys also feel surprisingly nice to type on for long periods 
0,its really bad
1,i was looking forward to not having to use batteries and not have to worry about wires it was great at first and really liked it then after about week the charge did not even last day and then it quit even charging don waste your money the only silver lining is that had used my reward points so there was no out of pocket 
0,this mouse has very poor sensor it will take several seconds to wake up after being inactive for bit and you sometimes have to click the dpi button or mouse buttons several times and shake the mouse for it to wake up the sensor also cannot move fast if try moving the mouse quickly the cursor gets very spastic and starts curving around the screen like deja vu is playing in the background speaking of clicks the left mouse button double clicks quite bit the only thing this mouse has going for it is its design even then the design is uncomfortable since its so flat find better mouse please don torture yourself with this 
0,did the job
1,the mouse arrived today easy to set up so far it is working properly like the fact that it rechargeable no more aa battery to replace ll have to get use to its size lot shorter than my old morosoft mouse hope it lasts as long as the old mouse time will tell 
1,overall really like the product the response time is awesome for typing gaming and more would give this product solid or stars however only got it in late december to replace keyboard had for or years have now had this keyboard for total of months and already the on off switch is starting to fail have to turn it on and off several times before it will turn on sometimes it won come back out of sleep mode causing me to have to turn it off and back on again repeating the process few times until it finally works once it on it works great honestly expected more out of product that cost me dollars have had logitec and other brands of keyboards throughout the years and they generally last me couple of years at least while really enjoy this keyboard overall the short term time it took for it to start degrading is unfortunate am hopeful that mine is just bad one rather than it being the standard because the range response time and lighting on this keyboard is awesome otherwise have had and dollar keyboards that lasted longer the return window ended in january so guess will be looking for new keyboard that serves my needs better 
0,great at first then after month it stopped working it like the battery was weak and it was slow to respond to movement and felt sticky do not recommend 
1,excellent quality product very good sound for the size battery lasts for long time super happy with this product 
0,this is really great mouse it works as designed unfortunately don have the patience for the very slow response time it was aggravating waiting for it to respond to my finger commands needless to say got rid of it and bought something different 
1,we should have saved our money spent on cheaper speakers and just bought this first great sound quality 
1,i was looking forward to not having to use batteries and not have to worry about wires it was great at first and really liked it then after about week the charge did not even last day and then it quit even charging don waste your money the only silver lining is that had used my reward points so there was no out of pocket 
1,the mouse is very pretty and lights up pretty silent when in use its small in size
0,stopped charging and working after month thought it maybe have just been dead charged it lot more and still didn work looked at reviews and saw that many others had this issue as well
1,simple sleek quiet and most of all it has usb adapter for my macbook air the low profile design is ideal to be carry around mouse if need to bring one ve used lot of wireless mouse and this by far is the best 
1,the major flaw with the mouse for me is that the battery life is almost nonexistent it lasts only about hours for me guessing the one got may be defective because need to have this plugged in all the time to make it usable but can work that way not factoring in the battery everything else is great in comparison to other mice in this price range 
1,best mouse ve ever bought so glad got it perfect for my job 
0,our bose died bought this as replacement very nice
1,i ordered one as gift and the first one received did not work however the second one ordered that was then gifted also worked perfect

1,connects easy and the keys type well well made and not heavy if you need to travel with it 
0,good
0,the mouse didn work after the first few hours of use troubleshooting didn work 
0,so my jbl ve owned for about less than month now and now the speaker itself doesn charge at all the cords work with other devices just not the speaker assume jbl uses bad batteries for their devices regardless this is unacceptable for portable speaker at that price tldr just bought the speaker this month battery already having issues charging
1,i ve had this mouse for almost weeks now and and loved it until just yesterday the scroll wheel developed loud grinding popping sound every time you use it will definitely be sending this junk back and get something else 
0,i got this for my laptop and it does not work very well it skips or just does not move at all gave it to my grandson thinking that since it says it for gaming that maybe it would work better for him but he does not like it at all he says the feel of it is off and it does not stay connected 
1,i love this speaker if your looking for good one this is it 
0,is easy to install ergonomic and functional
1,i like the sleep feature for battery preservation as well as the backlight it smart about how it manages all of that the range is great able to use this from about away in my living room for use with the big screen while my laptop was tucked away under in my entertainment center works well while charging if needed also highly responsive while gaming no delays noted 
1,i absolutely love this keyboard it perfect for everyday business use as well as my gaming time 
0,the scroll wheel broke
1,i absolutely love this mouse super handy dandy because not only does it work with my mac it also works with my work laptop which is dell the only thing don like about it is that if you don use it for while it shuts off mean it great because it saves energy so you don have to charge it often but meh ve yet to charge it again used it for days for at least hours each day 
0,wore for like mins and had to take them off because the ear cushion is really small it pressed up against my ears probably fits kids only
1,the sound quality and bass is better than any bluetooth speaker have purchased before have had zero problems long battery life is key for bluetooth speaker it says hours on the box but felt like it went longer before finally had to charge glad spent little more for better quality speaker this was worth it 
0,really good keyboard
1,quality is great
1,good sound easy to use
0,i ordered this on today is and the keyboard is no longer charging when plug the keyboard in it charges for seconds and then stops this is regardless of whether the keyboard is on or off 
0,tracking
1,love this mouse it very smooth and the battery life last pretty long the led lights are bright but not too distracting if like to game in the dark like do ended up losing the small piece that goes plugs into my computer tho wish could just order that piece also if the charger was bit longer that would be better hate trying to use the mouse while plugged in charging it has no range other than that it good buy
0,it is almost perfect escept the assembly gap is big some dust dirt tiny food waste will go in easily
0,as soon as it ran out of charge the mouse died permanently tried charging it for hours in the hopes that full charge would cause it to work again but it didn would not recommend this mouse 
1,my grandson really enjoys it 
1,the charge does not give the same bass and sound quality as the boombox but is really quite awesome in its own respect when you consider it is only the size of small thermos this baby really puts out great for picnics poolside and anywhere you want compact source of music was really impressed with the sound ain your grandpa radio that for sure 
0,worth it 
0,this mouse works well and is small and quiet 
1,best earphones ve purchased so far

1,best portable speaker ve ever purchased this thing booms 
1,very easy to use good quality
0,very good product 
1,this mouse works great with my new laptop for business use very pretty and sleek love the led lights 
1,looking at the amazing price and the sheer number of reviews thought these would be good but was disappointed they look really really cheap and feel that way too mine had some dried glue or subtance from the factory on them they were ok in comfort but had to draw the line with sound quality if you ve ever owned pair of turtle beach headphones these sound so muffled there was no range to the sound at all just mids and lows it made it hard to be competitive in warzone because you couldn really make out some crucial distinct sounds like the direction of footsteps or gunfire probably should have known better given the price according to other reviews this headset is pretty decent but guess they just aren for me 
0,i ordered for work and for home they are great until died after months it indicated that it is charged but it does not function it might be bad switch they second died in less than months of use disposable batteries would be better for the environment than disposing of multiple rechargeable that stop working faster than battery runs out 
1,i was little worried about battery life based on some of the other reviews am not gamer have an office job but on my computer probably hours day and used my mouse extensively single charge lasts me days you can also use the mouse when you are charging have usb port on my keyboard that use per my attached picture as you can see the charging cable is pretty short so some might need to extend the cord but overall am very happy with this mouse 
1,very loud and has fun features 
1,this is so pretty fits my hand perfect the lights are soooo pretty lol it was beyond easy to set up on my laptop it came partially charged even so could use right out the box easy to charge lasts really long time too love it would totally gift 
0,straight out of the package had issues but figured would hold on the mouse does not move smoothly cannot click on things and then the mouse would move only intermittenly then it would stop and would have to jerk it around and now it has just stopped just upgrade spend little more on logi mouse and it is worth it 
0,i ve been using this mouse for couple of months to do online schooling and now in person classes as well haven had any problems lights make it cute works for all need it to 
1,it ergonomic and stylish very cute colors and cool lights comes with all the attachments like cords for charging and it has small indent under the mouse to keep the part that plugs into your laptop forever losing mine so that great feature very quiet as well recommend it for nice cheap little mouse 
1,great all around speaker ve use it for quite some time now and still love it great sound durable and connects easily
1,i didn realize that it was rechargeable vs battery however it gets the job done and it comfortable to use 
1,have had this key board for about month now and only had to charge it one time after the initial charge while having the pulsing effect on although do not type long messages out like this all day long do use the key board pretty frequently switches feel extremely smooth as well will update again for its use in the long term 
0,this mouse works really well the only thing is don feel like the battery lasts very long use it for work and those are hour days of non stop computer work only get about days of use before have to recharge again 
0,the sound quality of this product is very bad
1,i love it the headset is pretty cool and it sounds nice
0,not practical for me fir everyday use
0,it cool 
1,the sound from this is great it been to many parties and outside and the beach would highly recommend it bluetooth works great my older parents can even use it with ease getting them one for their anniversary 
0,just like the description
0,the center scroll wheel lasted less than week the mouse itself still works but it is aggravating that every time you use muscle memory to scroll with wheel that doesn work decent battery life bought new different brand mouse to replace it the mouse also doesn have much of an arch to it so its not very ergonomic its better than laptop track pad though 
1,slim design comfortable for the wrist 
1,i love the look of this and the quality is great 
1,i was super excited for this mouse its so sleek and small it was perfect for me unfortunately it doesn work all that well its super glitchy especially when you turn it on color mode it lags and sometimes it doesn even click on what you re trying to click on its much easier to just use my mouse pad on my computer 
1,battery life and quality is almost ok have sony xb years old and the power and sound quality is better than this one hoped more power in the new cargo jbl but am dissapointed overall it is good speaker for casual days 
1,it was most important to me to have quiet scrolling mouse for my laptop this mouse has quiet silent scrolling and silent clicking very impressed the mouse is more of flat design the lights around it are pretty neat there is an on off switch on the bottom of the mouse that includes an option for the lights as well nice mouse for great price 
1,these speakers have deep base and great sound outside they are wonderful beach pool thy get thee sound out the battery is also great powerhouse for your phone at the beach 
1,we bought our first pair of these and liked them so we decided to buy second pair great quality especially for the price you plug theae right into your controller they re also very comfortable 
1,the headset is pretty good price very easy to start using and has sleek cool design to match it cancels out noise pretty good as well for example it blocks out the noise caused by fan have in my room my only actual complaint is that it is kind of small like it covers my ears completely but only barely does it do that if you are around or younger it should be fine but you may want bigger size otherwise 
1,i love my jbl bluetooth speaker use it daily and really enjoy the music it significant upgrade over my tablet speaker 
1,very nice color best speaker ever owned sounds very nice 
1,good quality we use it for gaming the backlight is awesome as well
1,amazing sound quality
1,i use this mouse for my laptop love that it super smooth and very quick 
1,this mouse works like charm it is beautiful the changing colors are fantastically fun this fits nicely in my backpack for use with my laptop 
0,this mouse is great and if it didn do this one annoying thing would give it stars it emits really high pitched squeal when you don use mousepad it coincides with the led light color change if you pick it up and set it down it makes really high frequency sound that is very irritating if you work in quiet environment which do it similar to smoke alarm if it were far away get one that doesn have the lights that should help 
1,i have played valorant for about year now and couldn hear important stuff like foot steps now can also now have good mic for coms so my teammates can hear me much better 
1,i purchased for my son th birthday he absolutely loves it he says the surround sound is the best it lights up so cool and the price was perfect thank you 
0,for gaming
1,my first one had about weeks and the wheel broke loose and it would not work received replacement in two days and it perfect can blame them for manufacturing issue love my pink mouse highly recommend it use it hours day days week 
1,i love the look the colors and it fits my hand grip perfectly awesome device 
1,just like the title says died out of nowhere days after the return window and warranty were up tired it on two pcs and one laptop it still lights up but won connect junk 
1,the sound quality is battery life is awesome and is easy to connect to bluetooth it also easy to pack up and take trips with got the red one and the color is beautiful the pictures does not do it justice overall great product by great company 
1,i ve had the mouse for about month and it works great use it everyday for work hours and ve only have had to charge it once after the initial charge recommend for sure 
1,this product feels nice and looks nice sound quality isn top top tier but it got lot of bang for its buck it great purchase 
1,works well and the color matches my laptop perfectly 
0,good as expected 
0,i used the mouse after got it for hours and within the first minutes the light srop changing colors it is now only red 
1,that was my first review but the mouse did not work the seller replaced it immediately and that one works fine again be aware that this is rechargeable mouse and you cannot replace the batteriesthe seller should ve been clearer that this is recharging mouse and don know how you replace the rechargeable batteries so that the only complaintotherwise it great mouse
0,sound quality is great and so is the waterproofness but have two jbl xtremes and they cannot connect via jbl connect with the charge apparently the xtreme is connect and the charge is connect 
1,like it size perfect fit for laptop bag
1,the color wasn like the photo it bit darker than what was expecting see photo for reference did love that the mouse came with usb to usb adapter the part that connects to the computer for wireless capabilities was stuck so had to use excessive force to remove it only other thing could change is the led colors it goes through series of colors but it would be fun to be able to choose what color it could be 
1,i bought this headset as the third replacement for my year old who tends to be tough on electronics he loves the fact that it lights up and it drowns out noise he says that it comfortable and sounds great he has only had it short time but it is still holding up pretty well we will see how great the durability is in time 
1,very light weight and comfortable to use for basic computer tasks it was also very easy to set up took less than minutes as it came charged also the vitter life has been great so far only needing to charge time in the weeks of having the item 
0,i like the color and size but it few days out of the return period and it will not hold charge
1,great speaker has good bass and loud sound holds battery for long time 
0,cool
0,this headphones overall are good but when was using the microphone it seemed to glitch out little but everything else else is fine
1,love the sleek design easy set up fast charging and most importantly how quiet the mouse isit not the most ergonomic mouse and it lacks wrist support so have to stretch lot more but as long as you re not gaming this mouse is great 
1,klim customer care replaced keyboard for me that was faulty after months of use the replacement keyboard was at my front door days later outstanding service if you have any issues highly recommend klim

1,the priced paid for this product and what you receive is amazing thanks for the great product

1,it not the best but for its price its excellent
0,got this for my laptop cause it legit says it works for them and didn work at all waste of money 
0,i ve had this wireless mouse less than month and the wheel of the mouse has already broke not to happy with this mouse won buy this again
0,it didn work at all already had mouse but the scroll function doesn work properly so thought get new one wrong it barely turned on and charged it fully 
1,for the price of the keyboard the quality is outstanding great feel built well looks nice overall came in nice sleek package with stickers as do all their products all can say is get yourself one and check it out yourself now for gaming it does great but if your serious tournament status then obviously you ll need wired keyboard other than that any games you enjoy playing will do fine personally play gta rp and ve had no problems works flawlessly all my fps have no issues either can move around and keys work in sync just fine multiple keys at once works all around great have mouse as well and same thing if your hesitant due to to the pricing don be you ll be happy and glad you made the purchase was skeptical myself and wasn expecting the quality to be that great took the chance and am glad did ll be purchasing more of their products moving forward 
0,they have been being used daily since with no issues my son is the main user but ve borrowed them few times and will be ordering my own shortly 
1,amazing can believe didn get it sooner this goes everyyyyywhere with me 
1,this mouse us nit very comfortable keep hitting the button and bringing up pages don want the cursor jumps sound the page without my moving the mouse charge doesn last long it fun to watch all of the flashing colors 
1,great product highly recommend
1,noise cancellation is amazing 
1,great compact speaker not as loud as expected jbl speaker to be does not hold hours of battery life as advertised my particular speaker is holding about hours of charge prior to dying any suggestions from amazon customer service 
1,its been less than months but the mouse has already popped open and doesn work just wish it would last longer 
0,i ve bought jbl charge speakers over the past years and one flip which is sort of still working and the first two after admitted heavy daily use just stopped working as the item is not easily opened by design or repaired don feel there is any option other than buying other one for usd anyone have any luck getting them repaired after they die 
0,pros surprisingly the battery charge lasts me looooong time think it lasted me month on one charge one of the cheapest in the market cons the first one got didn work the replacement one worked but sometimes the scroll is backwards 
0,i love this mouse it very smooth if had one complaint it would be that it will be dead in the morning if you don plug it up before you leave work but sometimes just forget to plug it up when leave so that my fault 
0,works great charge lasts long time no more batteries 
0,came with big scratch 
1,it was great value it arrived quickly it works great the usb doesn fit my port but the mouse only need usb 
0,bought these for my son as birthday gift and was so disappointed when he realized they did not work at all the first bad review left was deleted when the company promised gift card if we would delete it we deleted the review and never received the gift card so here is the second bad review they are terrible they do not work and the quality of material feels very fragile would not recommend 
1,got this mouse for my desktop setup which mainly use for office purposes and it has been working great it replaced cheaper version than this one that got at below of which did not expect much but got me going for years don think would recommend for gaming since is little on the small side and somewhat flat but who knows is it very responsive thought and looks nice with the changing colors 
1,works well and the splitter is very helpful
0,i literally have complaints use this at work at half volume both the kitchen work in and the kitchen connected to mine can hear the music the reason we put it at half volume is because at full volume you can hear it all the way throughout the lobby from the back door of the kitchen even over all the sounds of the ovens timers and customers talking hands down would recommend this to anyone 
1,love the simplicity of the design and overall product definitely would recommend 
1,this mouse is cute and convenient not heavy the shiny black color looks nice against the colors and it is quiet works fine with my macbook air the only thing is that the usb adaptor it comes with is very hard to insert it into the port that it comes but besides that everything works fine 
1,high quality great comfort glows as shown buy it 
1,so far so good this speaker gets loud without distortion love it and the color so much also like that it can charge my phone it convenient because my area is often plagued by wind storms and power outages sure ll be using it for that soon enough it was super easy to connect haven had any issues with the bluetooth connectivity the battery life is very good 
1,very comfortable and very good for noise cancelation
0,very nice sleek design was expecting lot more given the reviews but mouse stopped working after weeks the usb and usb adaptors are very flimsy and prone to bending so as soon as go to plug it into my computer it does not connect definitely would not recommend unless you are looking for product to use for about week or two 
0,not going to lie not particularly impressed with this keyboard the reaction time is not all that great but what is really annoying is that there is no warning when the battery is low so you can be playing game and suddenly it stops working also no way that have found to tell how charged it is
0,i bought this mouse back in july to use with my laptop when was in class this would equate to few hours each week the mouse stopped working after about month and charged it overnight the blue light never turned off and now the mouse will not turn on or work at all such bummer because really liked everything about it 
1,awesome product 
1,the sound was great
0,it light and the texture is nice but there are few flaws the mouse can tilt forward lifting the back off the table since there lot of surface area past where it touches the surface of the table the mouse is small which is nice for portability but for my hand size it gets uncomfortable after while the battery charge is good and the lights aren too harsh but by far the most annoying flaw is that it doesn maintain constant mouse button press so if you have to hold and drag something it will just randomly unclick even though you still have the button pressed tested this lot and it always without fail stops holding down on the computer this is unplayable for some games where you have to hold down one of your mouse buttons perhaps just received faulty mouse but for the price it hard to complain too much 
1,i just started work from home job and this keeps my workspace reliably functional and fun would absolutely recommend 
0,i not too happy with this led mouse when it goes on sleep mode have to literally turn it off and turn it back on to boot up again thinking of returning it and get full refund on this product 
0,i had brought the headphones bcuz one blue is my favorite colors and two they were supposed to light up when you plugged them in also the noise cancellation well plugged them in and could still hear the noise and could not hear the ppl whom was playing with very very disappointed 
0,totally stopped working after months only day refund policy 
1,unfortunately am lucky to get hours out of the speaker was sure wouldn get the full rated hours but really figured would get more than otherwise great speaker 
0,would totally recommend 
0,broke after month couldn hear out of them anymore
0,i have been using this mouse for about month it had been working perfectly only use it occassionally throughout the day after about month it stopped working while it was on the color changing mode it still works while on the regular red light mode but now not the color changing mode 
0,i bought one it didn work out of the box exchanged it for another and it lasted for months before breaking again spend dollar or two more and another brand this one might be the right look but it will only waist your money 
1,i really loved this mouse but months in and it not working it lights up but does not function with my laptop super disappointed 
0,i got this for my school computer it very nice but the leds are brighter on one side then the other and the scrolling wheel stoped working after days and the usbc got stuck in my computer dont buy this product
1,great product great sound not much difference between the new ones and got this for dollars cheaper than the new ones and it was definitely worth it 
1,it pretty good when you are in the game and need to listen to your teammates talking but when it come to really needing good ear its noise cancellation feature comes bit short it does dampen the noises outside fairly well but not enough for certain games that need an attentive ear but otherwise if you were to use this for gaming it pretty darn good for multiplayer and also really good for single player games 
0,great sound have two managed to turn them into stereo pair once but have problems since then they are independently stereo of course 
0,this keyboard is thoroughly average you press keys and the computer reacts there are no glitches the backlight turns on so you can see the keys in the dark as advertised unless it goes to sleep there is nothing to set this keyboard apart in fact it is lacking in some ways for example there is no way to determine how much batter power you have left which is inexcusable for wireless gaming input device there is nothing worse than discovering your keyboard is dead in the middle of gaming session they did not even need to write software to display this information windows can display it if the device simply provides it am also not fan of the key layout they got creative with the placement of the backslash key instead of being in its normal position above the enter key they pushed the quote key to the left and jammed backslash in between that and enter enter has been stretched up to backspace the end result is that if you try to type backslash or pipe characters say when entering paths or escape characters or coding you wind up hitting the enter key instead possibly times since you re typing without looking on instinct don know how many times have tried to type in path an inadvertently submitted the wrong path to the os by pressing enter instead of backslash very frustrating the quote key being shifted to the left is also very annoying but not quite as bad if you are developer this keyboard will slow you down for this reason alone particularly if you then go to work and use keyboards with standard layout maybe others are different but the absolute last thing want in keyboard is less than standard key layout it renders useless years of accumulated intuition and experience 
1,i just love this wireless mouse it not big and bulky the clicking is quite and it really cute looking 
1,it works great like the color 
0,i really like this mouse for work use mine all day charge it on wednesday mid week and leave it charging friday over the weekend works completely fine coming back and buying two more had to come buy more because dropped mine and it cracked open that the only reason why not because it stopped working but because broke mine so this time in also getting backup my work laptop is mac and rather much buy this mouse than the expensive apple one 
0,this does not work with my ps will be returning 
0,goes into sleep mode too quicklyno problem really seems to be good quality product
1,super speaker love it 
0,has weird echo 
0,warning it interferes with other usb devices plugged in to same computer 
1,i really liked them they have very good sound quality

1,have not had this too long and ve charged it and it won turn on anymore made sure switch is off even changed chargers it stopped working 
1,i haven used them but they seemed great so far out of the box 
0,six months after purchase the battery in the speaker stopped holding charge we used it maybe once week and very lightly disappointing especially now that it is out of the return window good speaker aside from that

0,bought the item and scroll button and left button stopped working after about months of use
1,this is waterproof but have not gotten it wet yet it is nice size and has really good sound the blue tooth connectivity is fast 
1,this mouse works as advertised the changing lights on the side of it are what drew me in when browsing for new mouse on amazon don really like the slim feel to it feel like my hand would get tired after using it for extended periods of time also was looking for specifically usb mouse and to make this one work with usb you have to use the included adapter which ends up sticking out quite ways on the edge of your computer this is clearly stated in the advertisement just didn pay enough attention when bought the mouse 
1,i had been using friend charge and liked it so was looking at the charge and when bought mine the charge is little bit bigger and has better louder sound was very happy with my purchase like that it has aux port and bluetooth capabilities use both features teach zumba class and don have to charge it too often it plenty loud and doesn need to be plugged in for class

1,this keyboard is amazing it came well packaged like high quality item and feel like the little details matter when buying product love the extra effort they made with the thick papered high quality small envelope that had decals and stuff in it the leds are bright and the keys are very quite it also has holes in the bottom which is nice if you accidentally spill something on it it has great wireless range my desktop is hooked up to my tv and the couch is about ft away and has no connection problems overall this is an amazing value for the low price and ll continue buying from this company as expand my home business into larger business

0,good
0,nothing really to say it didn work with my macbook
0,i got the usb receiver but no mouse in the box 
1,kids said they look like an awesome space set they love their new gaming headsets 
1,although they have different version of their keyboard where you can change the lighting scheme would have love to purchase this one with the ability to do that as well as offering it with mouse combo 
0,the controller needs to be close to the ps because of the short length of the cable can even adjust the length of it sos have to play extremely close to the tv and ps and it uncomfortable to hold 
1,loved it until the wheel quit after five months
1,great audio and good microphone quality works better with noise cancellation 
0,worst mouse ever it double clicks when do not want it to the mouse barely moves and is jerky when used and often makes the cursor slide to the upper right of the screen without me moving the mouse 
1,so far it works well for what do which is just playing online with my friends but the mic works well and the sound quality is very good it the first headset ve ever bought but satisfied with the purchase 
1,i bought these head phones for my year old grandson and he loves them he loves the noise canceling feature and the lighting up in blue is an extra bonus 
1, in all honesty there is very little practical value added by colorful light changes for mouse but you know what in this time of the pandemic we can all use bit of quirky and interesting little patches of fun and joy especially visually this little mouse got the gold color because it was the least expensive at the time always brings smile btw it is quiet no noisy clicks the color is beautiful and classic and the feel is very ergonomic and no stress on the hand and fingers if you re still on the fence get one or more if you want to give yourself little and very useful treat 
1,came ready to use starting using straight from box it is convenient and ergonomic friendly 
0,i liked the color and the lights but unfortunately the scroll wheel went out on me this item only lasted me little over months 
1, love it for the pool and parties love the colour and the quality of the sound previously got bose but preferred to give it to my mother and keep this green one 
1,great wireless mouse super quiet clicks 
0,so easy to hold just plug in the wireless receiver and turn on the power switch on the bottom of the mouse and start using no batteries to install because the mouse is wireless 
1,this is nice little keyboard was purchasing for typing not gaming the keys are quiet seemed to be responsive but just didn care for how short it was while using my wrist rest had to angle my hands downward to reach the keys if you don use wrist rest than would recommend this keyboard 
1,updated the customer service is amazing and so thanks to them was able to get replacement that is much more comfortable and even better sound quality
0,i suppose shouldn have expected much for the money 
1,this keyboard feels really smooth and the rainbow backlit feature works really well highly recommend this keyboard to those looking for wireless keyboard that they want to use for gaming or for other reasons 
1,awesome headphones my kids love them 
1,i love the speaker and have one already in this case had to get one for friend with amzn for specific reason but the price charged is grossly over priced could have gotten one at walmart for all day long but had to use amzn for friend why does amzn allow this level of gouging other wise perfect speaker for my purposes

1,the mouse is great the install was very easy just plug it in and it is ready to use love the changing lights on the mouse if anyone wants led wireless mouse this is the mouse to purchase 
1,i bought one to try for myself at home and loved it so much ordered two more to use at work this is the best wireless mouse ve ever had great value too 
1,so far have been satisfied with the keyboard and would recommend it to others the one issue is the special cord to recharge the keyboard and the ability to match the lighting to my laptop do understand the limits on the battery life that prevent the keyboard from staying active all the time but would like to be able to dim the keyboard when inactive but with the light still bright enough or at least marker key to engage the lights to make it easier to see in the dark it may be little nit picky but the purpose of the lights is to allow me to see and enjoy the back lights while playing and not have to stop and turn on light just to re orient my self to the keys while trying to immerse myself in game 
1,great speaker and great seller only con have found with this speaker is only having driver speaker it looses the stereo effect of the charge which has two very slightly smaller speakers the low tones are better and deeper the charge but it looses alot of high tones the charge picks them up great ll be ordering in near future to link with the for full rounded sound but the bass is lot better with the still really good sound and great volume eith the 
1,it very comfortable to wear and is has great audio output
0,the battery life on it is crap you have to recharge it every few hours it not worth the hassle when it charged it also has some pretty bad lag or just doesn move the cursor the way you move the mouse 
1,sound quality is pretty good for the price higher end products have better clarity but well worth it for kids
0,cheap quality and it broke quickly save your money for something more durable
1,great product
0,bought months ago now have to charge it every other day 
0,the sound is fine but the mic is not good 
1,it was important for me to have mouse that not only could see in the dark but something that was quiet also enjoy the fact that this mouse is rechargeable so this mouse will last me for the long run the light up feature is huge plus something didn know would appreciate since tend to work on my laptop in the dark great quality overall 
1,love the sleek design easy set up fast charging and most importantly how quiet the mouse isit not the most ergonomic mouse and it lacks wrist support so have to stretch lot more but as long as you re not gaming this mouse is great 
0,scroll wheel completely stopped working after two months the power cord also stopped charging the mouse after few weeks of use complete waste of money

0,wish hadn missed the return window on this one this mouse does not have range of meters as stated it has difficulty tracking at just meter or even couple of feet away this was supposed to replace mouse from another seller that also had trouble with it turned out to be the same exact mouse it disheartening to find out that multiple companies are selling the same useless products would recommend spending little more money on mouse from reputable brand 
0,so far ok needs bluetooth up grade
0,ordered specific bluetooth keyboard based on youtube review this one came up but didn show the name it looked like the one search but it cheap dongle only full sized keyboard misleading advertising 
1,very comfortable and feels great

1, love it
1,i like this keyboard very much but was hoping for something bit smaller or thinner per se it normal size keyboard little larger than expected 
1,easy to use and easy to connect workes great with my laptop 
0,as soon as took this out of the box knew that was probably going to be sending it back it looks nice in the picture but it is piece of cheap plastic it felt so cheap that just couldn even use it sent it right back 
1,very clean look would recommend again 
0,mouse doesn slide easily sticks and on both my desk surface and my mouse pad you have to click very hard to make selection and the scroll bar is not consistent in speed wouldn purchase this product 
1,as far as gaming is concerned not using it for that using it because have diabetic retinopathy and it helps with seeing the keys the brightness is perfect the battery life have not ran into problem have used it when my computer is docked and several days have gone by without charging it again so to me that great 
1,really comfortable around the ears and very light headset the mic and sound works perfect and for the price it worth buying
1,the only adjustment personally needed to make was learning to work the sleep mode and click the button to wake it back up other than that love this mouse for work the lights on it still work almost months later with no issue the charge on the mouse plugs into standard micro usb cord and the mouse will hold charge with daily use for about days usually just end the evening plugging in to micro usb port and am always good to go grat buy and will replace with the same when the time comes 
0,this product is very disappointing and the advertising for it is suspect while it states that it is compatible with the nintendo switch and box one systems the microphone is not compatible with either unless you pay and extra for an adapter to make the microphone work the worst thing though is the return window you have like weeks to return it then you are stuck with it spent two weeks trying to get it to work and figuring out whether it was worth it to pay for the adapter now am stuck with these useless things very very disappointing it is definitely worth it to pay more money for better product that is actually compatible with the systems it says it is compatible with 
0,work well 
0,literally did not work pure garbage
0,first one broke in week they sent replacement and returned broken one and it still hasn processed return now new one broke weeks later would not recommend this mouse
1,i like the weight of the board and the key action only wish you could change the lighting
0,i had this mouse before without the led lights worked like charm but despite this version that says the led lights are able to turn off they don the switch on the bottom to shut off the lights do not work the on button shuts off the whole mouse instead of just the lights so basically stuck with annoying flashing lights 
0,so got this to replace my drab old keyboard and glad did the fact that it rechargeable was big sell for me and the very light texture feel nice to touch the only problem though not game changer for me having is that the main enter button feels further away or maybe it smaller than what used to but overall it thumbs up

1,i purchased this keyboard last year in november and have been very satisfied with it performance it is comfortable to type on and the different color backlighting is cool but it would be better if the sleep mode didn take effect so soon this is an issue when in dim room because it can be bit difficult to see the opaque lettering before pressing on that first key to activate the lights additionally recently the keyboard was only staying on if it was connected to the charging cable it came with and last week it began shutting off intermittently even while connected that should have alerted me to the fact that it was cable issue and not battery issue but it didn and contacted klim customer service lolita the customer service agent responded quickly and one of the suggestions given was to try different cable but she also reiterated that there was year warranty should none of the suggestions resolve the issue charging with different cable that already had in my possession worked and am now utilizing the keyboard again without having to be connected am extremely happy with this product and their customer service and would not hesitate to order one of their other products should need one in the future

0,the good has separate usb dongle that stores away and charges internally ie no need for battery the bad the mouse tracking is very erratic too fast too slow and could not find setting that suited me but what renders it unusable for me is the click latency have to click multiple times on anything to get it to work or end up dragging something don mean to some people may also find this mouse bit too small ymmv up to one taste how they like the changing colors on the mouse light display either just red or it switches colors wish you could turn it off though which unfortunately you can 
1,ordered shortly after christmas and once arrived had issues connecting after realizing my only route to get it to work was to constantly turn the mouse on and off after less than week and one charge it will no longer do anything no lights no power no connection and won charge with the included cord or any other spend the money on different brand this was like ordering from wish 
1,i was looking for mouse to replace my old wireless one with which the scroll wheel wasnt working anymore and found this one am pleasantly surprised by this mouse the click is very quiet yet there is satisfying tactile feel to it though the right click can be bit sensitive but nothing too major think the best feature of this mouse is that it is rechargeable very convenient the mouse can be used while charging and only took about hours to fully charge there is led indicator that turns off to show when the mouse is done charging the mouse will also go into sleep mode after minutes of inactivity to save power overall great mouse 
1,i didn buy it for gaming but love it 
1,the headset works great and looks awesome 
0,the mouse was decent for the price however now just about weeks out of my return window and the scroll stopped working on the mouse days ago was hoping it was random temporary issue but it seems it permanent disappointed that can at least return or exchange the item and now have to go and buy new mouse 
0,wish it came with more detailed user manual it can do things not mentioned in the booklet
1,love the red it won get dirty easily purchased white before that and realized the plastic on the sides and bottom will turn yellow over time so ended up returning the white 
1,did work perfect bought it for my boyfriend in may now is july and is acting up with the noise in the headset 
1,love this mouse work excellent 
1,it is an amazing headphone and has the best audio
0,there is supposed to be charger included no charger or even user manual was included 
1,it really lives up to the silent clicking making it comfortable in way the batter also seems to last quite few days if you turn it off when it not in use it also has various light patterns when you click the button in the middle the silent clicking is what really gets me 
1,great for the boat camping apartment etc connection via bluetooth is easy not much to say besides you get what they advertise 
0,poor sound quality cuts in and out and sounds staticky crackly 
1,great product would highly recommend 
0,ordered this and received on while the audio quality wasn high end by any stretch husband was happy with the way these felt and sounded in terms of my usage he used them for gaming and online chat but the microphone on off switch has broken after days of use rendering this headset completely useless for its intended purpose my husband has resorted to taping and gluing up the headset which was broken and unwearable because that headset still works this one not so much 
0,my mouse is not working properly just purchased it not even week ago sending it back
1,this comes exactly as described it works great and is easy to recharge
1,great 
0,i bought this because it was rechargeable and for the ergonomic design after using it for awhile plugged it in charged it worked for awhile then it would only work for few hours then not at all when plugged it in noticed that had to move the connection where it plugs into the device to the left then it would light up but if let go nothing would not recommend this product 
1,the box was torn and there is scratch smudge on it hope it works well the colors are beautiful though love how the white mouse looks it very clean stars because of the smudge can get off and packaging it obvious not the first one to own it 
1,very nice new jbl packaging with directions it normal size not small not huge looks just like the picture color is accurate comes with charger takes long time to charge overall jbl is my favorite portable speaker 
1,i love this mouse easy to set up easy to use it seems to go forever on one charge and the ever changing light color is really cool 
1,great product great customer service great battery life it cool and amazing keyboard
0,this is the second time have ordered this mouse actually really like the mouse except for the fact that they keep breaking and have to order new one so for that reason am only going to give you two stars ordered this particular mouse only two months ago and it already broken should get my money back 
1,it is good speaker the sound quality is great no complains about it it feels really good built and the bass is great but the volume it is not as good as thought would be not bad at all because of the speaker size the batery time claims to be hours of playtime but havent try for that long yet but in general terms it is good speaker

1,my yr old loves this gaming headset purchased these after the wires in his last one tore up was over buying headsets until came across these with the thick cable cord instead of the thin plastic wire cord decided to give it try after reading several reviews glad that did the mic is clear the cord is thicker and the headset lights up blue to match my son gaming keyboard and mouse great reviews from kids and adults fast shipping and at very affordable price do not pass this up 
0,good

1,these work great for the online gaming do they are comfortable on my ears and the sound is great

1,the overall sound quality is nice and loud indoors but when outside the sound doesn travel as far as you would think but for the size of the speaker was really impressed with the output overall when paired with nd device got the sound needed and wanted outdoors this is great product the portability is amazing because of the size and the durability is awesome

0,pretty easy to use and set up comes with charger expected the lights to be bit more appealing but they re mainly just solid colors when you have it on the led light mode fits snug with my hands and does the job for the most part so complain probably wouldn use for gaming purposes though

1,i had already buy one for myself and this one was gift to my best friend he really enjoy it and still thinks that was one of the best presents ever 
0, at first really liked this mouse it was lightweight and had sleek design it ended there every time go to use the mouse throughout the day have to return it on even when it already in the on position anyone that is used to any other type of wireless mouse and you just use it anytime will quickly become annoyed with this mouse the fact that you have to flip the switch on and off every time you go to use it makes it poor choice

0,loved it until it stopped working and wouldn charge in couple months now just junk 
1,fast shipping great price awesome new high quality bluetooth speaker at great discount
1,great brand speaker has lot of bass perfect for home or on the go in my opinion this speak tops the beats pill 
0,computer
1,from the several bluetooth speakers ve owned for nearly years this significantly has the clearest and best quality sound of them all notice that percussion is distinctively clearer from any bluetooth speaker ve heard as well jbl always delivers top notch durable product 
1,comfortable with great sound and mic quality definitely recommend
1,this mouse has been so much better on my wrists it sleek new design makes it easier to sit all day without the need to move to another position to relieve the strain on my wrist love the rechargeable aspect because no longer need to struggle with the endless supply of battery replacements it is so easy to sync up and was ready to go right away so many colors to choose from too 
1,i love the colors of the led lights and it works great 
1,the design is beautiful the led lights make the mouse look amazing specially in dark places love the fact that it doesn make click sound it charges very fast and it lasts very long great price for such great product 
1,really good speaker battery life is pretty good as well super easy to connect via bluetooth and also to connect to other charge speakers
0,everyone says sound far away or in tunnel
1,the headset barely fit on my head after constant adjustment and tweaking would have to put pair of socks on top of my head in order for it to be comfortable and fit 
1,it sleek and comfortable and the battery lasts forever once charged it great and it fits anywhere 
1,i use this keyboard for work and my job involves typing hours day have showed it off to everyone it is very quiet smooth and they keys are soft was definitely impressed rating
1,mouse works well and is good value for the inexpensive price 
1,i got this specifically since it was smaller than the gaming mouse had this slim mouse feels nicer in my hand the only thing is that occasionally the cursor lags jumps bit but it doesn happen too often otherwise love that it chargeable and wireless don keep the flashy lights on too often to conserve the battery nice cheap mouse 
0,originally not happy couldn get the speaker to work my grandson was so disappointed after trying several different things we finally got the speaker to work and my grandson is gaming with his friends definitely worth the money 
0,i haven used the sleep mode and don do gaming
1,best speaker ive ever gotten
0,i thought going up to the jbl would be better but was disappointed with the sound quality as it didn sound as full the base wasn there not as full as the jbl should have purchased another jbl 
1,this is the second jbl bluetooth speaker have bought used to buy bose but the jbl sound quality and battery life are awesome bose is great product but jbl is the way to go for the money
1,it really nice exactly what wanted except when it changes in light it does automatically and the transition is bit glitchy at times but still love it 
0,when listening while doing chores it needs to carry through every room and this speaker does the trick through dog barks and other household noises can still hear the song or speaker the only drawback is that the bluetooth does not connect to other generations of jbl speakers threes connect only with other threes fours connect only with fours it would not have changed my particular purchase and circumstance but will affect my future purchases because will match the system for linking 
0,mouse is fine but needs frequent charging
0,it broke the same day
1,i don really like the long cord wish it was cordless
0,i ordered these for myself my current headset just reached the end of it life and needs replaced these appeared similar and were near the same in price but oh boy the quality first off unless you have an extremely tiny head or are child these are not for you the ear cuffs are absurdly small had my japanese roommate try them on and even he laughed at how ridiculously tiny they were there no way you could wear these for any length of time without getting headache from the pressure to your ears but hey maybe they ll sound great and can get past that nope the audio was muffled and quiet had to turn my volume up five fold to hear anything compared to my worn out set the set that literally falling part sound better come on all of this comes after waiting much longer delivery time than quoted by almost week and when the package did arrive it was crushed headset seemed unharmed but with the sound quality who knows maybe that factor can say all can say is that these are absolute junk 
1,used it to video chat during online games works great
1,great product works good durable sounds good 
0,it okay not quiet at all
1, wish would have seen the video from another reviewer with the white mouse before purchased the white one don like the fact that the light is visible throughout the whole mouse assumed it would just be line of light that circles the mouse as shown in the sellers pictures if you like the look of the whole mouse lighting up as shown in the video then this is the mouse for you overall do like the mouse and don want to deal with exchanging planned on getting the mint and should have gone with my instincts it glides smoothly and the clicks are slient won be returning it because do like it but just diappointed the white one was not as shown described
0,i like the look and feel of this mouse however the fact that you have to charge it is kind of pain it doesn make it through full work day so usually by the end of thebday have to plug in my wired mouse 
1,y all now know that haven had this keyboard long at all weeks but it is game changer the sound of the keys isn too loud but it not so soft that you feel unproductive love the way that the keys actually feel when am typing the color of the keyboard is great too would purchase this keyboard at full price all over again if had to primeday
1,have been eyeball this one for years love the pink color looks exactly as it does in the picture 
1,just plugged it in and it worked perfectly wanted small low profile mouse to use when travel so far this one seems great the chromebook travel with only has usb ports and did think that that this mouse came with usb receiver but it doesn it comes with usb receiver and an adapter which works fine but together they are over an inch long which is little awkward it means have to be very careful not to bump it and beak it if the receiver were smaller this would be ideal overall great value 
1,love this speaker it lightweight enough to carry around the house and to travel with can wait to use it at the beach and pool this summer 
1,i really love this keyboard for the price could not have asked for better one 
0,it was for my grandson and no complaints from him so guess it is fine
0,careful it not bluetooth had to order my daughter new one an kept this one for myself 
0,had it for one month and not working 
1,great value for the money for an illuminated wireless keyboard very responsive 
1,i needed wireless mouse and specifically wanted one that matched my new laptop this mouse exceeded my expectations love the that it lights up and comes in variety of colors it kinda hard to find silver mouse especially one that is compatible with type usb so am happy 
1,this wireless mouse works great and is easy to set up the led lights gives it nice look and the click is silent the battery last day haven had to change them over all mouse
0,reacts little slow
1,my son really enjoyed this headset he liked the look they were comfortable and sound was good but the microphone stopped working within months 
0,this thing literally started skipping after minutes of use
0,sounds good so far
0,home computer use not gaming 
1,this mouse is gorgeous it is so quiet and feels great in my hand it synced with my laptop with ease do feel the charge doesn last as long as like but you can use it while it charging which is nice definitely recommend 
0,the rose gold color is very pretty and the color changing effect was nice at first but after about an hour of use the colors started to glitch the back end of the mouse was staying yellow and the front continued to change colors there is an option to turn the colors off but you end up with red light that shows up randomly while moving the mouse around it will get the job done but also feels very cheap compared to logitech or name brand get what you pay for in this case 
0,it good for gaming the only way it lights up is if you plug the usb into your laptop or charger adapter also use it for my phone but it has shortage 
1,this is the best speaker have ever had 
1,i love the water resistance long battery high volume and bass for such small speaker also the ability to charge my phone off of it is great just wish it was tad bit smaller and dedicated forward back buttons but otherwise exceptional 
0,i bought you can hear anything on either one of them my husband daughter play xbox with each other in separate rooms but neither one could hear the other he replaced his with turtle beach she would try to use both to see if either one would work he could never hear her she couldn hear him we replaced hers with turtle beach also now they just sit 
1,i love this head set so much you can hear great it has not broke at all 
0,the good the price and they work the bad very short coord more suited for laptop user than desktop requires both usb and mm ports to be used for either to work disconnect one and headset stops very poor sound its too quiet forget noise cancellation you can hear your phone ring on medium with these on full sound on youtube for some reason the left ear is hotter than the right side assuming because mic is on the left side have bought headphones half this price from sades that had much better sound and coord length but sadly they didnt have red and black anymore should of went with blue and black this headset was twice as expensive and nothing to be happy about will not buy another from this company
1,i bought this mouse because needed wireless mouse for work it came in cheap box written in mostly chinese it is nice color and it was easy to setup used this for work for weeks and today went to use it and it stopped working it didn register on the computer am sending this back for refund and ll just get logic tech 
1,my daughter loves these for gaming with her xbox one she likes the idea they light up and they have never given her any issues no she is able to connect and play with friends
1,love it 
1,i wish could hear myself in my headphones but beyond that great for the price sound quality is good not great and mic is clear
0,broke after one month went to plug it in and the charging port pushed way back inside the mouse and when opened the mouse up to fix it the piece had busted off completely 
0,ther is nothing bad to say about these headphones
0,looks like the track wheel is connected to an internal device using very fragile thin piece of plastic was simply using the mouse didn drop it or slam it and suddenly the tactile feedback of using the track wheel stopped and the mouse would no longer scroll the screen too bad actually liked the mouse until then 
1,these have been pretty good so far really good deal for the price 
0,this mouse will not stay connected to my computer
1,i am looking for more than decent little camping speaker haven run the battery down completely only listening to it for about hours first thing noticed listening to few different types of music is that it got little to no low end you start to lose everything at around hz not looking to blow the doors off of anything but want little more than this can give the build quality feels super sturdy and it gets pretty loud for its size it can definitely fill my studio apartment 
1,the design is beautiful the led lights make the mouse look amazing specially in dark places love the fact that it doesn make click sound it charges very fast and it lasts very long great price for such great product 
1,my son loves them 
0,garbage returning it volumn keys do not work light is underneath the keys and do not light up the letters numbers and symbols printing on keys are too small and unreadable unless you have very young eyes returning it 
0,for the price it good to use for gaming with other players over the ps system
1,very cheaply made it was the biggest waste of my money the piece that plugs into the usb port broke in weeks time as was taking it out of the port it can be glued back together but it would have to be done with precision and carefulness not to get glue all over it dont know that its worth it guess this is one of those things that its just better off going with the brand you trust and paying that little bit extra for something you know is not going to come apart because it was poorly constructed it was pretty cool how it lights up it is very lightweight as well which will leave that to your own interpretation 
0,one hell of speaker
1,i use this at work and it bumps love that can just toss it in my bag and go with it even set it up in my car spilled water in my bag and of course the jbl was fine still learning new things about it haven tested it outside yet but so far it perfect ve been using it for about almost months now 
0,got this couple months back arrived broken could not talk to others but could hear others requested refund and was told replacement will come in week or two never got replacement will never buy mic off amazon again 
0,the microphone barely detects audio if you re talking at volume any less than screaming painfully uncomfortable to wear with glasses and the sound quality isn much better than my old headset which ve had for years even for only expected something could use for at least minutes before it gave me headache 
1,easy to set up connect happy with this product
0,i had the mouse working for one day then could not use it any further the mouse pointer had mind of it own and would take over it own movement what disappointment was hoping not to go back to battery operated mouse say do not buy this product 
0,put one star because this store sent me bad mouse twice the first was working then not working the next did not work at all just wasted time and money 
0,stopped tracking well after week of use waste of money spend little more and get better quality mouse to begin with with

0, it not working after setting up to my laptop but the colors do show up tried to take out the usb and plugging it back again but it doesn seem to work 
0,long lasting power recharges fast
0,mouse works great when you first plug it in but if you wait few minutes it will lag so much your better off using the laptop mouse disappointed in these high reviews because mine does not work 
0,i only used it for week and the scroller stopped working
1,it is ok for beginner headset or for your kid who plays and he probably gonna break it after couple weeks but other than that you pretty much get what you pay for it made out of cheap material and feels like it anyone who plays lot it probably not what your looking for 
1,works fantastically would just like it to be bit louder but overall great product 
1,sound is very good for single speaker with excellent bass response an adjustable eq vis phone app would be nice but still sounds great where this thing shines is battery life ve had it for few months and am still working on the first chafe and use this speaker daily 
1,for the price they are great but could be slightly better before these had some over priced turtle beach ones they were slightly better than these in terms of sound quality but buy these again for the price
0,even didn lat month broken poor quality 
1,it works fine however sometimes it does not response when you move your hand also do not recognize when the dpi is activated or not also when you click the bottom it does not response so you have to press it more than one time for it works also it is felt very plastic 
1,i initially loved this mouse liked the fact could recharge it instead of batteries however after the first week it just stopped working have recharged it and still nothing 
1,really great for the mouse really light and wow just passed my expectations would buy again 
0,i bought this as wireless mouse have used it for less than month and it doesn hold charge unless it plugged in will be returning it and do not recommend this product 
0,this broke after day 
1,kids like the sound and they last quality good 
1,update not sure why but this mouse is working better than it did when originally purchased it back in october use it every day and don mind charging it over night every couple of days or so it is comfortable to use and kind of funky in good way to use the changing lights feature from time to time naturally this will make the battery run down faster but once in while enjoy the light show lol and love how the click is so quiet they say they ve upgraded this product so hope you ll give it try too original review october my use of this mouse consists of following hours of use without the pretty little alternating lights on and then it switched off for the night before my next hours are over this thing runs out of life and must be charged again not at all thrilled with it it does have nice quiet click but if have to charge it every time use it don think it will last very long 
0,stopped working after couple months 
0,looks beautiful but couldn get it to sink to my macbook air saddened
1,love this thing easy to use really light good feel to the keys nice and quiet wonderfully helpful small company that makes affordable and well made equipment

0,the headphones are pretty and worked well in the beginning but now there echo don know why and what happened but the suck now 
0,the quality and dont like the usb cord

0,the clicker won work any more because the rolling piece broke
0,the mouse can use but the back side of the light is broke 
1,boyfriend loves it for his gaming 
1,this thing knocks great sound quality this is the nd one ve purchased and love it 
1,for the price paid for this headset it amazing it actually the closest to the more expensive high quality headset that have found so far it pretty good at blocking out background noise the sound effects and voices are clear to hear and can go pretty loud if you choose to turn the volume up it sits quite comfortably on my head have smaller head as female and also wear glasses when gaming so was thoroughly surprised to find there wasn too much pressure on my glasses or my ears would highly recommend this headset

0, months later my keyboard just stopped working as was typing thought it needed to be charged but even after charging it would not turn on after many attempts to get it going again by turning it off and on it would work bur for few minutes and then go all dark and become unresponsive would have rated it high as it was excellent when it worked but now it is useless

1,love everything about the speaker wish it came with bag to make it easy to take with me on trips 
1,i bought my first pair about year ago loved them and constantly used them for all kinds of things related to my computer the first pair had perfect sound quality and loved the threaded wire as it made it less likely to knot tangle and wrap up again getting my second pair as the first pair wore down from over full year of daily use do notice they made some changes and the changes are excellent the headphones fit nicer on my head and cancel more noise for better sound quality it nice to see quality changes get better over time these headphones are especially great for those who play videogames great quality comfortable and looks great 
1,the sound quality is perfect bluetooth and the battery it last long 
1,my son needed new pair of gaming headphones and these were steal great price for great quality my son loves them and said they re better than his last pair 
0,doesn hook up to my xbox don say that something can connect to something if it doesn that false advertisement 
0,i loved this mouse until is stopped working after months 
1,product came as described year old son says it works great purchased for gaming and solid sound quality 
1,love this keyboard don have anything bad to say about it congratulations to the work team they did good job putting this together love the colors works perfectly worth your money 
1,these are pretty great the mic works well and there are no problems with the audio now it been few months and they are still working the same it even looks good 
1,i love this keyboard
0,seamless connectivity to my pc
0,battery doesn last and stopped working after days very disappointed if could return it would don buy not worth it 
0,i bought this mouse thinking it would be good mouse for my mac when opened it it took many attempts to connect and then it kept draining all of its battery every night do not buy this mouse its quality is very cheap overall bad purchase will be returning this
0,sound quality speaking and hearing are excellent but definitely not meant for consoles the usb and aux jack are right next to each other so no led lights for console players 
0,worked for months then quit working
1,i love the color love the sound it easy to synch up 
1,if you re single mom like me and don want to buy some expensive headphones for your year old gamer child you have this one work great and are affordable my son has been using it for the longest time 
1,this came so safely packaged so it wouldn break recommend getting this good sound connects easily and the battery lasts long good for listening loud music 
1,the mouse is colorful addition to my desk and unlike other computer mice have owned it does not have thumb operated controls on its left side where left handed person like myself would unintentionally press button and start function they didn want to activate ve only had it for about week so it remains to be seen how frequently it needs to be recharged the light display draws significant amount of power so need to remember to turn the mouse off whenever shut down the pc 
0,the first headset received was busted the sound barely worked in only one ear piece so sent it back in for new one the return receiving for the new headset was easy and quick now the bad part the headset is lower quality than the description let on felt that the headset sound wasn the worst definitely step up from an earbud headset the mic however doesn past any quality test of mine have always had an easy time of speaking to my team friends but after getting this they could barely hear me they described it as if were across the room trying to speak into the mic obviously wasn was disappointed with my purchase definitely going to purchase new headset from more reputable company 
1, needed new cheap mouse and this was on sale and read through lot of reviews saw lot of reviews stating that there was chance that the white version could potentially not be solid white allowing for the lights to show through the mouse through the top well that sounded cool to me so ordered white hoping that mine would also do the same pleased to report that it does so be warned that ordering the white version has chance to do this and apparently often find it fun though also happy to note that there is an inactivity timer on the mouse so when not in use it will conserve it battery power by turning off clicking with the mouse will turn it back on battery life has been good so far too work from home for hrs day and it survives my work day easily just plug it up to charge after work 
1,i really like that it comes with usb adapter saved my life because the new macbooks aren compatible with usb over all really nice mouse fits in my hand perfectly and love the lights on it 
1,i got this for my mother because she wanted something pink and cheap it really feels like its made of trash it does seem to work well enough though the tracking is inconsistent at best the ergonomics are really non existent doesn seem like it made for human hands overall if you re buying for somebody who wants something cheap and pink and cant tell the difference go for it but if you actually care about having half decent mouse skip this one 
1,perfect
0,they re good headphones however the headphone jack constantly pops out and ve had to coat it in an adhesive to ensure it didn it annoys me very much especially when gaming 
0,the headset works of the time don waste your time and money on this it cheap for reason 
1,it perfect love it
0,i had this mouse before without the led lights worked like charm but despite this version that says the led lights are able to turn off they don the switch on the bottom to shut off the lights do not work the on button shuts off the whole mouse instead of just the lights so basically stuck with annoying flashing lights 
0,good sound quality and battery life
1,excellent keyboard
1,bought for my yo and he loves them the led lights look super cool 
1,literally best speaker out there amazing battery life and sound will blow ur house up if it maxed 
0,loses connection lot sitting no more than from computer screen 
0,update seller has sent multiple emails asking me to remove this review in exchange for money claiming this is an email from amazon costumer service this is the nd purchase for me the first one wasn labeled upgrade it lasted about months until dropped it on the floor this one the upgrade doesn work well at all the left and right click are very touchy and the scrolling drags and skips across pages the connectivity was also delayed despite trying different computers and different settings the problems persisted returned the upgrade 
1,outstanding customer service had question and received an immediate response and resolution love this mouse and would recommend it to others 
1,great speaker very loud decent bass maybe bit more volume but overall satisfied 
1,very functional and estetically pleasing very quick wireless connection even via kvm only con is that it doesn sense and light up when your fingers approach kb like the logitech k
1,great product for the price my son loves it no complaints 
0,crap quality several keys fell off when it was being stored not even in use and are now lost rendering the keyboard useless down the drain

0,sound quality is not that great don be fooled it cheap plastic is fragile mic broke off 
1,excellent purchase provides great back lighting for typing in low or no light situations great feel to the keys and excellent range have been using for days now on the initial charge and am very happy with the power capacity so far highly recommend 
1,while it isn on par with some of the more expensive headsets out there for the value that it was give discounted this is good pair of headsets that helps for those that want to get into the video gaming craze this pair of headphones is big so size should be covered for those with big round heads while the game audio is bit filled with bass at times the quality outside of that is really good and the size comes to an advantage again as it helps with noise cancellation both in mic and in speakers if you can get the same deal did recommend it for first timer 
1,this is def noise cancellation always in full house and was happy not to hear noise
0,this mouse is clunky as it would at times not connect however ordered it in march and now in april the mouse no longer works do lot but 
0,the metal casing for the usb remote came off and is now stuck in the usb port of my computer
1,i really love this little mouse as it is easy to use and can put it in safe mode so don have to keep recharging it and saving on having to buy batteries my laptop is used primarily for embroidery files so don use it for gaming and can address that 
1,i bought bought it as gift for my husband but use it sometimes it not too loud very portable he loved that we take it to the beach with us every time we go easily connects to bluetooth the battery last very good while my only dislike was that when vacuum doesn play loud enough to hear it over the noise of my vacuum

0,not functional for gaming if the charge doesn last 
0,gift
1,i have been using this mouse for couple of weeks now love the rechargeable feature and the battery seems to last long time never turn it off highly recommend this one 
1,i would not recommend this product at all it cheap for reason it rarely works while it looks nice its performance is very poor in each box they ll include little flier saying you ve won free product to receive it you need to leave good review while they do indeed follow through and give you the product it harmless scam to get positive reviews for their bad products spend the money on better product 
0,loved everything about this mouse until the charging jack came loose after three months of use there is no way to charge it now guess you get what you pay for 
1,it good product for gaming headset not too pricey and the sound quality is good 
0,disappointed no usb or booklet supplied

0,i had one of these already so wanted to get second one to tie into the others it will not stay on for more than seconds it will not take charge have run the factory reset process several times with success for about one week then have speaker with no charge again 
1,well worth the money little bigger so it is louder and links up easily with other jbl speakers
1,this thing was worth every penny cannot believe the sound that comes from this tiny speaker very impressed 
0,the only problem had with this item is that it doesn charge 
0,it was working well until it just stopped working after months it won charge and turn on anymore pretty much useless now not well made and it waste of money if you re looking for reliable and and an item that will last long do not get this one coz you will be disappointed tried my luck and didn listen to the reviews read now am so disappointed could have spend more to most reliable and long lasting one

0,this mouse was extremely cheap
1,got itand time and my grandson loves it
1,stopped working within week had hoped for better 
0,i was concerned that this would be difficult to setup but was shocked on how easy it was to connect 
0,i decided to start write reviews because of these speakers literally when you get something from internet based on people reviews you should take this one seriously base very load without losing quality the sound is incredible fast connection and very very long battery life and real waterproof
1,this thing is awesome great sound good battery life 
1,i gave this to my sweetie for christmas two days ago got call from him today telling me in detail how he had set it up and used his additional jbl bluetooth speaker with it as well he can be quite the critic being an manager but he could only say wonderful things about how easy it was operate and the quality of sound that was achieved with one small speaker thank you jbl for making my gift to my guy very special one 
0,liked the keyboard but as have large hands was not good fit for me 
0,small lightweight yet firm solid feel led lighting is nice touch shuts off automatically once laptop or pc is shutdown however the main reason purchased was because of the silent feature sadly it not as silent as had hoped clicks are still audible especially on scroll wheel which is disappointing why cant someone make truly silent mouse have yet to find one as most silent mice are merely muffled by rubber lining shame would be perfect otherwise
0,product did not move smoothly across the mouse pad and did not fit my hand particularly well 
1,great item
1,i purchased this mouse for my laptop due to the ease of having mouse verse mouse pad this mouse is very easy to use rechargeable and the lights makes it easy to find 
1,i liked this headset originally very comfortable the sound was good everyone could hear and understand me then the audio got really choppy not great long term investment if you want to use the mic 
0,i am updating my review of this headset received an updated gaming headset from the vendor the issues that had had have been corrected with the new headset am extremely pleased with my new product the company has done an outstanding job to solve my initial issue please ignore my previous review that is below one of the issues is that the headphones were sized for young kid and expanding them did not help that much the sound quality was fine but noise cancellation was not adequate 
0,its nice
0,i bought different one of these in the fall and it worked for short time thought was buying from different company this time but this mouse also has failed me do not buy this mouse charged it and still nothing 
0,this keyboard worked for months one day it just stopped working walked away to get drink came back and none of the keys worked it would light up for second and turn off tried trouble shooting resetting and nothing helped 
1,great battery life and put water on the bass part and it didn damage the speaker at all instead it made pretty cool effect when played song with heavy bass
1,this speaker has amazing sound quality and is such an upgrade from my phone speaker use it in my home but it is also compact enough to be great for travel taking to the pool the beach and more my only complaint is that the battery life seems little short so often bring little portable charger for it on the go 
0,the mic didn last very long until it started having problems also you can move the mic around so people can hear you 
0,the scroll feature on the mouse broke weeks after the return period otherwise like it

1,it good size for the work it does great price
1,wow you really can go wrong with this mouse bought it for work since they still have the wired mouse but the traction is horrible with this replacement no wires no cables only to charge it the traction is great very responsive 
1,note ve owned these for over six months shopped for bluetooth speakers bose pricing is insane jbl had the charge the charge on amazon the charge models seemed to be very similar based on the item description so went with this charge it was less expensive glad did don use this often but every time do surprised by the sound quality sounds great the batteries last for long time sometimes have bit of difficulty switching from macbook streaming to iphone streaming or vice versa but sure it operator error regardless it can be done and quite satisfied with the purchase these are great by the pool in the summertime 
0,only worked few weeks and thats it waste of money whats worse is barely used it 
1,i love be good sterio gaming headset because high quality sound and bass in the headset is so amazing shooting guns while gaming plus hearing stuff behind you in game your are playing also love how you can connect the usb and your headset can light up while you use them
1,it looked like it does in the pic listing says it works with apple no clear directions on using it with the iphone terrible self support and regular support the info of setting up iphone was basically it works on some stuff might work on iphone figure it out yourself the support is none they never contacted me back and couldn get it to work so sent it back worst service ve had on amazon no excuse for not at least responding to support issue steer clear of them they don care about their customers 
1,positive quality great color
1,i bought this keyboard about year ago and have used it extensively with no issues whatsoever up until recently when the bluetooth dongle stopped responding contacted klim customer service to request new dongle because the keyboard itself was in perfect working condition they told me that they were in the process of moving warehouses and it would be faster to send me new keyboard they shipped an entirely new keyboard within few days am beyond astounded at how fantastic their customer service is did not ask for new keyboard yet they offered one just to make me satisfied customer plan on using klim products from hereon in whenever need tech that they sell highly recommend this company and applaud how excellent their customer service is

0,does not recharge never did light up as advertised
1,just what needed use this keyboard at the office as prefer keyboard with raised keys super responsive and works well 
1,i got this speaker to upgrade from my old ue boom well would say the only things it does better is battery life and little more volume when you turn the jbl up to higher volumes while at work you can hear the low end effecting the highs and the speaker is very directional so it very difficult to find location for the speaker that doesn turn it into shrill little squeak box the ue have is much smaller speaker but it has nearly degrees of speakers so it sounds really great from all angles all in all the jbl definitely wasn worth the money sticking with ue 
1,bought this for my teenagers who loves music great sound portable and great charging option highly recommend 
1,the sound quality is really good but the ear piece is little small over all got this for gaming and recommend you should get it

1,excellent product works right out the box
0,goes through batteries like water
1,great gaming headset for my son 
0,i just got it ll update after few weeks of using it 
0,when received this product the first time it had come broken the entire click pad was nearly separated from the base and couldn easily be snapped back into place sent in for replacement and everything was all fine they sent replacement no problems this was in april flash forward to december mere eight months the mechanism that holds the scroll wheel somehow snapped apart and the scroll wheel is now useless which makes playing games bit difficult as many games use the scroll wheel when to contact customer service all contact is closed use caution when ordering this mouse at first the replacement had been sent was good despite it not exactly having any sort of indicator as to when the mouse needed to be charged but if the scroll wheel mechanisms are gonna snap easily under potentially hard gaming sessions perhaps pass for something more heavy duty 
1,bass is good the cord is long comfortable for most people and its pretty solid for gaming it pretty awesome especially for about twenty bucks worth try 
1,it slim and doesn make noise the colors are great wasn expecting much but this mouse really surpassed what thought was going to get to install is super easy the usb is small so it doesn get in the way the mouse is super slim and the scroll works great 
1,you don need the charge this thing is awesome and much cheaper wait till charge is on sale

0,owned jbl for years before it died and played it full volume hours each day didn even think about different brand 
1,i love this speaker lot very clear love the charger option
0,works exactly how needed it to 
1,great speaker provides good sound and lasts long time the reason for the star deduction is because the battery didn last as long as advertised took it on float trip and it died about hours in granted had it turned up max the entire time and it was hot day but think it should have lasted longer also the sound on the float wasn as loud as would have liked it was incredibly sturdy and portable no complaints there 
0,i use this for my laptop speaker great sound but the power is not always easy to maintain used my docking station and it has been struggling when finally move to real charger it works great 
1,bought for my son for christmas and he loves them they are his favorite color and they shine bright he can really hear his friends well when he uses them

1,this mouse was back to school gift for my th grade son it charged fine the first time worked ok never charged again and stopped working school has only been in for one week and he already needs new mouse can give it more that one star if it doesn work 
1,i loved this product it was gift one of the best how can you ask for anything better the quality is awesome the sound is fantastic it easy to use and understand the manual found the light colored devices get dirty quickly that the sucky part no case to keep it clean while it being used the bluetooth compatibility is also keeper getting awesome range as well just for reference the charging port tents to get lose multiple of my friends say the same thing but no worries you won regret it trust me 
1,everything arrived and performs great 
0,the mouse stopped working after days 
0, loved this mouse but after couple of months it started making weird noise while scrolling points for that
1,it fabulous love it sometime when walk away with my phone it drops the round but that probably more my bad love it recommend it specially since got mine on sale 
0,it worked very well till it didn anymore bought this in january and it won charge or do anything very disappointed
0,the mouse works fine it is slim kind of cheap plastic but the lights which in photos look like it would just be thin line around the mouse are very annoying the entire thing lights up you can not turn them off and still use the mouse it is very distracting did not try to return it because there is nothing else wrong but will donate it to charity or someone ordered another one with no lights 
0,i purchased this little over months ago but used it only on the weekends on my personal laptop so not much usage on gaming or extensive clicking immediately noticed the charge does not hold up for less than than weekend days so started turning it off about months later noticed lagging in click response soon after clicks were not engaging replaced it with brand name you get what you pay for but thought should contact the manufacturer and ask for refund or replacement it been over weeks now and no response do not recommend this product or its manufacturer beware 
0,had this mouse for month and the wheel already stopped working
1,so teach prek and we have nap time what caught my attention was the quiet clicker didn think it would be as quiet as it is but it is extremely quiet it also easy to set up and easy to use 
1,likes no noise click lights look cool chargeabledislikes chargeable battery life is very short had to turn off every time don use it or else battery runs out super fast within days after months the charging outlet is broken there no way to fix it now can use it anymore safer to go back to traditional battery mouse which lasts for long time 
1,i bought this for my son recently bought the jbl extreme for myself which he loved but wanted smaller speaker he uses his charge regularly and know it sounds great and we have not had any issues 
1,this is great back up set for when your good headset breaks the more you use this one the worse it gets at first it sounded great the glowed very bright but after few months there was lot of feed back in the mic and the surround sound didn work at all made gaming hard without being able to hear call outs 
1,i really liked this headset the mic is working really great and it feels really comfortable 
1,is not the best have try but for the price works very good and is pretty accurate
0,bought in february already stopped working have headset stand that place them on when done using so it not like they re tossed aside and it not like use them every day either eta customer service sent replacement very nice to work with
1,love it wish the battery and charge battery had diff battery light
0,this product worked only for the first time have charged it and then could not hold any charge have kept it plugged for whole day without success do not waste your money get decent product from decent manufacturer 
1,i got this headset for my year old son it has great surround sound quality the over ears design work well my work from home office shares the same space as my son games in this allows him to game after school quietly and headset cancels the sound of my work conversations they are conform able and work great the
1,my son loves his gaming mouse
0,after two months had lost my mic and now the wire has become disconnected from the headset did say just two months couldn believe it because they had decent reviews 
0,microphone required db to be increased and barely picked up voicing the constant static made my friends go nuts
0,this keyboard is deceptive it really pretty and feels good to use but in about months of use it started having response issues use it for gaming and it would randomly stop responding or lag for few seconds to minutes before recovering it does this regardless of charger status and even when plugged in used it directly next to the receiver and on different machines so it isn the bluetooth on my end or distance affecting it think either the keys lose responsivity or the bluetooth signal is losing connection 
1,mouse is easy to use and works well however the first time put it in my bag the color chipped off the mouse now have teal mouse with white specks super disappointed
0,just got this so far it is amazon love the colors the only thing that is slightly disappointing is how quickly the lights go off when you are not typing wish there was an option to leave the lights on longer 
1,purchased for my son and he really enjoys using them he said the quality is really good very good price for gaming headphones 
1,headset was gift for my son he loves that it lights up 
0,for me really liked the headset not to loud great sound quality and at good price if you re looking for wireless this one is not 
0,product was great just the delivery was horrible this is the first time ve ever had issues they crammed it so tight in my mailbox like to have never gotten it out and could ve damaged my product just by trying to get it outta the mailbox 
0,headphones were decent except didn really cancel out any noise 
0,lacks full sounding bass
1,great mouse like the colors and sleekness also rechargeable 
1,love this thing sounds great good bass for small unit very satisfied 
1,great product for the price haven had any issues at all definitely beats spending hundreds of dollars 
0,gift my son is gamer
0,it is little slippery in the hand but have been using pc mouse 
1,the big debate about this speaker not being stereo like the charge is really mute point when the speakers on the charge are only few inches away from each other anyway not enough stereo separation to make any difference in real world listening environments in my opinion found the sound quality and loudness of the to be very impressive for such small package and would not use the fact that it only has one main speaker in front affect your buying decision at all great little speaker and long battery life just what was looking for

0,worked great until today scroll wheel no longer works this is not even an item use more than three times month disappointing 
1,i really wanted to like this keyboard still do sort of lol the thin form factor lighting and silent keys are really great loved typing on it however after about week of light use and weeks of moderate use for work had to stop using it it would miss key strokes double them up or triple them keys would lag behind it was agonizing to use the battery seemed ok was going to buy the wired version but think ll just move on 
0,reasonably priced and beautiful chroma lighting effects on keyboard the keyboard is indeed silent but somehow the lack of tactile feedback sometimes makes one wonder if the keys had been depressed correctly

0,charged all night and only last few minutes this mouse has pretty design but it too thin to hold just asked for refund but not replaced

0,i got this in june and it now the end of september it was great at first and lasted multiple days on charge but now the battery dies after just couple of hours and it dies randomly without any warning so it always in the middle of using it frustrating this lasted maybe months in totalupdate again month later this is dead and battery lasts few minutes at most even after charging up fully

0,this mouse doesn work it either isn holding charge or it just isn connecting to it own bluetooth 
1,this is my th or th jbl charge that we have purchased either for us or for gift to someone else love how you can connect all of them together for an exceptional sound experience battery life is very long too would highly recommend 
0,i initially really enjoyed this mouse it is good size the battery life is reasonable and sucker for anything that lights up rainbow do wish that you could turn on just the mouse and not the lights without there being constant red light however after using the mouse for less than months the scroll wheel stopped working and can figure out why ve tried cleaning it out recharging the battery and adjusting my driver settings with no luck definitely frustrated and because my return window has past not sure how to reach out to customer service

1,so for anyone wondering charging it is easy if you plug it and the light in the middle is blue that means that it is not fully charged the blue light will turn off after being fully charged mine arrived on monday and on wednesday it turned off plugged it in and took around hours to charge it the light turned off the clicks are silent and is very comfortable to use one thing do not like is the scroller which can be little too hard tend to open many tabs at once at work and while am on pinterest lol but that just me overall is nice mouse and hope it can stay with me forever this is my th mouse in less than year 
0,i seen in the description that it said it would work for xbox one went no further after receiving the head phones we noticed it did not work for xbox one so opened the instructions and there we seen that an adapter is needed for xbox one and it is dont buy these for xbox as between this and the adapter you will spend almost 
1,the product is good and operates well 
1,just great sound for such small speaker haven tested the waterproofness 
1,this product is good for its price the set up was very quick for tech savvy like myself it was easy to figure out its settings and such however when was trying out keyboards shortcuts such as ctrl or ctrl on windows cmd or cmd for macos it wasn working with this keyboard you have to click windows button fn or whatever shortcut you have to pressed to enable its function it took me awhile by pressing random buttons haha hope this helps other consumers

0,love this mouse it the coolest one ve ever had you can go wrong with this item

1,i absolutely love these headphones the mic quality is amazing the sound quality is also amazing 
1,nery nice incredible for the price fits snugg to the head and ears very nice sound and good mic very surprised for the price of blue bought 
1,this keyboard is not silent the keys do click not as loud as the other keyboards ve had but this is why bought it to be soundless know keyboards won be silent but can tell why they put that in their description when it just as loud as other keyboards also when you aren typing and the lights are showing you can hear humming sound coming from the board and it doesn go away until the lights shut off do live the lighted keyboard just wish it bit more quiet 
1,i have used this for days realistically less bc it only used it won hold charge now and dies before lunch despite being plugged up over night 
1,this headset out performs those more expensive headsets on here am so impressed how good they perform that what call bang for your buck 
1,i love them it sounds great when use it on my xbox or on my cell phone 
1,very cool design thanks
1,i did lot of research on amazon looking for new cheaper gaming headset for my son he seems to have the worst luck when it comes to cheaper gaming headsets but guess you get what you pay for however with these they work great sound quality is good voice and mute work good the lights do not light up unless you have the usb cord connected to another source my son uses his for the ps so no lights for us doesn really matter though since he cannot see the lights anyway they work and that what matters most the extra connector does come in the box 
1,one of the best speakers in the market right now 
0,they are the worst the sound is ok but mic does not work it sounds like you are underwater when using them 
1,i am college student so naturally need mouse that lights up the picture made the mouse look so cool with the lights but the white mouse ordered was more of transparent white so the lights made the mouse look like something bought at swap meet super cheap now for the function it worked great for few months then the sensor on the bottom started to get an attitude with me wanted to go to the right of my screen and it would want to go left attempted to perform an exorcism on it just in case there was demon possessing it either did it wrong or the demon was too powerful for my faith or the mouse is malfunctioning ll let you decide the storyline on that one prior to it becoming possessed it worked great and charged up fast the charger is old school not usb 
0,it brought it month ago and it has already stopped working 
1,love it makes work so much easier the key board is flawless super happy but do wish there would be way to make the back lot brighter 
0,after only months my mouse no longer works am so upset because loveddddd this mouse it slim and fits in my laptop bag easily and everything it checked off everything on my list but no matter how long charge it now it will flash and stop working so sad and now the return window has passed and now can even return it

0,i initially liked this mouse but after month it stopped working terrible product waste of money
0,the keyboard works as it should for regular keyboard maybe just picky for gaming items they need to be quick and smooth this is not it works well for regular typing
1,i feel like pro gamer who gets no citches when have these on nd they my favorite color to on cripp
0,the sound quality is good for gaming
1,this mouse is good for its price its light and the clicking mechanism is actually quite nice when you press down it more of subtle soft click which like lot rather than an annoying and loud click however it does feel little cheap when you hold it and quality of the plastic is pretty low when using the led mode you can practically see inside the mouse once again though for it not bad like it because can connect it to my macbook air too which uses an usb 
1,tried to use this on work call with my laptop and on xbox for game session no one could hear me the mic has very low sound pick up also the microphone sits differently to the picture the picture makes it look close to the face mouth but when pulled into position you can not get it close to the side of your face let alone level with your mouth for sound the positive is that the lights are nice and they are comfortable on the ears 
0,it is terrible keyboard there is nothing good can say about this piece of junk 
1,overall great product really like the feature of connecting another to it take this on bike rides and my buddy who has one shares music on both speakers as we ride it has one speaker but sounds great in small to medium size rooms this thing holds it charge and great feature is that it also battery pack for cell phones 
1,loved this headset until weeks in the mic quit working 
1,my son got this for his birthday and he loves them 
1,very happy with this purchase and delivery
1,great sound and battery life the base was very impressive for speaker this size took it into the pool with no worries the feature of it being used as charger also came in handy recommend this speaker 
0, was in the market for new mouse as my logitech wireless was going bad on me was red to stay wireless and had budget the logitech and other named brands were just too expensive when wanted one that looked cool and the cheaper ones were too normal looking got this one as it was cheap and the led lights were cool feature got it and it feels great it feels like an apple mouse and the buttons were really quiet and didn have the typical mouse click sound edit had to get other mouse as my first broke it was completely my fault as it had fell and was stepped on by accident since it was so cheap just bought another and it works as well as the first 
0,the sound is going in and out shake the headset and the sound reconnects then it gone for the majority of the time terrible quality doesn last long at all 
0,great for chat in gameplay but my only issue is the cord piece for lights is not nearly long enough to plug into system for power 
1,works great love them only concern is it can not plug into my xbox controller it has to be plugged into the console but for pc gaming they are great 
0,so it has problems the biggest one was the move the cursor on it own like it just spazzes out could work with it didn mind it all that much besides it being real annoyance when gaming then it got more frequent and then the roller that scrolls broke and only had it for week or two so now got to replace it not great product looks nice but made cheap which suppose is why it is 
0,works on xboxdoes not work on pc or ps
1,my sony bluetooth speaker gave out replaced it with this unit and love it good volume and bass good enough for my and rock and roll taste 
0,the little wheel broke within the nd day
0,i ve used it times and it was fine and now it will not charge when plugged in shows red for about seconds and then nothing likes the mouse if it would work very disappointed in this product 
1,sounds really good like it lot 
1,sound is good but still hear things unless it on blast the mic is meh but it easy on your head
1,the ear cups fit really good have not had chance to use for skype or other mic features so can say on that it does come with mic speaker split connector which it does say you need to order led are bright 
0,it does what it supposed to do 
0,my box was smashed and opened like if someone opened up looked inside and closed it 
1,i absolutely love this mouse first off have to say my cat has knocked this done off the table multiple times and it still works that is huge with me next it very nice mouse love the colors it lights up with its so nice to not have to worry about battery too just plug in and charge and ready to go swear charge it like once month too and it still works great highly recommend this mouse

0,nice
1,all is great could be little bigger
0,product is as described pleased with my purchase 
1,arrived fast high quality headset has an awesome cord and nice volume control you gotta try this headset out 
1,great sound
1,i believe this is great purchase the size is not too small and not too large its shape is thin but comfortable the lighting is glamorous do use it on my laptop at home about week because of this shut the mouse off to save on the charge but have to say that the charge does hold for long time if you forget cord is provided and it measures about long which is perfect to plug in and continue to use the mouse as you work the price is reasonable and worth it would like to purchase another for work but fear that its projected beauty may peek someone interest 
0,great quality got them while on sale but knowing their quality would have paid full price
1,very nice keyboard easy to set up easy to use all the keys function great 
1,works great with when playing roblox 
1,i ve tried so many wireless mice over the years and one of the most annoying has always been how quickly the battery dies and they are not included when ordered this mouse got it because it lit up and matches my laptop when got it was pleased to learn it was rechargeable mind blown and brilliant the mouse will go into sleep mode when you aren using it or you can turn it off and on easily perhaps the only con is that it doesn come with instructions absolutely love this mouse and highly recommend it 
1, really was waiting for use this mouse and everything ok great pink golden color amazing that is rechargeable and super ergonomic for edit my videos 
0,purchased these as quick fix for broken pair of quality headphones while my new ones arrived used for gaming only very big and bulky below average sound quality appreciate the lengthy wire they re ok 
0,the description says that it is adapter for macbook air this is not true you have to plug adapter into laptop and then the usb wireless tab into the adapter had know had to use an adapter would not have bought this can not return as need it now very disappointed 
0,on day the mouse doesn seem to be tracking well it behaves like it on an uneven surface mouse gets stuck for half second as your moving it then jumps despite being on completely smooth surface the build quality seems very poor
